THE DESCRIPTION and vse of his MAIESTIES Dials in Whitehall Garden.
THe stone whereon the Dials are described, is of the same length, bredth, and depth, with that which stood in the same place before. That, was of Cane stone, and of many pieces: this, all of one intire stone from Purbecke Quarrie. The base of it is a square of somewhat more then foure foote and a halfe, the height three foote and @: and so vnwrought
 contained about 80. feete, or fiue Tonne of Stone.
It is also wrought with the like Plaines and Concaues as the former; and so necessarily, the like lines to shewe the houre of the day. But the rest of the lines are much different, and most of them such as were not in the former Dials, and therefore I intend here to giue an account of them.
These Dials may bee distinguished according as they are described: either on the vpper part of the Stone; or on the sides, toward the East, West, North, South.
There be fiue Dialls described on the vpper part: foure on the foure Corners; and one in the middle, which is the chiefest of all, the great Horizontall Concaue.


The vse of the Circles on the Margent of the great Horizontall Concaue.
THe Margent of this Horizontall Concaue containeth foure Circles: whereof, the Vttermost is the Circle of the xij Moneths, conteining the seuerall dayes, the Dominicall letters, and the standing Festiualls: The Holy dayes, in Redde; The Garter dayes in Blue, and the common Saints dayes in Blacke. The vse of them may be;

1. To find the day of the Moneth belonging to the Festiuall.
THe Festiuall dayes are here set at the day of the Moneth, wherein they fall: As, the Feast of S. George, at the xxiij of Aprill; the Feast of S. Iames at the xxv of Iuly; and so the rest of the standing Festiuals. Easter, Whitsontide, and such
 like, could not bee set downe, because they are moueable.


2. To finde the day of the Weeke belonging to the Festiuall.
FIrst, consider some one day, which you know to fall on such a day of the weeke: that one may helpe you to find all the rest. As, knowing, that this yeere MDCXXIV. S. Georges day fell on the Friday; if you looke into this Circle, you shall finde it ouer against the letter A: then is A. the letter for Friday; B. for Saturday, and C. the Dominicall letter for this yeere: and so, the rest in their order. If now you would knowe, what day of the Weeke Christmas day falleth; looke into the moneth of December, and there you shall find it ouer against the letter B: which sheweth, that Christmas day, this yeere, falleth on Saturday.
The second Circle is of the twelue
 Signes: @ Aries: @ Taurus: @ Gemini: @ Cancer: @ Leo: @ Virgo: @ Libra: @ Scorpio: @ Sagittarius: @ Capricornus: @ Aquarius: @ Pisces: Each Signe being distinguished with his name and character, and diuided into 30. degrees. The vse of it may be,



The Day of the Moneth being knowen, to finde the Place of the Sunne.
THe day of the Moneth, and the Place of the Sunne, are here set, one against the other: So may you find, that on the xxiij. of April, being S. Georges day, the Sunne is in 13. Deg. of @. On the xxv. of Iuly, being S. Iames his day, the Sunne is in 11. Degrees, 50. Minutes of Leo.
There may be some small difference in time to come, in regard of the Leape yeere, as, of a quarter of a Degree, more or lesse; but, that could not be auoided. And this may serue for sixe score yeeres
 without one Degrees difference.
The third Circle, is a standing Compasse, diuided into thirty two points, with the name of each point in his due place: whereby you may see, vpon what point the Sunne beareth, and how the winde bloweth.
The fourth and innermost Circle containeth another description of the dayes of each moneth, fitted to the Concaue.


The description of the Concaue.
THe Concaue is twentie inches deepe, and fourtie inches ouer: and being halfe round resembleth that halfe of the heauens which may be seene.
The one part, which is drawen vpon the white ground, resembleth so much of the heauens, as is contained betweene the Tropiques. As, there, the Sunne hath all varietie of motion; so, heere, the point of the Style, all variety of shadow. The other part, which is on
 the Blue ground, is that part of the heauen, where the Sunne neuer commeth.
The Style belonging to the Concaue, is xx inches long, and about xiij inches broad at the foot. The one edge which is vpright, is the Axis of the Horizon, and with his shadow sheweth the Azimuth.
The other edge, inclining to the North, represents the Axis of the world, and with his shadow shewes the time of the day. The point of the style, with his shadow, will shew the rest of the conclusions.
The edge of the Concaue representeth the circle of the Horizon. The other seuerall Circles described in the Concaue, may be knowen and distinguished by their colours.
The Aequator, the Tropiques, and the Ecliptique, and the Parallels of Declination, are all drawen in Red lines.
The Parallels of the Horizon, to shew the Sunnes altitude, in Yellow.

The Verticall circles are drawen in Blew.
The olde vnaequall (which some call Planetarie) houres, in Greene.
The common houres, in Blacke.
The dayes fitted to the Sunnes rising and setting, are drawen in the margent. And, so much is intimated in those eight Latine verses, which are written on the Concaue:
Aequator, Tropicique and Declinatio Solis,Et Via Solaris tramite ducta rubro.Lineolis flauis, Solis conscensus habetur;Caeruleo tractu, Verticis vmbra cadit.Hora Planetarum, Viridi est signata colore*Horaque Vulgaris nota colore nigro.Ortus and Occasus Solis, Spaciumque diei,Atque Dies mensis, Margine scripta patent.


The vse of the Blacke Lines.
THat Line which is drawen from the South to the North, whereon the Style is set, is the Meridian circle. The rest drawen on either side of the Meridian, in White vpon the Blue; and in
 Blacke vpon the White ground, are the Houre circles. Those which doe shew the houres complete, are drawen with broader lines. Each houre is diuided, first into fifteene parts with small lines, euery part being foure minutes: And each part is againe subdiuided into foure parts more, with little blacke strokes, at the beginning, middle, and end of the former lines: And so, the whole houre is actually diuided into sixtie Minutes. Of which, that line which signifieth twentie Minutes, and, that which signifieth 40. Minutes complete, are, for distinction sake, crossed with little Redde strokes. The vse of them may be,

1. To shew the Houre and Minute of the day by the shadow of the Style.
THe houre of the day will be found, at one time or other, in more then fourescore seuerall places of this Stone: but no where so well, as in this Horizontall
 Concaue. For, the houre is found on the East side of the Stone, onely in the morning; and on the West side, onely in the euening: On the South side, onely in the middle of the day; on the North side, either early in the morning, or late in the euening: On the Aequinoctiall plaines, either onely in the Summer, or onely in the Winter: Here, it is found generally, both in Summer and Winter, morning and euening, and at all houres of the day. Not onely, the houre and quarter, (as in the rest of these Dials) but, the houre and minute: with many other conclusions answerable, which may not be expected in any Diall of another forme.
When the Sunne shineth, obserue the shadow of the Style among the houre lines; the shadow of the one edge will commonly crosse the houre lines, and so, is vnfit for this purpose; but the shadow of the other edge, which leanes to the Northward, will alwayes fall, either betweene two houre lines, or vpon one
 of them; and the houre line, where it falleth, will giue the houre and minute required.


1. To shew the houre and minute of the Sunnes rising and setting, and the length of the Day, at all times of the yere, though the Sunne doe not shine.
FIrst, find the day of the moneth, in the inner circle of the Margent; (which, from the eleuenth of December vntill the eleuenth of Iune, while the dayes are encreasing, will be found on the West part of the Concaue;) and there, the houre line which is drawen vp to the Day, will giue you the houre and minute of the Sunnes rising. But, from the eleuenth of Iune vntill the eleuenth of December, while the dayes are decreasing, the Day will be found on the East side of the Concaue: and there, the houre line which is drawen vp to the Day, will giue the
 houre and minute of the Sunnes setting: and, the one being knowen will giue the other.
As, if it were required, to know, what time the Sunne riseth and setteth, on the fourth day of Februarie. This moneth is found on the West part of the Concaue; and the houre-line, which meeteth with the fourth day of this moneth, is that of 7. Ho. 8. Min in the morning; and, such is the time of the Sunnes rising: But, so much as the Sunne riseth before noone, so much he setteth after noone, within a minute more or lesse, and therefore the time of the Sunnes setting is about 4. Ho. 52. Minutes after noone.


3. To shew the day of the moneth, when the Sunne riseth or setteth at any houre and minute.
ON the contrary, if you would finde the Day, when the Sunne riseth or setteth at any houre, First find the houre-line in the Concaue, and that will leade
 you to the day of the moneth in the Margent.
As, if it were required, On what Day the Sunne riseth at fiue in the morning: first finde the houre-line of fiue, in the West part of the Concaue, and that will leade you to the tenth day of April. Then, because the Sunne, rising at fiue, doeth set at seuen, if you finde out the houre-line of seuen after noone, it will leade you to the thirteenth day of August, which shewes, that the Sunne riseth at fiue in the morning, and setteth at seuen after noone, both on the tenth day of April, and the thirteenth of August.
The like reason holdeth for the rising and setting of the Sunne at all other times of the yeere: as may appeare, by comparing the Concaue with the Table following.

The Concaue and this Table are both made for the Latitude of 51. gr. 30. seruing for London, and such places as lie East or West from London in the same Latitude. But, if you goe from London, either Northward or Southward, there will be some small difference. For, here at London, vpon the longest day, the Sunne setteth at 8. Hou. 13. Min. and so the length of the day is 16. Houres, 26. Minutes. About Sillie, and the Lizard, the Southermost parts of England, in the Latitude of 50. gr. the Sunne setteth at 8. Ho. 5. Min. And so, their longest day is about 16. Ho. 10. Min.
About an hundred miles Northward from London, the Sunne setteth at 8. Ho. 22. Min. And so, their longest day is 16. Hou. 44. Minutes.
About Edenborough in the Latitude of 56. gr. the Sunne setteth at 8. Ho. 40. Min. And so, their longest day is 17. Houres, 20. Minutes.
About the Orcades, in the Latitude of 60. gr. the Sunne setteth at 9. Ho. 15. Min.
 And so, their longest day is 18. Houres, 30. Minutes.



The vse of the Red Lines.
THe Red Lines, drawne crosse the the Houre lines, are of seuerall sortes, all tending to shew the motion of the Sunne. That which is drawne in the middle of the white ground, directly from East to West, is the Aequator.
The other two, which are drawne from West to East, diuided into degrees, and noted with @ @ @, etc. doe make vp the Ecliptique.
The two vttermost are the two Tropiques: That which is farthest from the Style, touching the Ecliptique in the beginning of @, is therefore called the Tropique of Capricorne.
That which is neerer the Style touching the Ecliptique in the beginning of @, is the Tropique of Cancer.
The other intermediate Redde Lines
 drawne betweene the Aequator and the Tropiques are Parallels of Declination, numbred at the Meridian, with 5, 10, 15, 20, according to their distance from the Aequator. The vse of them may be,

1. To shew the Declination of the Sun by the shadow of the Style.
WHen the Sunne shineth, obserue the shadow of the point of the Style among the Red lines. If it fall on the Aequator, the Sunne is at one of the Aequinoctiall points, either the beginning of @ or of @, and so hath no declination. If it fall on the Tropique of Cancer, the Sunne is at the highest, and the day at the longest. If on the Tropique of Capricorne,, the Sunne is at the lowest, and the dayes at the shortest. If it fall on any of the Parallel lines betweene the Aequator and the Tropiques, the distance of that line from the Aequator, shall bee the declination of the Sunne.
As, if the shadow of the top of the
 style shall fall on any part of the tenth Parallel aboue the Aequator, it shewes, the Sunne to be at 10. gr. of South declination: If on the twentieth Parallel belowe the Aequator, then is the declination of the Sunne 20. gr. from the Aequator Northward.


2. To shew the day of the moneth, by the shadow of the style.
THe shadow of the point of the style will shew the declination; and the line of Declination will leade you to the Day of the Moneth, at the Margent of the Concaue.
As, if the shadow of the top of the style shall fall on any part of the thirteenth Parallel aboue the Aequator, it shewes the Sunne to bee at 13 gr. of South declination; and that Parallel of declination will leade you to the fourth of February, on the West side, and to the seuenteenth of October on the East
 side of the Concaue: But, which of these two is the true day of the moneth, must bee knowne, either by the time of the yeere, or the second dayes obseruation.


3. To shew the Place of the Sunne by the shadow of the Style.
THe shadow of the point of the style will shew the Declination; and the intersection of the Parallel of Declination, with the Ecliptique, will bee the Place of the Sunne.
As, if the shadow of the top of the style fall on 13, gr. of South Declination, this Parallel of Declination will crosse the Ecliptique neere 26 gr. of @, on the one side, and about the fourth of @ on the other side of the Concaue: But, which of these two is the true Place of the Sunne, will bee knowne by the day of the moneth neerest vnto the Signe of the Sunne.



4. To shew the Houre and Minute of the Sunnes rising and setting, by the shadow of the Style.
THe shadow of the top of the Style will shew the Declination, and the houre-line, which meetes that Parallel of Declination at the Horizon (here represented by the edge of the Margent) shall giue the houre and minute of the Sunnes rising and setting.
As, if the Shadow of the top of the Style fall on 13. gr. of South declination, that Parallel of Declination, being followed to the Horizon at the West side of the Concaue, will there meete at the houre-line of seuen, and eight Minutes, and, such is the time of the Sunnes rising. Then follow this Parallel, to the Horizon, vnto the East side of the Concaue, and it will there meete with the houre-line of IIII. and 52. Min. which is the
 time of the Sunnes setting. And the line betweene 7. Ho. 8. Min. in the morning, and 4. Ho. 52. Min. after noone, is the length of the Day.


5. To find the Declination of the Sunne by knowing the day of the moneth.
FIrst, find the Day of the Moneth in the inner Circle of the Margent; then, looke among the Red lines for the Parallel of Declination, which is drawen vp to that Day: the distance of that Parallel, from the Aequator, shall shew you the Declination of the Sunne.
As, if it were required, to finde the declination of the Sunne, for the fourth day of February: the Parallel drawen vp to this day will be found about 13 gr. aboue the Aequator: And such is the Declination of the Sunne to the Southward.



6. To finde the Place of the Sun by knowing the Day of the moneth.
THe Day of the Moneth will giue the Declination of the Sunne; and the Parallel of Declination, will crosse the Ecliptique in the Place of the Sunne.
As, if the Day giuen be the fourth of February, the Parallel of Declination will be found to be 13. gr. Southward; and this Parallel doeth crosse the Ecliptique in the 26. gr. of @: which is the Place of the Sunne required.



The vse of the Blue lines.
THe vse of the Blue lines drawen from the bottome to the edge of the Concaue is, to represent the Verticall circles, commonly called by the Arabian name, Azimuthes. These are, all, great Circles, drawen through the Zenith and the Nadir, and doe diuide the Horizon into aequall
 parts. The Meridian is one of them: But, the prime Verticall circle is that, which is drawen from East to West. These two diuide the Horizon into foure aequall parts: Each of these parts is diuided, by Sea-men, into eight; and so, the whole into thirtie two points of the Compasse. But, Astronomers diuide each fourth part into 90. Degrees. I haue here set the points of the Compasse in the bottome of the Concaue, and at the Margent; and the Astronomicall diuisions, betweene the Tropiques. The vse of them may be,

1. To shew the Azimuth or Point of the Compasse, whereon the Sunne beareth from vs; how farre he is from the South; how neere to the East or West; and that, by the shadow of the Style.
VVHen the Sunne shineth, obserue, where the shadow of the vpright
 edge of the style falleth among the Azimuth lines, the distance of that line from the Meridian, shall shewe the Azimuth, whereon the Sunne beareth.
As, if on the fourth of February about 10. Ho. 5. Min. in the morning, the shadow of the vpright edge of the style fall on the third of the Blue lines from the Meridian, then is the Sunne 30. gr. from the South. If you follow this Blue line vnto the margent, it will there point betweene N W by N, and N N W wherefore it beareth from you on the contrary point betweene S E by S, and S S E.

2. To find on what Azimuth or Point of the Compasse the Sunne riseth or setteth.FIrst find the day of the moneth in the inner circle of the Margent: then look among the Blue lines for the Azimuth which is drawen vp to the day: the distance of that line from the line of East
 and West, shall giue the amplitude of the Sunnes rising and setting. If the day fall on the West side of the Concaue, the point opposite to the day, is the true point of the Sunnes rising: If the day fall on the East part of the Concaue, the point opposite to the day, is the true point of the Sunnes setting.As, if the day proposed were the fourth of Februarie: This moneth is found on the West part of the Concaue, and the day falleth neere the point of W N W, whose opposite point is E S E, the point of the Compasse whereon the Sunne riseth. Or, if you looke among the Blue lines in the Concaue, you shall finde the Azimuth which is drawen vp to the day, to be about 21 gr. from the line of East and West; which shewes, that the Amplitude of the Sunnes rising is about 21 gr. from the East.The like reason holdeth for all other times of the yeere, as may appeare by comparing the Concaue with the Table following.
(...)

The Concaue and this Table, are both made for the Latitude of 51 gr. 30 Min. seruing for London, and such places as lie East or West from London in the same Latitude. But, if you goe from London either Northward or Southward, there will bee some small difference.
For, here at London the greatest Amplitude is 39 gr. 50 min. that is, when the dayes are at the longest, the Sunne riseth 39 gr. 50 min. from the East Northward; and setteth 39 gr. 50. min. from the West Northward: when the dayes are at the shortest, he riseth 39 gr. 50 min. from the East Southward, and setteth as much from the West Southward.
About Sillie and the Lizard, the Southermost parts of England, in the Latitude of 50 Degr. the greatest Amplitude will be 38 Degr. 20 min.

About the North of England in the Latitude of 55 Degr. 40 Min. the greatest Amplitude will be 45 Gr. And so, when the dayes are at the longest, the Sunne will rise due North-East, and set in the North-west. When the dayes are at the shortest, he will rise in the South-east, and sette in the South-west.
About the North of Scotland in the Latitude of 60 Gr. the greatest Amplitude will be about 52 Degr. 50 Min. And, after you come to 66 degr. of Latitude, you may see the Sunne in the North.


3. To find the Azimuth or Point of the Compasse whereon the Sunne beareth, for all houres of the day, at any time of the yeere.
THe time of the yeere is here represented by the Red Parallel lines of Declination; the time of the day, by the Blacke houre-lines. First, find, where these two
 doe meete, and then see, which of the Blue lines would passe through that intersection; The distance of that Blue line from the line of East and West shall giue the Azimuth required.
As, if the day proposed were the sixth day of April, and it were required to know the Azimuth whereon the Sunne beareth at 9. Ho. 45. Min. in the morning. This moneth is found on the West part of the Concaue, and the Parallel of Declination drawen vp to the sixth day of this moneth, is about 10 Degrees distant from the Aequator: This Parallel doth crosse the houre-line of 9 Ho. 45 Mi. in the middle betweene two Blue Azimuth lines, and following this middle vnto the Margent, I find there, it directs me to the point N W, in the inner circle; and so, to 45 Degr. from the West in the middle Circle of the Margent, which shewes, that the Sunne is in the opposite point 45 degr. distant from the East, vpon the Southeast point of the Compasse.



4. To finde the Houre and Minute when the Sun shall come to any Azimuth, at all times of the yeere.
AS, if it were required, to know, at what houre the Sunne would be in the East, on the longest day of the yeere.
The Sunne riseth in the East, at VI. in the morning, and setteth in the West, at VI. in the euening, about the tenth of March, and the thirteenth of September: but, all other times of the yeere, it will be past VI. in the morning before hee come to the East, and he will be past the West before VI. of the clocke in the euening. As here the Tropique of Cancer, which is the Parallel of the longest day, doth crosse the West Azimuth at 7. Ho. 22. Min. in the morning; And such is the time of the Sunnes comming to the East.



5. To find the Day of the Moneth when the Sunne commeth to any Point of the Compasse at any houre proposed.
AS, if it were required, to find the day of the moneth when the Sunne shall come to due East, at VII. in the morning; I shall finde that the houre-line of VII. in the morning doeth crosse the West Azimuth at the Parallel of 18. degr. of North Declination; and this Parallel doth leade me to the first of May on the West side, and to the two and twentieth of Iuly, on the East side of the Concaue: which shewes, that the Sun will be due East at seuen in the morning, and due West at fiue in the euening, both, on the first of May, and the xxijth. of Iuly.



The vse of the Yellow lines.
THe Yellow lines are, all of them, lesser Circles, drawen vpon the same center in the bottome of the Concaue; and
 so, Parallel one to the other; representing the Parallels of Altitude, commonly called, by the Arabian name, Almicanters. There be sixtie two of them; and they be numbred, both at the Meridian, and at the Tropique of Cancer, in Yellow Figures with 5, 10, 15, etc. according to their distance from the Horizon, which is heere represented by the edge of the Concaue. The vse of them is,

1. To finde the Altitude of the Sunne aboue the Horizon.
WHen the Sunne shineth, obserue the shadow of the Style, that falleth among the Yellow lines; The distance of that Yellow Parallel from the Horizon shall giue the Parallel of the Sunnes altitude aboue the Horizon.
As, if the shadow of the top of the Style shall fall on any part of the tenth Parallel, it shewes the Sun to be at 10 gr. of altitude aboue the Horizon. And so, in the rest.



2. To finde the Altitude of the Sunne for any Day and Houre proposed. 3. To finde the Altitude of the Sunne for any Day and Azimuth proposed. 4. To finde the Altitude of the Sunne for any Houre and Azimuth proposed.
THese and such like Propositions, with their conuerses, depend vpon the meeting of these Yellow lines at the intersection of any two of the other lines before described.
As, if it were required, to find, what altitude the Sunne shall haue, on the sixt day of April at nine of the clocke in the morning. First, find the Parallel of declination, belonging to the Day, and his intersection with the houre-of nine in the morning; then may you finde, the
 Yellow line drawen through this intersection to be neere 35 Degr. distant from the edge of the Concaue; And, such will be the altitude of the Sunne aboue the Horizon, at the time proposed. The like reason holdeth for all the rest.



The vse of the Greene lines.
IT was the maner of the Ancients, to diuide the day into twelue houres, and the night into other twelue houres: but, the houres of the day were commonly either longer or shorter then the houres of the night, and the Summer houres alwayes longer then the Winter houres: whereupon, they are called the olde, vnaequall; and (by some) the Planetarie houres.
These houres, for the day, are heere represented by the Greene lines, and are numbred in Greene figures by 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. at the Tropique of Capricorne. The vse of them is,


1. To finde the olde, vnaequall houre of the day.
WHen the Sunne shineth, obserue the shadow of the top of the style, among the Greene lines; the line next after the shadow shall giue the houre required.
As, if the shadow of the top of the Style shall fall betweene the Horizon and the Greene line noted with 1, it is the first houre: If betweene the first houre-line and the second, it is the second houre: If it fall directly on the second houre, it is the second houre complete, according to the accompt of the Ancients.


2. To compare the old vnaequall houres with the houres of the Clocke.
AS, if it were required, to know what houre of the day, it would be, at nine of the clocke in the morning vpon the longest day.

First, finde the Parallel of the day, and his intersection with the houre of IX, then may you finde this intersection to fall betweene the third and the fourth of the greene lines; and so it is the fourth houre of the Day. For, when the dayes are at the longest with vs, the first houre beginneth at III of the clocke and 47 Min. in the Morning, and endeth at V and 9 Min. The second houre beginneth where the first endeth, and is complete at VI and 31 Min. The third houre is complete at VII and 53 Min. The fourth, at IX and 15 Mi. The fift, at X and 37 Mi. The sixt houre alwayes endeth at high noone: and the rest in the like order: each of these twelue Houres beeing equall to 1 Ho. 22 Min. of the Clocke.
At the two Aequinoctiall dayes, when the Sunne riseth at sixe, and setteth at sixe, these houres of the day will bee equall to the houres of the Clocke: But, in the depth of Winter, one of these houres, will be but 38 Minutes of a common houre.




The vse of the Circle of the Age of the Moone.
THe Circle drawne at the roote of the Style, diuided with blacke strokes into 29@, representeth the Age of the Moone: The other Circle within it, diuided with white strokes into 24, representeth the Houres of the Day, and beeing continued, would agree with the Houre lines betweene the Tropiques.
The vse of these Circles, is;

1. Knowing the Age of the Moone, to finde the time when she commeth to the South.
FIrst, finde the Age of the Moone in the outward Circle, so, the next Houre line, in the inward Circle, shall giue you the time when she commeth to the South.
Thus, you may find, that if the Moone
 be ten dayes old, she wil be in the South, at eight of the Clocke in the Euening: If fifteene dayes old, then about twelue of the clocke at midnight: If twenty fiue dayes old, then at eight in the Morning: And vpon this it followeth;


2. Knowing the Age of the Moone, to find the time when it will bee high water.
FIrst, inquire what difference there is betweene the time of the Moones comming to the South, and the time of High water; for, that once knowne, is knowne for euer. For example, It is commonly sayd, that when the Moone commeth to the Southwest, it will bee High water at London bridge; and this is about three houres after her comming to the South. And againe when shee commeth to the Northeast, which is about three houres after her comming to the North part of the Meridian.

Suppose then, that the Moone is ten dayes old, then will she be in the South, by the former Proposition, at Eight in the Euening, or in the North at Eight in the Morning, adde vnto this three houres more, and it will be High water at Eleuen of the Clocke.


3. Knowing the Age of the Moon, to finde the houre of the night, by the shadow of the Style.
THe houre of the Moone from the Meridian, may bee found out at any time when the Moone shineth; by the shadow of the Style, in such sort as we finde the houre of the Day when the Sunne shineth. For, if the Moone bee in the South, shee will cast the shadow of the Style vpon the houre of XII; and if shee cast a shadow vpon I, or II, it shewes that shee is accordingly either one houre, or two, or more past the Meridian.
Suppose the Moone to be ten dayes
 old, and that she did cast a shadow vpon the houre of V after noone; I would then say it were about one of the clocke in the morning: For, the Moone being ten dayes old, she commeth to the South at VIII in the Euening, and therefore, when shee is fiue houres past the South, it must bee I, in the morning.



The description and vse of the four Corner Dials.
THe foure Triangular Dials at the Corners of the Stone, decline from the prime verticall, and incline to the Horizon.
In these, The Blacke lines shew the ordinary Houres: the Redde lines shew the Summer, and Winter, and the Aequinoctiall shadow.
If the shadow of the top of the Style shall fall vpon the middle Red line noted with @ and @, then is the Sunne in the Aequinoctiall:
It falleth vpon the Line noted with
 @, in the height of Summer; and vpon the Line noted with @, in the depth of Winter.
1 The Blue lines at the Northeast Corner, noted with 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. shewe the Houres from the Sunne rising. The shadow of the top of the Style will fall vpon the Line of 1, at one houre after the Sunne rising, and vpon the houre of 2, when the Sunne is two houres high in the East.
2 The Blue lines at the Northwest Corner, noted with 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. shew the houres from Sunne setting. The shadow of the top of the Style will fall vpon the Line of 2, when the Sunne is two houres high in the West: and vpon the Line of 1, when the Sunne wants but one houre of setting.


The description and vse of the Dials on the South side of the stone.
THe South side of the stone hath many Dialls:

One great Verticall Diall:
Two Aequinoctiall Dials, whereon the Sunne neuer shineth but in Winter:
One Verticall Concaue in the middle:
Two Declining Dials, on either side of this Concaue:
Two small Polar Concaues:
Two Irregular Dials, with three Styles in each Diall:
Of these, the Aequinoctiall, the Decliners, and the Irregular Dials haue onely Blacke lines to shewe the Ordinary Houres: But the great Verticall, and the three Concaues, as they haue lines of different colours, so they are such as were not on the former Stone.
The Lines drawne on the great Verticall, may be knowen and distinguished in this maner: The Aequator, the Tropiques and the Parallels of the length of the day, are all drawne in Red lines: The Houre-lines from the Sun-rising, in Yellow: The Italian houre-lines from the last Sun-setting in Blue. And so much is there intimated in foure Latine verses:
Vmbrarum metas, Occasum Solis and Ortum,Et quam longa dies, Linearubra dabit:Flaua, a Sole oriente horas; a Sole cadente,Caerulea, Italico, Linea, more, notat.


The vse of the Red Lines in finding,
1. The Length of the Day.2. The Time of the Sunnes rising.3. The Time of the Sunnes setting.
ALl varietie of shadowes is bounded betweene the two extreme Redde Lines.
The vppermost, noted with @, representeth the Tropique of Capricorne: And when the shadow of the top of the Style shall fall on this line, then is the Sunne at the lowest, and the Dayes at the shortest.
The lowermost, noted with @. is the Tropique of Cancer: when the shadow commeth to this line, then is the Sunne at the highest, and the dayes at the longest.

The other Red lines, noted in the middle with 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, are Parallels of the length of the Day.
The streight line drawen in the middle, noted with @ and @, is the Aequinoctiall. Vpon this line is written, 6 at the one end, 12 in the middle, and 6 at the other end. This shewes, that when the shadow of the top of the Style shall fall on this line, then is the Sunne in the Aequinoctiall; the length of the Day is twelue houres; the Sunne riseth at VI, and setteth at VI. In like manner, If the shadow shall fall vpon the line noted with 10; it sheweth, that the length of the day is ten houres; the Sunne riseth at VII in the morning, and setteth at V, in the euening.
At the end of these Red lines, are the Signes and the Moneths; thereby to shew the Place of the Sunne, and the Time of the Yeere. As, at the one ende of the Aequinoctiall, there is the Signe of Aries, and the Moneth of March: at the other end, the Signe of Libra, and the Moneth
 of September: which shew, that in these moneths, the Sun will be in these Signes, the shadow will fall on these Parallels, and there shew the length of the Day, as before. Et e conuerso.


The vse of the Yellow Lines; in shewing the houres past since the Sunne-rising.
THe streight line drawen betweene the Blue and the White grounds representeth the Horizon: for when the Sunne commeth to the Horizon, either at his rising, or at his setting, the shadow of the top of the Style will fall vpon this line.
The Yellow lines noted with 1 2, 3, 4, etc. doe shew the houres after the Sun-rising, according to the distance from the Horizon.
As, if the shadow of the top of the Style shall fall on any part of the yellow line noted with 1, it shewes, that the Sunne is an houre high: If on the like
 line noted with 2, then are there two houres past, betweene that and the time of the Sunnes rising.


The vse of the Blue Lines in shewing the houres past since the last Sunne-setting.
IN Italy (as Trauailers say) the Clocke strikes twentie foure at Sunne setting; at one houre after, it strikes one; and then, two, three, and so forward vntill the next Sunnes setting. So that, if the day shall be eight houres long, it will strike sixteene at Sunne rising, and twenty at high noone: If the day shall be sixteene houres long, it will strike eight at Sunne-rising, and sixteene at high noone. These houres are heere represented in Blue lines.
As, if on the tenth of our April, at X of our clocke in the morning, you obserue the shadow of the top of the Style, you shall find it to fall among the
 Red lines on the Parallel of 14; on the line of 5, among the Yellow lines; and, on the line of 15, among the Blue lines: which shewes, that the length of that Day is 14 houres; and the time of the Day, 5 houres from the Sunnes rising, and 15 houres from the last Sunnes setting.
In the Verticall Concaue, at the middle of the South side of the Stone, this verse is written:
Horae vulgares, and Signa in culmine coeli.
The lines there drawen are of three sorts: The common houre-lines are drawen in Blacke: The Aequator and Tropiques drawen in Redde, as in the other Dials. The other lines noted with @, @, @, etc. are the lines of the twelue Signes.


To shew, which of the xij Signes is in the Meridian.
ALl the twelue Signes doe passe, by the Meridian, in xxiiij houres, but,
 vnaequally; some, in lesse time then two houres; some in more.
When the Sunne shineth, obserue, where the shadow of the toppe of the Style falleth among these lines of Signes; for, that sheweth the Signe which is then in the South, and so, passing by the Meridian.
As the Sunne, being in the Aequinoctiall, at IX of the Clocke in the morning, the shadow falleth vpon @ and (...): If the Sunne be in @, then is the Signe of @ in the Meridian; If in @, then it is the Signe of @. But, when the Sunne commeth to the Tropique of Cancer, the shadow will fall, at IX in the morning, vpon the Signe of @; and that is the Signe which is then in the Meridian.
In the two Polar Concaues on the South side of the Stone, there are lines noted with these words, Aequalis, Dupla, Tripla, Quadrupla, etc.
The vse of them is,



To shew the Proportion of Shadowes to their Bodies.
AS, when the shadow of the top of the Style shall fall vpon the line noted with this word, Aequalis; then, is the shadow of a man, vpon a leuell ground, aequall to his height. When it falleth vpon the line noted with the word Dupla, then will his shadow be double vnto his height. And so, for the rest.
These Proportions being thus known, you may take the length of the Shadow, and so, finde the height of the body, when it cannot otherwise be so easily measured.



The Description and Vse of the Dials on the North side of the Stone.
THe Sunne shineth on the North side of the stone, onely in the Summer; and then, early in the morning, before it shineth on the South side; or, late in the euening, after it hath left shining on the South side of the stone: And therefore I haue drawen heere such lines as may answere to them on the South side.
In the Verticall Concaue on this North side, the Red lines shewe the Signes, and the Place of the Sunne: The Blue lines noted with Dupla, Tripla, Quadrupla, etc. doe shew the Proportion of shadowes to their Bodies.
In the two side Inclining Dials, the Red lines, noted with 16, 15, 14, etc. doe serue to shewe the length of the Day: and the Blue lines, the houres from Sunne rising and Sunne setting.



The Description and vse of the Dials on the East and West sides of the Stone.
THe Sunne shineth on the East side of the stone, onely in the morning; on the West side, onely in the afternoone; and not on both at once; and therefore I haue made them one answering the other.
Either side hath foure great Dials, of seuerall formes: A Meridian Plaine; a Meridian Concaue; a Meridian Cylinder Diall; and a Square hollow Diall of many sides.
Ouer the Meridian Plaine, on the one side, these verses are written, shewing the vse of the Lines according to their colours.
Horas antiquas, Viridis; Rubra linea, Signa Monstrat; Caeruleus, nautica puncta, color.
On the other side, these verses, to the like effect:
Caeruleo, dantur communes Azimuth; Horae Antiquae, Viridi; Signa, colore Rubro.
THe Red lines doe here represent the Signe and Place of the Sunne. For, the Sunne shining, the shadow of the edge of the top of the Style falling among the Blacke lines will shew the ordinarie houres: And the shadow of the lower point of that edge falling among the Red lines will there shew the Signe of the Place of the Sunne, according to the characters @, @, @, @, etc. noted in the Ellipsis.
The Greene lines do shew the Old, Vnaequall, Planetary houres, diuiding the Day into twelue equall parts; for, the Greene line which followeth next after the shadow, will giue the houre required.
The Blue lines, noted with E, E b S, E S E, etc. doe shew the common Azimuths, or (as Seamen call them) the Points of the Compasse, whereon the Sunne beareth from vs. For, if the point of the shadow doe fall vpon the line noted with E, then is the Sunne in the East: If
 it fall on the line noted with E b S, then, the Sunne beareth from vs East and by South.
In the Square hollow Dialls of many sides, the Blacke lines doe shew the Ordinary Houres, and the Redde lines represent the Aequator, and his Parallels of declination. For, heere, if the Sunnes beame passing through the little hole in the side of the Square shall fall on any part of the Red line, 10 gr. aboue the Aequinoctiall line, then is the declination of the Sunne 10 gr. to the Southward: If on 20 gr. below the Aequinoctiall line, then is the Sunne 20 Degrees from the Aequator Northward.
In the Meridian Concaue, on the East side of the Stone, is written this verse,
Horae vulgares, atque ascendentia Signa.
In the Meridian Concaue, on the West side,
Horae vulgares, and descendentia Signa.
The Lines heere drawne are of three
 sortes: The Common houre lines are drawne in Blacke: The Aequator, and the Tropiques are drawne in Redde, as in the other Dials: The other lines noted with @, @, @, @, etc. are the lines of the twelue Signes.


To shew, which of the xij Signes is at the Horizon.
ALl the twelue Signes doe rise and and sette in xxiiij houres, but, vnequally: Some are neere three houres in rising, others doe rise in lesse time then an houre.
Heere, it sufficeth onely to obserue the shadow of the toppe of the Style; For, it will fall vpon the Signe, which is rising, if the Sunne shine on the East side: or vpon the Signe which is then descending, if the Sunne doe shine on the West side of the Stone.
In the Meridian Cylinders are two Geographicall Tables: One, on the East
 side of the Stone, of such places as are East from London: The other, on the West side, of such places as lie West from London. And these are described, according to their due Latitude and Longitude, in such sort, that the same lines which shew the houre of the Day, doe also shew the difference of Longitude.
The vse of them may bee,

1. To shew the time, when it is noone in any of those Countreys.
SVch places as lie East from London haue noone before vs: Such as lie West from London haue noone after vs.
But to finde the time more particularly, obserue the shadow of the Style which sheweth the houre of the Day; For, when that commeth to be ouer any place in the Chart, then is it Noone in that place.
Thus, the shadow of the Style comming to the Meridian of Hierusalem, at the houre of IX in the morning, it
 sheweth, that it is Noone at Hierusalem, when it is but nine of the Clocke with vs at London.


2. To shew the time of the Day agreeing to any of those Countreys.
FIrst, finde the Meridian of the Place proposed; then, see where the shadow falleth: So, the distance in houres, between the shadow and that Meridian, shall giue the time of the Day required.
As if, it being Noone at Rome and Venice, it were required to finde the houre of the Day at Hierusalem.
It appeareth, by the former Proposition, that it is Noone at Rome and Venice, at such time as it is about eleuen of the Clocke at London, and, that there is two houres difference between the Meridian of Rome and the Meridian of Hierusalem; and therefore, at Hierusalem it is two of the Clocke after noone at the time proposed.

And what is here said of the Day, the same may be vnderstood of the time of the Night. It appeareth, by the former Proposition, that it is noone at Virginia, at such time, as it is V of the Clocke after noone with vs at London; and therefore, fiue houres difference, betweene the Meridians of Virginia and London; so that, I suppose, if they at Virginia, and wee at London, could see one and the same thing, at the same instant of time (as sometimes, wee may, either the beginning or the end of an Eclipse of the Moone) if wee see it at midnight, they should see it at VII of their Clocke in the Euening; Or, if they see it at VIII in the Euening, wee shall see it at One in the Morning.
These, and such like, are the vses of these Dials: if too obscurely deliuered, your Maiestie may command the Author.
