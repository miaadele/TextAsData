the good part^s in he can prosper little or no a peerance can by of his furtherance or good success hardly any body can trust in he or hope of any good proceed of his he be to by little esteem in referinge to his charge any office or command no man of quality and good part can trust in he or keep he company he which intere into this noble profession of arm ought to shun eschew and forsake all baseness imagine and think of mane mind and he ought diligent to applee himself to learn the art of war from whence proceed all nobility and whereby many man of low degree and base linadge have attain into high degree dignity and fame as CAIUS MARIUS decend of poor and vile parent in a viladge of the arpines come to by a roman emperor and trough his virtue VALINCIAN a po^^e man be son of cibaly in

come into the lick and semblable dingnity and credit and raise unto honourable degree and reputation of perpetual memory so let none by ingnorante that virtue and brave conduction be the true way of proceed in the noble profession of arm let he always with a pure and senseare heart above all thing by careful to serve God for although all profession be thereunto bind yet none more deep than the brave soldier who be day and night in danger of death more than any other and douptles he that so do a accomplish fight with a more resolute determination and such man most common be a fist by the divine power fight in a just cause and with a clear conscience where of there have be to many example which I have read in antciente and note myself the same in many he be always bind to by careful and vigilant in acomplish his and principal to by obedient for mishinge this point the other good part which in he do ocurr be of little or no estimation above all thing let he always live in the fear of God and let he by no blasphemer for in this world it be most o diouse and can not escape without severe punishment of his divine majesty whereof their have be many example and we see that such blasphemer in the war be shoot in the mouth or receive other impediment in the same and common a most miserable death for their wicked a custom inclination to that diabolical vice let he by careful to choose to his comrade and fellow old soldier if possible and man well acquaint and of good condition and to by yerie careful that they be no factioner nor who company be more dangerous than the devil he be to by quiet and friendly and rather seveare then licentious in spiche for such like person most common do loose there estimation together with their own quietness and be wont to have many happiecross in this world and to be little repute and hardly can prosper as we daily see in his diet let he not by to couriouse nor incline to delicate meat rather to distribute well his mean and content himself with such provitione as the camp or place shall affourde for those that be give to there belly and to the unsatiable vice of drunkness be apt for nothing and most common be subject to many disgrace whereof their be many example captain of maurish emperor of Constantinopla a prehend and defeat the king of Mosaquio de Salabia and his army who be blind drink with drink to much wine in the selebratinge of a certain sacrifice do for the soul of a brouther of Mosaquio which bienge kill the eveninge before in a certain skirmish and the victorious shoulder have end their figt they fall to eat and drink and for that vice and there little care and be find unprovided and forgetful in a complish there obligation be defeat as many more unsatiable drunkard and glutton have be there contrary suppose afterwards to find they re enemy in the like trap with the like forgetfulness wherein they be find think and consider that they be a small distance of they determine to turn and fall upon they and revenge themselves and release they re king or die in his recoveringe which they agry upon with a resolute determination so that nor none of he shall escape and have it not be for a captain of horse name Gencono who be both prudent and experiment in war command that those under his charge shall in no manner take any liberty in not accomplish with they re military whereof he and his officer take a special care so that at the arivinge of his enemy and determine to fall on with great fury he fall on they with great couradge and constrain they ro retire and turn they re back and with the like or semblable fortune tomire queen of the scythian do overcome king Ciro and his three hundred thousand persian in they re slugish and beastly drunkness who come to revenge the death of Sargapiso her son who be before slay by Ciro and the self same success happen Achab king of Iraell against king benado of Ciria so that trough the inclination which some have to this vice cause great disorder destruction of the co^on wealth and whereof they re be many example not content themselves with the ability of they re poor host where by great scandle do often time arise cause town city and province to revolt from their prinse by result of thigh unsatiable drunkard which un ruly disordere and filthy example be to by well look unto and severe punish the Tirantinos for this vice drive a

with vituale and all other necessary Pesenio niger for take a cock force from they re hosste condemn to death a whole comarade of Souldieres Marques de Pescaro command to cut of the ear of a soldier of he for leave his order in march and for his intent to make spoil in a villadge where he be aprehend the soldier repleeinge to the marquis that he will rather suffer death then receive such a offronte to which the marquis condecend present and command to hang he in the first tree great Tamberlan punish so severlie one of his souldiere for the like or semblable offence that the rigour thereof do so corecte and fear his whole army that where his camp do continue three day to gither a tree full load whith fruit at there departeture remain whole and untouched a mervayllouse example to all to imitate this virtue and abstain from all disorder appetite and patient with great couradge to endure hunger and misery when extreme necessity so require as do the army of Cesar in the seedge of Abarico in France who see the emperor take great grief and compassion of they re hunger for which cause he be determine to retire his camp whereunto they will by no mean condecend pleeinge that first they shall finish they re life by chance of cruel fortune or hunger rather than give overtheyre enterprise and with the like constancy valerouse and noble determination they take in Duraco eat herb and root in the honourable regaininge of Breda by Spinola many example may by give of the necessity of they re and great constancy where ihave see many brave Souldiores compel to extreme and intolerable necessity and neverthelesh woo that they shall rather die in that honourable act then spot they re honour by run a way in such a famous ocation of perpetual memory marquis de Pescora with his own hand kile two souldiere find they forceinge a gentle wooman decend of noble linadge in the sack or tack of Genova let he be careful to by well arm if possible be both honourable and profitable and that beside it lick much his alsoe let he be careful in well a parelinge himself a cordinge to his a bilitie and pay and in no case let he hie not overload with much baggage which be agreate empediment in o of march and special in time of service for we daily see that trough to much baggage the whole army be often time trouble and of the same result many disgrace and sometime be whole lose it import much a honourable soldier to go as light as may be possible without any impediment that shall cause he to be absent from his colour much baggage in o of march cause much trouble and care and special when it be lose as often time happen he be to be careful and vigilant in keep his or watch with great puntualitie and be employ in centery or round let he by very wary in a complish his and special not to fall a sleep for be so find it lie in the disgression of the officer to use he a cordinge his desert as do phirate in Corinto go in the round of that city and find a soldier a ^leepe kill he when other wise the jest affronte he can have be to be in public punish and that for example to the rest that be not wourdie to carry arm for their carelesh mind and little honour let he look well not to refuse his officiere be command in o of his majesty service and be no mean let he not by absent from his guard be on the watch without licence of his officer though he think the place to be peaceable and of no suspicion if he think to go forward or to be prefer in this art he profesh he be to a accomplish with great care and punctuality his that be his care and diligence he may daily hope of better let he consider that our be not captain nor master camp nor that they be bear with thigh office but rather with good part dilgence and good service optain the same honourable let he not marry if he hope to a accomplish well his or to be prefer for in o of march if she go a long with he hardly can he well a accomplish with his if his mean be little and be charge with many child consider whate and how many cross shall happen and he must of force neglect in a complish the of a honourable soldier in the right performance of the king service or forgo his wife and child for he have enough in a complish well with the one and give over the other in the corpse he be to behave himself sober and honest and look well that he fall not unto any quareles for they re he give bad example as alsoe sheow little respect to his majesty service and seem that he neither fear nor respect his officeres wherefore the officer be to punish he for such as be give to quareles in such place be most common account for covarde for it be know that such place be not for quareles nor fight nor by no mean can be permit and so such as be give to quareles in such or semblabel place be a count for covarde and for man of little expectation of theyer valour before they re enemy and ought not to escape without severe punishment he be to be earnest to imitate the good part and carriage of those which raise unto degree by they re prudent and to mark those that be daily declininge ttough their bad and unruly fact little fear God or man of such person little expectation can be of they re furtherance or happy success but rather hate and envy by God and the world so let he always imitate beast in all place in town city or villadge where he be lodge let he by kind and amiable with his host and let he demand for no delicate meat nor regalose as some be inclive unto but rather conform himself with his host for all thing do with amity in thigh be far better and more laudable than rigour and whereof often time result great scandeles disgrace and revolte if it shall chance as some time happen that his patr^o^ or host shall be aman of unreasonable conditione let the soldier then repair to his officer that he may by change into another place or else see his cause remedy better if it be his chance to happen in the expuungnation of any city town or fort let he not be avarition but rather follow and pursue the victory until such time as his contrary be whole yield and licence grant to the spoil and sack wherein he shall sheowe himself neither covetouse nor cruel as many gacelesh Souldiores do who without fear or respect of God or man do spare no kind of cruelty uncomit with bestial ravisment both of maid and woomen wholly to they re bruthis inclination without conscience reason or consideration like wicked and blind man rob of change and monastery build for divine sacrifice whole give to they re disorder filthy a and murther of poor people and inoo^tes yield which rather to the contrary they shall sheowe themselves fearful of God and merciful to the homble vanquise and ra^^er defend they then offend they and in particular the honce^ of as do don Pedro Conde de feria in the expanguation of Du^^ bring all the to the church of that town and defend they from the fury of the emperore people who at that time re-resolved to put all to the sowrde if in battery assault or in countere be shall happen to overcome his enemy let he be of a generouse determination and set all his care in execute the victory and in no wife to attend the spoil nor leave his order as do many now adays like (@) and base factionere to the great dishonour of the action and losh of ^^ly^^lives and of little regard of they re own honour and reputation he be to serve and fight in his prince his cause and deign with afection and constancy and he be not to (@) whether the ^po^e by just or unjuste so that it by not against god true religion but in such o cation he be to look well to his conscience and to be well advise for god cause be to be loocked unto above all thing in all that shall happen or fall out in the course of war and special in travail and adversity he be peri^h^ly to endure and suffer they that thereby his virtue may (@) and (@) know the uncorrupted affection he bear to his prince in accomplish his with a generouse mind and (@) constancy not murmur of his slow payment (@) ^e compel to stand in great need thereof and special let he be most careful not to yield or by any mean give ear to mutiny or which sometime resulte of such case and who end most common be sheamefull death where of there have be toe many example he which inter in to this noble profession of war ought sense the day of his asentasion to serve his prince with great love and loyalty and obey his officeres and willing fight for a just cause for such virtue seem to be a similitude of a generouse mind and true religion as Platon say that love and obedience be sign of a high and generouse mind and he that want the virtue of obedience be un wourdie of this name for cause that trough disobedience result the greatheste disgrace than can happen to a army let he be careful be not murmur nor speak ill of any officer of he nor of any that serve his prince for it seem a bad custom result of little prudence and respect to speak ill of he who he be bind to defend and by who he be to by govern and comound but rather honour and respect he though his virtue and good part be not agreeable to his neverthelesh for be a minister to his prince he be thereunto bind let he by no mean trough his comrade wife nor for any thing that shall give he lawful occasion of discontentement because that of such like inconvenience and disorder appetite result many quareles and scandeles amonghste Souldieres and often kill one another trough the same then for any other o cation neither be he to receive the boy of another without licence so that thereby he may the better acomplish his masteres service in all of march skirmish or assault with the enemy by force of arm all officiere be to by obey and respect for it belong to they or any of they to see all thing well order and special where they re devitione fall not only those of his company or regiment but whosoever of the army be so comodiouse for the king service in such semblable let he not stand upon term not dispute as some do in say do not know you for my officer let he not by ingnorante therein because that the officer may lawful punish he for if otherwise it fall out and that the officer do complain of he to the high he shall by reprehend for his ingnorance for because that at all time and his own officiere can not be present wherefore he be to obey all officeres let he exercise himself in all sort of weapon and of they let he choose the arm whereunto he be most a fected and find more fit for his purpose the pike and coselett a mongste foot man be of most estimation for be the most firmeste to defend and maintain a place be well order and set and special against the fury of horse of manual fiery weapon the musket be of great execution next to the same the caliver both which be to in viron and line the pike in they re due devitione a cordinge as time place and occasion shall require let he practise himself in each sort of weapon to imitate as near as possible the janisaros turcos who be most expert in arm trough they re continual exercise and let he frequent the sword and target and special I will wish our irish to frequent the same for be more incline to this sort of weapon more than a nigh other nation and beside that of all none be more fit for the same nor more resolute this weapon be of great importance in many and special when man close together or to vive or recnoledge a narrow or straight pasadge or place as trench fort battery assault and for other purpose in war and special a bout the cullore or to defend or offend in a narrow place let he always a ply himself with affection to warlike exercice because that virtue exele fortune and it avail he much to read history and to be expert in aritmeticke for it do both revive and perfectionate mane wit there be shall he understand the carriage prudence and valour of brave man and base inclination of bad person the alteration or decay of kingdom and common wealth the brave and prudent conduction and stratagem of battle both win and lose the virtue and valcor of the renoom the shame and infamy of the vile the manner and use of ancient and modern war with the stratagem use both for the one and the other if he happen to be at the siege or take of any strong place or fortress he be diligent to vive the situation the ordere and industry use for the defence thereof and the stratagem use for the wininge of the same consider these aforesaid and many more use in war and that which touch every officer in particular even from a corporal to a captain general to the end he may be perfect in the art he profese that by his virtue he may be advance into great dignity since that this art he profesh be the mother and true foundation of nobility therefore reason it be that it be perfect understand of the and followere thereof see that the practice of mecanicall art do follow the same order and course to come to the cunning of they re craft and that beside that no man can reduce into perfection those thing whereof he be ingnorante and know not the art without much practice and special in this so noble and couriouse art who for the thereof with prudence and authority be require both long and diligent practice and theoric it import he much to be a good swimer which be one of the four quality require in a soldier to be rebuste or strong of body nemble and skilful in arm and obedient thigh be the four quality a foresay require in a soldier thus yove see who many good and honourable part be wish to be in a perfect soldier not learn be heersay nor gain with ease and vain glory but rather in a plienge himself well with affection care diligence valour and practice and special perfect with learning and long exercise in war the second chap. treat of the election and office of a corporal in a company of infantry the office of a corporal be very antciente for in time paste in the make of captain of infantry in they re real patent no officeres be elect with they but and afterwards be elect the office of alferife and in the election of the a foresay Officeres the captain ought to do it with great consideration and to choose those of great virtue and experience to the end he may be the more belove and respeed geevinge they good example and procure to pacify they re quarrel that they may still live in unity and love lick bretherin he be to procure that his squadron be divide into comrade and live together in their lodging and all other place with great conformity and love and if a contraversy shall happen or a rise betwixt they he be to be very earnest to see it pacify without delay and if in case a disordere shall fall out that he can not remedy let he without delay repair to his sardgent Alferis or captain which of they first he can find so that the quarrel may be a comotaded in due time let he be careful to see that they re armour be neat and servisable without a empediment or let that he may be ready with the same all time and let he not trust only to the roll of his squadron but rather learn every name in memory and where each one let he teach and instruct the bisone and raw man who to handle they re arm and by expert in the same to a compilsh with they re king and alsoe for they re one honour utility and defence he be alsoe to by careful to know the quality and condition of each one of his squadron for be employ in convoy or a nigh other separate service whereof he be to give a if in his squadron they re be a disorder fellow and it be alsoe necessary that he know such as be so incline to prevente remedy a ganiste they re unruly disorder appetite a corporal or be employ with his squadron in convoy or a separate watch let none be ingnorante that he be to oversee and correct all disordere commit be in of his majesty service or for any other kind of disorder commit for he be the person that must yield account to his superior of all that be refer to his charge wherefore he be to command resolute such as be commit to his care and charge who they be to obey and observe his ordere in all that he command touch his majeties service and whosoever shall not obey his as a foresay of those under his charge if be fair mean he do not a accomplish let he severe punish he with the sword but in no case main the soldier as some and unconsiderate officeres do but let he always see who he command and a complish the content of the order give he a cordinge as discression time and the occasion shall require and not otherwise Trouh much liberty we daily see resulte many disorderes wherefore obedience must be observe and seaveritie minstre but that with great concideration and equity rather than with raishnes and little prudence for some time some officeres trough they re authority blind and sinister understand do commit fault but the soldier always be bind in obedience to his but nothing the further in optaininge justice all vituale and amunitione that shall be deliver by the sardgentor furiell to the corporal he shall with equality divide and distribute the same betwixt the souldiere of his squadron without any fraud or partiality and procure that they a comodate themselves in all place with amity like true companione and let himself in wourde and deed be careful and love towards they so shall he by the better repute both by his and those that be bisone or raw man he be to be careful in instruct they in handle they re arm and who to serve which the same because he be to instruct he to stand in his centerie and who to a complishe his to have his piece ready charge and prim and to cock his burn match and so to present his piece and who and be a to terciar or charge his pick when the round come let he demand for the word and with so low a voice in receivinge or givenge the same that they may understand one a nother and no high the third chap. treat of the office of Asardgente of a company of infantry in the election of a it be very requisite for his majesty service that the captain choose one of good part and approve suficiencie consist in he the most part of the of military discipline for it be his office to execute the ordere give be his wherefore it import he be not choose by favour nor affection hut rather trough his valour and long experience in war be so choose it be a great repose to his captain and Alferis and all other shall have the better success it import much that he do read and write for many respect otherwise hardly can he well perform his office it import alsoe that he be skilful in martial yea and of so great importance that more tolerable it be that all the other officiere of the company be it the captain himself to be raw man and of little experiencie but the Sardgente not so who of necessity ought to be of approve part great care and punctuality in execute the ordere give by his consist in the suficiencie and care in he require it belong to he the devitione of the squadrone of his company and see that each soldier do serve with his complete arm assent on he in the king list he be to oversee which care and diligence all disordere commit in his company and reprehend factionere and not dismeasure himself in the same but rather with moderation to redresh and a comodate all disorderes and eavell which shall occur in ranckinge and order each sort of weapon there be sundry manner of way for they re devitione but always let he put each sort of weapon by itself touch they re devitione and who they shall be order shall by at large declare in the office of the sardgent mayor let he be always careful in the devition of his pick in put or plasinge in the vanguard retegarde and two flank their best arm corselete and the ensign or culore in the centre but in offer of occasion of frame of a squadron he shall observe the order give be the sardgent mayor show himself with grea^ diligence and care in a complish whate be refer to his charge in so doenge he merit the honour and reputation and do the contrary dishonour and shame whereof result disorderes and loose of much time and cause of great discontentement for not accomplish and observe the ordere give when ocacation offer he be to fight as well as the rest choysinge a convenient place that he may return to his office for it be very necessary that he accomplish the obligation of a prudent careful and vigilant soldier he shall go galantlie with a fair Milan hedpeece and a extraordinary good collet and a halbart or geneton but be reason of his overmuch travel and pain his arm by no mean ought to by heavy for if they be so hardly can he well execute his office with care and diligence he shall execute in due time the ordere give by his not miss any point therein and if at one time two or three several officere give he order let he follow the order give be the high officer if it be not recaul or that he seethe the occasion to be of importance to his majesty service he be to have always about he a list of all the souldiere of his company squadron by squadron alsoe he be to be careful to know where every one lodge and whate comrade be together in each lodge and that for many respect he shall and ought diligent to reprehend and procure to drive out of the company all factionere if they do not a mindd as thief drunkard quarlere and revoltere for they be most discomodiouse for his majesty service beside they do no good butt be rather dangerous for they be mean to learn other their office and most odious kind of life and draw they to imitate there base fact he be to be very careful in all of march and imbattellinge to instruct his souldiere to punctual keep they re rank observe distance and file to handle well and serve with they re arm and to be very vary to instruct such as be ingnorante which for the most part result of the little sufficiency and care of some choose by favour or affection for we see that some souldiere of long time have serve and know not who to handle they re arm nor serve with the same in time of need which resulte of the little regard such person have of they re honour and little hope to by advanced trough they re good part but in thigh and in many more the Sardgente be one that know who to comply well with his duty and office can redress thigh great fault butt oherwise he be unable yove shall find under his charge some souldiere that in come before their enemy when occasion offer they neither know how to handle they re arm nor serve with the same as before speak to prevente thigh and many more fault the captain be vigilant and ought to by in form of every thing in particular of his inferior officeres and he be careful he can prevente each particular and see they redreste in due time so shall he be the more respect and belove be the honourable souldiere of his company and shall with the more resolution fall on his enemy when occasion be offer and alsoe shall manifest his care and affection in his majesty service if he shall of his own motive a prehende any soldier and acquaintinge his captanie there with or any other superior let he in no case put he at liberty but afterwards it apertain to he to procure his liberty by fair mean let he by no mean displace any soldier from his lodge to put a o there in his place for it lie not in his power without licence of his captain for he have no authority to drive one out and to accommodate a other in his place beside it be a ocation of great discontentement except he put he out for disorderes comit betwixt he and his host or comrade for that lodge be give he by the prince and if he be drive out for a unjuste cause and make his complaint to the master camp or colonel he shall give he licence to change his place into a o their company for the wrong do unto he and his captain may by just reprehend for not minister justice he shall permit no soldier to put of his arm enter into the watch till the Alferis first be disarm in garrison the word be not to be give till the gate be shut nor in till the hour appoint be the

that thereby he may by the more honour and affect beside that it be his obligation let he beware not to be cruel nor inviouse to his souldiere which be a token of a bad inclination and nature and of officeres of little virtue if by chance he shall by angry with any soldier of he in turn his back he be to forget that fury and afterwards sheowe himself amiable and love and so they come to the knowledge of his homoure they shall have the more ear not to anger he and if other wise he sheowe himself rigorous and incline to be revenge tbey will run away and he shall fall into disgrace and shall be hate by his captain let he be no mean presume to slashe or cut Souldieres with his swourde exepte upon just in his majesty service and special in dispute of plea or any other particular quarrel of his own in such and semblable let he look well to he self for the soldier in such a particular owe he but little respect or none at all be thereunto constrain for a soldier be to defend his life and honour for which none can blame he be of force thereunto constrain the FOURTHE chap. treat of the election and office of a alferish of a company of infantry the charge and office of a Alferis or Ansign bearer of a company of infantry be to be repute as a captain leftenant in who choysinge his captain be to have many and great for not only such a one ought to by agoo de soldier and of bold and valerouse but to by his equal if it may be both in virtue and discretion because that oftentimes in his absence the of the company do belong to this officer and for as much as the ansigne be the true foundation of the company and that in the same consist the honour both of he and of his souldieres reputasion it be necessary that he unto who this office be commit have in he the a prove part wiss in a brave soldier for the great trust in he repute and that in his captain absence he rule and govern the company and from he the sardgente and be to receive the ordere as they do from they re captain but the Alferis be not to set at liberty any prisoner without consent or licence of his captain or other superior officeres neither be he to give licence to any soldier to leave the company it be necessary to who this so honourable a charge be recomend never to a banden it as many brave fellow have do to they re perpetual fame and glory he ought to go galante and well arm for many respect as in day of battle or in giveng a assault or in march before his king or captain general in of fight with his enemy he be to himself dreadful and terrible with his sowrde in the right hand and his culore in the left brave display the same show himself valiant and givenge good example to the souldiere and animatinge they he be to live and die in defence of the same with a resolute mind and brave determination as do the Alferis of Oloa in the battle give be conde don Gomes and don Pedro de lara for the queen Vraca of Castilia against don Alonso king of Arragon her husband in which they be overcome and the conde slay cutinge of the two hand of this gentleman to quit he of he culore until which time he never yield after which cruel wound he embrace his culore betwixt his arm and as do a Alferis Tudesco in the encounter which king don Fernando de Napoles have with the frence and Dutch with his right hand cut of and the leifte sore wound and find that he can do no more greepte the culore with his tooth and toucke hold at the same till he be slay in garrison the day that he be to enter unto the watch with his company that morning he be to put or display his in his window that it may be see by the souldiere of his company for a true token that that night he shall inter the watch and in set the watch he ought not to disarm himself till the gate be shut nor in campana till the word be give and all thing provide his souldiere ought to imitate he be thereunto bind he give they always good example and he ought to honour and respect his captain and a accomplish his ordere with love and punctuality be thereunto bind for the honour do unto he which his father be captain can do no more for no great honour can he give then referinge to his charge the king culore wherefore the Alferis be to forbear with his captain in many dispute which happen rather than sheowe himself ungrateful as some unconsiderate fellow do the very same will he wish to himself if he come to that dignity and charge he be to make much of the drummere and fife because he may by sure to find they when ocation be offer and that he and the captain shall see they content for fear they run a way concideringe the great need he have of they he be to guard his culore well in all place and tack a special care of the same let it be before they re eye that they may see it for the watch be not a point for his person but for the security of his hardly can they give a of the same except they see it neither do the soldier well a accomplish his obligation except it be so it be necessary that he by a man of good part of good and example for thigh be require in he for in the absence of the captain the of the company a pertain to he for he be to give the ordere and to the sardgent corporal and

his officeres as a foresay before he march with the same he be first to cause the culore to be bless and afterwards deliver the same to the Alferis give he to understand the honour recomend to his charge and that he be always to take a special care of the same and to die in defence thereof as before declare then he be to divide they into squadrone elect and name one squadron for himself of those of best quality and conditione for be so necessary and of emportance for of they most common he be to choice his officeres and consult with they in o of fight and enconteres with the enemy most common they be next his own person respect and honour they as his own person and sometime they be employ for cavose or of some brave exploit it emport alsoe that in the o their squadrone there by some particular sovildiere and a ventajado he be to procure that all by good cristianes and of a good and life to here mass and often confess for be the true fundasion of happiness he be to a comodate all disorderes quarrel and dispute that shall happen amongst they and reprehend those of bad example and dishonest behaviour and if by fair mean they do not a mind to drive they a way for factionere and infamous fellow be not to be permit to a company the king culore nor to equal themselves with the of the noble art of war in o of march with his company let he procure not to be trouble with much baggage and special to use such moderation in not permitenge that his souldiere be overload with lugadge or traish as some time happen butt rather to go as light as may by possible with only they re armour and o there little inescusall necessary that thereby they may with the lesser empediment manage they re arm and fight with the more resolution in offering o cation in each company of infantry it be necessary their shall be a feowe horse permit to some officeres and particular person but not many these horse do serve for many purpose and special to recnoledge passage and place where the enemy may be suspect to be in ambuscado which for such be very requisite as alsoe to send warn of sudden o of importance he be not to a tempt of little a peeranee faringe it shall fall out unhappy except he be constrain thereunto of necessity for such as do not prevente and forecast they re success in time be wont when the o cation offer to by much trouble yea and some time out of they re wit he be to by careful in a complish and observe the ordere give he by the officer mayore when manifest of cation do not offer that the a complish of such ordere shall be hurtful it be very necessary he know each soldier of his company by his name and in o of march that he procure and see that they still observe they re order and rank and not to permit they to straggle hire and there for be very necessary for many because that great scandeles do arise trough the over much liberty of straglere in spoil garden orchard and the house of the inhabitant or country where they march whereof resulte great discord and discontentment to the inhabitant for the losh they receive of some unruly campanione in the redresinge whereof the captain be to be very careful and not to permit they to by rigerouse with they re host for they re meal butt rather content they whith whate he can give and see those that do not observe thigh ordere severe punish for be the obligation of a good Christian and vertuese soldier if o their wise he do hardly can he escape scandale and bad reputasion and beside if it come to the general be ear he and his officere be in danger of reprehension yea and often time see they re soldier hang before they re face for they re spoil don upon the poor innocent people wherefore they re have be many punishment execute for such and semblable disordere Julius Caesar pass from Cicilia to Africa against and king Juda de Numidia have leave in that island the minthe and ten legion and afterwards when he send for they be inform of the captain and o their officeres in permitinge they re souldiere to spoil the country without minister any good discipline command that they shall by bring in presence of the whole army reprehend they re bad government present command they to by banish out of the army and yvithoute any delay to embarck out of all Africa the lick punishment do duck de Alva in the war of Portugal reform so many captain for theyre and they re soldier

soldier be execute to death by justice for their disordere then kill or dead o there wise in that war disorderly shall he govern in war wiche never be practise in the art wherefore it be very necessary that man choose for this office shall wourdy pass trough all the degry before speak of or at jest part of they to the end he may the better know how to govern and command and particular that he be always mindful to fear God and to be virtuous and experiment in martial affair in many can thigh good part be have and many more and in such as they can be whole find let they re choice be make of those of who the most be to by find because that it import much the king service for all observation of military discipline if he be command with his company and o their troop join to they as often time do happen to the guard or defence of a place let he with great care vigilance and valeor animate his souldiere and consulthe with his officeres and best experiment souldiere and be resolve let he with all care and speed fortify and intrince himself as many brave and valiant captain have do show themselves with prudence valeor and brave conduction present themselves in all of the first with a brave and resolute determination but let he by very vary that he a tempt nothing inconsiderate and as often time happen to ingnorant man of little experience to they re own and company confusion to a void such enconvenience and hazard let he be very careful to a accomplish and observe the ordere and give by the high comaunderes if o cation do not offer whereof great domadge may ensue or a good o cation to by lose in which captain be some time of force to prudent prevente the best let he never deny a honourable enterprise be command thereunto be the general or governor though he find it a journey of great danger but he be to present his reason if he find o cation necessary and so fall on with a valerouse determination he shall with a generouse mind and good wourke procure to win the good will of his souldiere a continge they as his son and child and that by such fair mean in not sheow he self over coveteouse and greedy but rather liberal still secoringe his souldiere to his ability in they re necessity and want and not to base wrong they in rob or deceivinge they of they re pay as some captain be wont to do with little honesty or fear of God make a common practice thereof trough which they win bad fame and teach and repute by they re high unwourdie of the name of a captain and often time be severe punish for the same and deprive of they re company with a just sentence he be to be very careful to visit the centery and corpse guard under his charge show great diligence care and punctuality in his own person that the officeres and Souldieres do imitate he and precise a accomplish with they re a cordinge the ordere give by the high and be he let he be careful that his souldiere be not give to vice and to much liberty trough there own negligence and bad a all fin fall into bad custom for in permittenge thigh unruly fact without necessary redress he offend God and his king for they be under his charge as his family he be to cause every one of they to confess at jest once in ayeare and special in all time and o of danger of death as befit a good Christian to do it be very necessary to have a good furiell a ble in aritmeticke as also in read and write and to be one of trust and well acquaint for the lift and reconinge of the company most common be refer to his charge as well to pass muster of his company as in distribute arm and a apparel which be give be the king to the souldiere of which he be to yield a when it be seek for by the prince be minister to who charge the same a pertain to thigh furielle or clerk do a pertain to receive the ordere for the make of quarteres in town viladge and from the furiell mayor as shall be ordain and a point by he and most common the distributinge and devidinge of the quartere be refer to the charge of the it hapen some time that the furiell do march with his company alone from one place to a nother may be of reasonable distance carienge with he his patent or order for the same go for the most part before the company to cause the quarter to be make att they re a rivenge in such the captain be to be very careful that thigh person do not commit great fault as some time happen trough the covetousenes of such person result often time trouble to his captain for rob and steal not only in the way butt alsoe in the villadge where they do lodge spoil the same and give of cation to the inbitane to run away which disorderes so commit do often time come to the high comaunderes ear and chardinge all upon the captain be honeor and reputasion and the factionere run away for fear of punishment and sometime thigh furielle or clearcke in meet a good fellow do fall a drink and make good cheer and his charge not finish nor find he nor know where to be find yea and often time for a piece of money leave the company trust to small commodity and it may by in o of most necessity be weary and wet to the skin think to stop they re mouth with envented fable and lie for which disorder the captain as a father of his souldiere be to see he severe punish be thereunto bind for the discharge of his conicience and reputation it be very necessary for the captain and company to have a good Chaplain reasonable learned and special virtuous and of good life and example but not a friar except it be with licence of his above all o the art of war be of most danger so the soldier be to be very earnest to be devote and of clear conscience for he be more near dangere of death than any o their sort of man and it be necessary that he always have a priest not far of for the soul health to who he may confess at all time and o a cordinge as time and necessity shall require in the choisinge and keep of thigh priest the captain in conscience be bind to procure that they be virtuous and of good life if o therwise it be far better not to have any at all he be of necessity to have a barber in his company and if it be possible of good skill in this art for be a very necessary instrument in war for when a soldier be hurt the great comfort he can have be a good barber that shall cure he well and with speed for if he depend to be cure by another which at all time be not to be have except he send for he may by a far of hardly can he be well cure and beside he be in danger of death if the wound or hurt be dangerous he be both in danger and trouble this be such a necessary instrument in war and because that Souldieres be man of liberty they fall often time into many disgrace except they re officere have a special care to prevente the necessary remedy for which and for many more dangere they incur it be very necessary they have a good barber as before speak and if his pay be not able to entertain he with instrument and o their necessary the officeres and Souldieres be to further and asiste he that he may the better and with a more will mind serve they and a accomplish with the more punctuality his in o of march with his company the captain and other officere be to by very earnest that they re souldiere do not dismaunde out of their order and rank as many unruly factionere do little regard they re captain honeor nor they re own reputation as before declare and at his depart out of any town or viladge where he shall lodge though it be but for one night he be to see all disordere commit redress not opresinge nor a beedinge injury do to the poor innocent inhabitant but rather stay after the company till they be clear out of the town or villadge give order to the Alferis to march to the a point place or distance where he be a point to make or stand and alsoe give order to the sardgente to charge the baggage with speed have so do he himself be to visit over the quarter and see if there be any complaint and to see they remedy before the company do depart have finish well with his obligation and desire herein it be necessary he carry with he in write from the of that town or villadge that they be satisfy with the good minister be the captain in not permitinge injury nor disordere without redress and satisfaction have accomplish with thigh he be to repair to his company call the corporal that he may know and be well a sure if any body want or no and then he give order that the baggage do march in they re due place as time and o cation shall require and the same still acompany with a guard if the country be peaceable and of no fear of the enemy he may well command the baggage to march in the vanguard and if o therwise let they march in the rergarde or battle acording as he shall suspect of fear both in the vanguard and rearguard command the Alferis to lead the company and the captain to stay in the rearguard and the sardgent to and fro all a longste the flank of the company so shall they orderly march keep they re rank and do little spoil and disorderes let he cause that they march still in good order give wareninge to the sardgente to be very vary and vigilant in (...) the same so shall he instruct and persuade his souldiere to be apt and ready to good and dissaude from unruly and bad reprehend fault and disordere and commend valour virtue and obedience that therbey they may be ready and apt to all incounteres and which shall or may happen and endure they by fair mean to endure patient all toil discomodity and want so that they arise not into mutiny trough there impatience bad inclination and which some time happen for want of good and little care of some captain in give good and example let he be careful that no soldier of his company play nor pane his arm nor apparel for he which be give to such vice seem to be of little shame and of less honour wherefore such unruly fellow ought to be severe punish for there villainy and bad example some time it happen a captain with his company to be employ in secret service of importance or may by with part of his company and some sovildiere that be give to learn hire and they re of neowe do burst with desire to know where he shall go in such the captain ought to by severe and not to permit any soldier to treat or demand where he be bind for it be a dangerous word result of little prudence and beside he offend much for in thigh and semblable exploicte there be great mystery wherefore the captain be to himself rigorous to whosoever shall presume to intermiddell in any such fulish and dangerous demand and pardon none that shall intermiddell in the same for example to the rest happy be those that be considerate scilente and obedient and do not intermiddell in thing out of sense and not apertain to they for common of such souldiere be great in time of need hope all good corespondance of their good life example and carriage wherefore such be still first prefer and of most estimation which by all reason ought so to by if a captain be careful that his officere do well acomplis they re duty and he be to procure that they be person that can read and write for be most necessary for o there wise they be unable he can hardly trust to write to they and special any thing of emportance touch his majesty service for of force such must pass trough the hand and understand of of they where hardly he can trust unto no sort of man or be more bind or more in need in know to read and write then the officeres and of the souldiere for often time mattere of great quality secret and importance to they re king be recomend to their care and charge who require more secrecy than advertissemente or affair merchant or any other tradesman whatesoever so that this officer may be repute unable to full acomplish his and he may well say that he owe butt little to his father for not instruct or learning he be so great a fault and special in this profession the six chap. treat of the election and office of a sardgent mayor enter with his regiment to garrison the election of the sardgente mayor of a regiment be to be choysen and elect of such as the master camp or colonel do name or put in election to the general in this election great consideration ought to be take and be no mean the general be to give way or entrance to favour nor affection but rather to virtue valour and sufficiency for cause that this office be of such emportance to his majesty service and be a general minister of a whole regiment of many company and of all the of the same be who prudence and industry the master camp or colonel do give convenient ordere for the due of his

and office of such importance we read that in time past the of the roman and of o trust the execution of this office to none but the general themselves administer the same concideringe that in day of battle the beauty and force thereof consist in the well order and frame of the same be which the victory most common be win for undeniable it be that those that be best order and exercise in war be mastere of the victory though they be lesser in number where of they re have be to many example of ancient and brave and all a firminge the same as do a peer in the last and famous journey in which Hannibal Carthagenense be overkome by Scipio africano not with stand Hannibal have to his judgement prevent and order all thing as necessary and fit neverthe less the sagacity and prudence of Scipio be at that day so great that it be enough to put they all to flight with his singular and extraordinary military prudence amongst the frence and Dutche this office be more esteem then in o their place wherefore it shall be always commend to the charge of the more prudent experiment captain that can be have in the regiment and together with this office they have company so that they have the name of

some time it fall out recomend to unable bisone of little service and less sufficiency whereof result to many inconvenience and because that in they do not of cur the approve and prudent part and authority require for execute well this office captain of the regiment do give they some time but little respect or credit for this election be all equity and justice and for many of importance ought to be earnest seek a soldier of the best o pinion and sufficiency that amongst the whole regiment can be have and that he be very perfect in arithmetic for be the most necessary point for the of this office after have exercise much in the war and not elect be no mean by favour for be a office who require much ability very many can be find who have spend they re time in the war who be not fit for this charge rather by trial and examination make of his a prove sufficiency as with in winenge they re chair of dignity be trial of their a prove part and sufficiency and he who in his examine represent he with authority in give the best reason be first prefer for by thigh mean douptless souldiere shall be the more will to study to by perfect for the optaininge of this so honourable a

that by they re good and diligent they may be the soon prefer and honour this office be of their wise give the king and o cation be offend for some to discharge themselves in this office do trust to

so that they pass captain in mean and degree at this present and the o cation of murmur and equality betwixt they and the captain be set a side which of right ought so to by and by they the order of the general and master camp be give to the captain and there executipnes accord accomplish for to a accomplish well with the extraordinary care and travail of this office it be very necessary that he

outward part and see if they re by any fit place for ambuscadose for the enemy of hedge wood or garden and prevent it with all diligence and all necessary endustrie so that the enemy may not prevail in take any advantadge as often time it fale out in the morning at the open of the gate to prevente this he be at the open of the gate to command four or five light to revewe the camp without the gate for the better security and the rest of the guard in the mean time with they re arm in they re hand and not to whole open the gate till thigh return give they order to visit and revewe well all the circuid on the outerwarde side some 300. pace more or less till he see that they re be no suspicion and if they speethe enemy they be all to shoot and the cinterie above the gate shall present the guard or watch and when otherwise he see that they do not the enemy the gate may by open by order of the officer that they re comaunde and then shall he cause the centery to be set on the gate and bridge as occasion may be suspect not fail to be very vary and careful in previntinge whate may ensue or misshapen and special to be careful that the souldiere do not absent themselves from they re watch and for fear of stratagem of treason it be very necessary that in each port or gate where any suspicion may be fear that they re by two long sharp yrone like spit which shall serve to pass trough from side to side wagones of hay and straw for fear that any man may by secret hide in they and to let no man arm pass into the town without order and special if it by a frontier or place to by fear much of the enemy at the shutinge of the gate the officer and Souldieres there a point to guard shall by all in arm till the same be shut and the officer of the watch shall look well that the gate be well shut all be so accomplish the officer shall send the souldiere he think fit to convoy the keaye to the governor or chief comaunderes lodge the baggage of the whole regiment interinge to garrison be to march in the rergarde with a company of Souldieres guardinge the same and the sardgent mayor and a judante be to go still a horsebake till all thing by well order and provide until such time they see that all by lodge for in the biginenge of such partisione most common be many and dispute which ought with all care and haste to by redreste in which the sardgent mayor be to command with resolute authority in ordaininge all thingss to by pacify and redreste minister justice and equity not admitenge any disorder without due redress cause his ordere without repleee to be execute with obedience if otherwise it by not accomplish as he first ordain his can not well prosper but let he before hand look that his ordere by prudent give so that with this resolution he shall well a accomplish all and shall be repute and respect for a man who know who to govern and command with prudence and authority and shall be both respect and fear by the souldiere when any or proclamation be to be give he be to procure with the master camp that it be put in writenge upon the corpe that the ordere may be observe and the better understand be all after the proclamation be make and that none may by ingnorante in understand the penalty in the same mention and the acordinglie make for if otherwise not execute it be far better not to set it four but in thigh consideration be to by use acording as the occasion shall require after true information by take of the case all officere in war be bring into good perfection with prudence care and templance rather than show himself rigourouse and licentious in speech with a furious countenance be not thereunto constrain for the soldier feel no punisment almost so grivouse as this which seem to he to resulte trough ingnorance and envy and of all the rest of the officeres this bad custom be more odious in the sardgent mayor be the master of who they shall by right learn good example and and in who by reason the befittinge part thereunto necessary shall acurr be a minister to see fault redreste such officeres as do sheowe themselves with a furious and odious countenance do opress they re condition which do not resulte of a generouse mind and most common they be hate but such as sheowe themselves with a prudent carriage and amiable be much esteem obey honour and respect by the souldiere and do bind they in and repose of mind but for one contrary another contrary that if in case the soldier do not acomplish his as he be bind to do and in do the contrary in comitinge disordere it be necessary to punish he severe yea and so far that it may into his heart if by fair mean he do not a mind some officeres of carriage and amiable behaviour do only with a groomely countenance and good reason because they re souldiere to tremble and fear they without any o their rigour and the souldiere know of their officer good inclination do both obey love and fear they find by experience that he lovethe they and assist in time of most necessity and need show they good example and give they good and know that he have no rancour envy nor revenge in his heart but rather to couradge they in all necessity and equallinge himself with they in all dangere and travail and to be incline to redress they re want in this case they both love and fear he and endure all dangere and necessity with he and do follow he in all peril with a will mind so that nothing do more content a honourable soldier than a love officer have in he the part and quality before declare the sardgente mayor be to give order that if the round do here any rumour or stir in the town or any other place that he with speed the next a djoininge guard and that he by no mean give over his round but continual with care and vigilance visit till his time by expire and the corpe or watch to who he give intelligence be bind with great speed to repair to a comodate the occasion as alsoe to give intelligence to the superior officeres if the occasion be of such importance he be alsoe to give order to the officeres of his regiment that they have a special care that they re souldiere do not lend arm one to a nother for to inter the guard for it be a bad custom of which resulte no good for often time a musketeer dare his musket to one that shall carry a pike and if in that night do offer occasion of a a alarm both be discomodiouselie provide and beside when the Musketier be restore of his musket and interinge with the same into the watch not remember that he it shoot it free think that they re be no bullet as he charge the same and the other to who it be leave a bullet in it he shoot think no ill and kill one of those before he which often time happen yea and sometime be on the watch often time the one carry the muskett or caliver of his fellow and put a bullet into the same the other think of no such matter fry shoot and alsoe kill another this bad sinister and dangerous custom ought to by prevent and to severe punish the soldier that do lend his arm for a remedy of thigh ingnorante careless and inconsiderate fault all prudent and skilful souldiere ought to be very vary to prevente and discharge thigh dangerous charge before they inter into the watch some base companione and covarde day of feast do charge they re piece with bullet and kill with envy and revenge who please they wherefore a straight order ought to by give to all that they shall be very vary and in pain of death no soldier shall be find in such a act most necessary it be for a sardgent mayor to be careful to exercise his souldiere in manadginge of they re arm and in know how to serve with the same as alsoe how to observe they re order in march and squadron and fall without confusion into they re just place in battle a ray all which the sardgente mayor be bind to instruct for be the master who be to learn and lead they for it belong to his charge and office and beside it import he much that they be well instruct and exercise in martial affair for so with great facility shall he execute his affair as do the Thesarios to who charge be the romany be recomend this office as well in fill as in garrison they instruct they re souldiere in the school they exercise the which be the bisone or new souldiere two time a day and the which be they re old soldier once a day so they be very expert as well in know how to manage they re arm as to serve with the same as alsoe in punctualy know to observe order in march and squadron as alsoe induringe great travail they alsoe be exercise in runinge leapinge shewminge and all other exercicee and virtue necessary and fitenge for war they be constrain to march with they re complete armour both foot and those that go a horssbake two day in a month carienge alsoe with they on they re back all necessary food for that jurney fight as it be with the enemy givenge and receivinge the charge as if it be in a bloody war for the space of ten thousand pase in they re whole yurney come and go and with this as custom exercise they be apt and nemble whensoever occasion of service or employment do offer so that with two thousand of these great exploit and be make then with thirty thousand bisone or raw man for which cause they be victorious councoringe with great renoome till they be whole give to vice idleness and regality trough which mean they begone to fall into decay and of they re long repose and idle life do resulte a bad and sorrowful end for be whole give to delicate meat sleeepe and ease and of no care to exercise themselves in arm they become to forget all virtue to by covarde and fall into decay now see a plain example which happen to one of the most famouseste captain of the world which be Anibal Cartagenes son to Amilcar be nine year old be bring to the war and be cause to swear to be enemy to the roman during life and come to the adge to govern a army he march from Spain trough France into Italy where in pass the river Rodane the roman a tend he where he have a most sore encounter in pase the river but aniball with prudence and great valeure with table tember and great try make a bridge trough with difficulty and great hazard that at lenghte he paste his army over the river by force of arm and with no lesh endustrie do he pass the huge montaine of the Alpes break down great and make they plain where he make a way that his army can pass which contain 120000. of foot and horse and they re baggage on elefante and brute beast and pase to piamonte where he rejoyse of his safe a rival trough such a trouble some and dangerous way comfort and give he to understand that they be out of danger and trouble and arrive into a fertile country of all necessary befittinge there have repose his army he touke his jurney towards the river of Trevia in Plasintin and meet with the roman where he optain the victory and from thence he touke his jurney and paste by Perusa till he come to Trasimeno where he give a other overtrow to the roman and kilth of they three and twenty thousand and after this he paste with his army to pulla in canas which now be Barleta where he alsoe fight with the roman and have the victory of they with the slaughter of forty thousand of they as Plinius and Francisco Petrarca Tuscano declare so that he have the bridle with Italy sixtime year poseste with that brave and prudent conductor skilful and valerouse army after this he come to Capua a pleasant country of woman and other comodity and they re give himself and his army to repose in garisone a long time where he and they become idle and forgetful of all military exercise as though they never have manage arm which be cause of the ruin and perdition of all his army as they say that Capua be a great perdition to Anibal then to the roman the losh of canas and after be constrain to pass unto Africa to soucour his country be inform that that famous captain thite with his roman army be who aniball be overcome so that his vice long repose and neglect of arm be cause of his destruction as alsoe happen to many other brave warriere but this of Aniball be a sufficient example for those that follow the profession of arm to always hold and keep they re souldiere in exercise of arm and that with great care for fear of destruction so this be a good and sufficient example for a sardgent mayor to always keep his souldiere in the exercise of arm and to imitate still the roman in they re continual practice and in case that the most part of the company of his regiment be not together where he be resident let he they re captain that they be careful to exercise they re souldiere and it be not amiss that he in the end of every three or four shall visit they all over and with care exercise they in the of march and imbatelinge whereby he shall find they apt and ready to he will not needinge overmuch pain nor dispute as always must by with raw man little exercice in arm in nothing be he to be more curious then in learning and instruct they who to observe ordere of march and in frame with they all sort of squadrone and to cause they skirmish sundry manner of way and cause they to toss the pike and to by apt in handle the same be queen of arm and most noble of all the rest this office of a sardgent mayor be in time paste call thesariouse or master who be to instruct military discipline he which be apt and skilful in well a complish the approve part ordain for the execution of this office be fit for any other office in war to the very office of a master camp general which of all the rest require greatesth care and sufficiency wheresoever the sardgente mayor shall happen to by with his regiment or with part of the same either in or garrison when the company of the same shall inter the watch he be to by present and take care that the captain be well arm with fair and complete corselete and all piece thereunto a pertaininge and with a fair peek of sixtine or seventine foot long the musketeer with a complete good muskett and that by no mean it by permit to cut any piece of the barrel as some do to lighten it and such as be find gilthie in this so great a fault ought to by severlie punish they be to be provide with good flask and with fair and strong cord and hurquillo of six foot with they re yrone on both end as behoove and the be to be provide with good of a strong and sure barrel fit to receive a bullet of a once or very little less and a fair frask fraskillo and cordone the measure of the powder ^all by at jest a half once or rather more he be never to want a bag of leader with twenty five bullet and a iron to strike fire at all time when occasion shall require for oftentimes be in centery and other place his match be quite go out and then if he can get no fire his powder be to no purpose at that instant if occasion often some be wont to carry head piece which in many be good but that they be to much trouble some in long marchinge both the musketieres and Arcabuseres shall know how to make match for sometime it hapen that they re be no munition and then be it very necessary that the soldier know to make match for hardly can he ever fail to get flax but otherwise the soldier be un expert and know not to shift and alsoe failenge ammunition they incur great danger so that the soldier ought always to procure with great care to by couriouse and expert in all thing that apartain to his obligation for it may well fall out that he shall march in a country ingnorante in war where no match nor ammunition be make wherefore the brave and careful soldier be to think always before hand to prevente whate may in sue after so shall he be not flute at but rather much recomend for know who with care and prudence to acomplish his obligation which shall give great contentment to his captain and rest Officceres fiery weapon without they re full necessary be of no service wherefore the prudent careful and honourable soldier ought to prevente in due time whate he be bind unto in as much as may by possible so shall he be high esteem by his captain and officeres if the king or prince will fain take a veowe of the whole army regiment be regiment and alsoe the standarte of horse one after a other to pass before he as do the spanish army before king Philip the 2 and the queen Dona Anna in the plain of Cantillana near to badajoe where the whole army do pass before they and so near that they plain vive the visage of every one of they as they paste by as well of the horse which do first pass and afterwards the infantry the first that do pass be the regiment of Lombardie which don Pedro sotemayor do lead a rivenge right against the place where his majesty stand do with grace and speed his pike turn his face right ^o his majesty and make great reverence as to such a place of so ^^gh dignity a pertain and have accomplish his duty and obligation without stiringe do shoulder his pike and march in his jurney in the very same place the first rank of pike that do arrive observe the self same order and in the self same manner do all the other rank of pike pass with he at this time be duke Alva present and the prior don Fernando necessary it be for a sardgent mayor to carry still about he a table book or book of memory for hardly can be conceive and hold all thinhe in memory and whate he writhe be sure of o ne the captain general master camp general be he to receive the wourde of governore and other person the ajudante be wont to receive the watch word and other ordere or the sardgente that be on the watch in absence of the ajudantes which at all time they can not be presenre and special in garrison the sardgente mayor as a general procurer of his regiment aught to solicit and procure that the corpse garites or centerie house be well provide and the corpse with a place make of table or plank whereon the souldiere may sleep and this to be a foot and half above ground and to see t^at they re by a conveniente place where the fiery arm be set and alsoe for the pike he be to procure with the town man that they acomodate the way of the round and that the garita be well acomodate that the soldier may keep himself and arm dry that be no mean he be gridy inconsiderate or covetouse neither permit or give care to any but that the guard by well provide of fire and light for some province be extraordinary and excessive can where we see many souldiere not well a parrele that after accomplish they re duty and stand they re post some three or four hour more or lesh they come bake frissd full of snow and when they re be no fire to comfort they they die in conclusion there officeres and special the sardgente mayor be to by weary earnest in solicitenge this particular for in want this commodity of fire and of which some time the prince and some time they re captain do provide they if ohterwise it be impossible for the soldier to escape to frise for we see those well a parel perish for can this and many more of importance can prudent and brave captain remedy to they re great renoome and that beside they sheowe they re affection to his majesty service if they re can not prosper in this nor they re ability reach in remedienge the same they discharde their conscience and honour when they in devor with care and diligence to pity they re souldiere in earnest procure for they whereunto they be bind if in garrison occasion require as most common it do to provide a round to visit all over if possible it be necessary that a officer or person of respect by appoint for of the same and that officer or only do carry the watch word for be necessary if occasion shall by offer that they shall be constrain to come to the wall to learn what the occasion be or to pass trough the post that be betwixt they and the wall or to pass by the post of the corpse if occasion shall present it be necessary that the ouward centery which be not under defence nor sure security that the watch wourde be not give they and if by change such post shall be ingnorance or negligence permit to pass in ward any man let he not come to the court without a officer first to receive he and inform of his cause these round be to go very silent and secret without any rumour and that they enter in no conversation nor other place butt rather with great care and vigilance acomplish they re order and still go forward in visitenge the magasenes or store house church and church yard empty great house or any other place where suspicion may be fear of joyninge and mutiny and he heeringe or understand of any rumour or join and be thereof well inform and assure he be to aquainte with great speed the sardgent mayor with one or two as the officer shall think fit and he shall continue in that place till the sardgent mayor send he order or come himself in person in the mean time the round be to by very vigilant and these round most common have one third part of muskete and and if they re be any suspicion they be rather to go strong then weak to prevente the empetue of the enemy in warlike affair and exercice all comaunderes ought continual to be vigilant vary careful and fearful in not trust to many for we see that in many place that town and city do revolt when lesh suspicion be of they so that often time in trust be treason therefore the of the noble art of war be bind in all place to be vary and vigilante and continual fear of sudden improvided disgrace continual exercise and practice in war be of great importance wherefore the sardgent mayor be in garrison or else where be never to permit the company under his charge betwixt watch and watch to sleep at home above three night for so the souldiere shall by the more apt to endure when occasion shall present for douptles continual use and exercise help much to compass and ease whosoever shall be incline to commit disordere and give bad example in the corpse guard ought to by severe punish for such place be to be respect for real house and he who without honour discipline and shame do commit disordere in a place of such great respect ought not to escape without due punishment the sardgent mayor be to the captain of his regiment not to give licence to any of they re souldiere to pass unto a other regiment nor out of the country by no mean because that it do not lie in his authority neither to give he leave without be firm of the master camp or governor that shall command who shall appoint the day fit to a complishe his jurney and affair and in the Vedoria general no souldiere place ought to be change unto another company without licence of his captain or master camp for some unruly factionere be desirous to have liberty to run the country to commit disordere and neglect they re duty and spoil the country deceavinge the king and dishonoringe they re nation and daily provookinge othere to that base kind of life of no honour fear nor shame whosoever shall a send his place amonghste the infantry and who enter in rank with the of true discipline ought not to be tolerate to lay hand in any mecanicall trade for it be not fit that such a one shall equal himself with honourable souldiere of noble and vertuese life day of solme feast kermish or fayere the sardgent mayor be to reforce the guard or watch for in such time great congregation of people of other place be wont to join and at such time may happen tumolte and revolte find the man of arm unwary

when the sardgent mayor seat the watch he or one of his a judante be to ride a horseback and visit all the guard and rampar to see if each guard be provide with the man appoint for some time trough

contain in each company and bring the same to the master camp to know the full number of the muster of the company of his regiment whereof the sardgent mayor be to have a copy for many respect a sardgente mayor who will with prudence and authority have his office well execute it be very necessary that he know the quality and conditione of each captain of his regiment that he may employ each one with discretion as time and occasion shall require consider the part and suficiencie of each one that thereby he may employ each one acording to the part that in he do of cur when his captain general or master camp general or ordinary master camp give order for any execution of emportance some be good for all which be esteem for perfect Souldieres some to fight with a valerouse determination other though valiant of unhappy proceed and that result for the most part of they re little prudence some othere do o bey and careful acomplish with whate they be command by they re of which often time happy proceed do resulte othere with prudence valour authority and brave conduction it be most necessary that the sardgente mayor do know the one and the other that he may with the more security employ each one acording as the emportance require of each execution he be alsoe to know the quality and condition of the inferior officeres who be to assist and who be to by employ acording to the part and sufficiency in they he be to present himself with authority and brave resolution fault and disordere with discretion which shall oblige they to obey and acomplish they re with love he be to instruct they and sheowe they good example as well in the exercise of their arm as in accomplish they re with punctuality he be to command with prudence and great resolution for be so most require for the of his office but with prudent consideration for which it be require that he be of a sober and gentle mind for o therwise hardly can he bring to pass his obligation in this and

nor permit none come near he without first give the word though it be his captain or master camp and the soldier that otherwise permitethe any to pass be to be reprehend for ocation may be invent at night of great emportance and so it be very necessary that none be permit to come near the centerie without first give the wourde and that for many respect yea and if it be his officer presume that he know he and entreat and repleeinge to let he pass he be to answer with aresolute determination and say I know none but he that give the wourde for so do he well acomplish his obligation in garrison he shall command the manner and who the round shall be distribute which be the most and sureste security of the place and when he himself shall round by night time to discover redress and reprehend the

re jurney not attend the outward as the inward side of the brickwall he be to severe reprehend they for the more security of a place depend on the care and prudence of the round alsoe if he find the centery negligent and careless in not accomplish their obligation let he see they severe punish that thereby it may be a exemple both for they and othere to accomplish with great vigilance and care they re some sardgent mayore for they re better security do carry at night a target because that often time unruly factionere do pass at night and comittt many disgrace so it be not amiss he go well provide to prevente they re unruly tach inclinasione he be to use great discretion and moderation with the cintery in goenge the round the ajudante be to round alsoe now and then to second the sardgente mayor in different night as ordain by the sardgent mayor imitatenge the step and order of his master and he be to inform of the cintery if they hear any rumour or ocation either without or

officeres of the watch be alsoe to asiste in visitenge the cintery as ordain by the sardgent mayor and that with silence and vigilance demand the cintery if they have hear any thing so that remedy may be prevent in due time if ocation require and special the corporal in give each soldier to understande who he shall handle or manage his arm and who he be to take the word and to be alerto let he not be give nor much credible to uncertain shadow as many bisone and raw man do givenge many alarm without o cation and when the round a proch the cintery be to terciar his pike and demand and if he hould his peace let he turn again in demand with much severity with a angry and furious countenance if he answer which be to say afrende then let he demand the watch wourde prepare and make ready himself for that purpose and if it be so that he shall suspect of the round that it be a enemy though they give the wourde let they not pass aleadginge that they have not the right wourde but otherwise know the round and give the wourde he be to let they free pass the cintery be always to by most careful and Vigilante for some time it may happen that the enemy shall steal the word and fall of a sudden on the cinterie and kill he wherefore he be always to by alerto and very vary and if he suspect the round to be a enemy as before speak let he be no mean come near to master his arm and special if they replee let he cause they to retire if not present he be to call alarm with great fury and high voice that he may by well hear and if need require let he by a little and little retire defend himself the best he may be thereunto constrain but not otherwise wheresoever the sardgent mayor shall asiste with his regiment or part thereof he shall command the common table ordain for gamesteres to be put on the principal court and the of thigh gamestere he shall a point one to oversee the same which shall be to sheowe his horse he be not to permit to put this table in other place nor permit any joyinge of gamestere out of that a point place for many respect and special to avoid quareles dispute joyninge and of some that be give to thigh vicee but rather in the corpe as a place of respect and where each one shall not presume so much to commit disordere for know of the severe punishment for such as commit and loose respect to a place of so great privilege the SEAVENTE chap. treat of the election and office of a sardgente mayor march in the election of the sardgent mayor most common be make by the general of such as the coronelle or Masteres camp do name or give in relation his office be to by a general minister of a whole regiment of sundry company and a of all the of the same by whouse prudence and brave conduction the colonel or master camp do give he the ordere necessary for the due of his regiment in march order and embattellinge of the same and of such matere hereunto a pertain be who a prove good part may be gather the brave conduction valour and prudence require in a perfect soldier be choose as a man who have the be fit part require for this office of such great emportance which in time of the greek and roman be trust to none but the general execute the same in there one person for many rare respect of importance the first thing that he be to do before he begin to march be to consult with his master de camp of all necessary thing for his jurney and see such thing befitinge prevent and provide in due time advertise all the captain of his regiment to put themselves in order to march with as little baggage as may be possible and within so many day to have all thing in areadines and givenge order to the captain to prepare himself and his sutlere as alsoe to the auditor furiell mayor surdgent mayor drum mayor and that he be careful that drum and fife by well provide in each company the office of a sardgent mayor be of high degree than any ordinary captain for the captain do receive the ordere from he and follow this and the sardgente mayor from the colonel master camp or general or from the king or emperor himself if he be in the field for he be bar no entry gate nor other place but free sufer to pass into the king or emperor be chamber for be a person of great respect and fidelity wherefore they re aught great concideration and regard to be take in the election of this officer which otherwise be choose by favour friendship or affection of one of little sufficiency result many enconvenience it alsoe fale out often time that such person so choose want the prudence authority perfection and brave conduction in he require lose often time his due respect and reverence of the captain and other officeres wherefore it be far better for he to remain a captain rather than intermiddell in a matter which require such great capacity and perfect experience in war in of march he be to consider the quality and conditione of the country if fertile or scant if hilly or plain and not to permit to mount a horseback but as feowe as can possible alsoe to consider the quantity of baggage and provision you be to carry and that to by as little as may be possible as before speak rather only so much as need shall require and that the want thereof can not be excuse after that all thing necessary for your march be treat and consult of and put in order yove shall command that all the company of your regiment shall join master camp shall ordain and think most fit then bigen to make your devitione to march as your superior shall command but if only one regiment do march by itself the sardgent mayor be to consult with his master de camp never failenge if they march in any place or country where yove shall chance or fear to encounter your enemy to provide yourself with certain barreles of powder match and bullet that always yove carry of thigh rather more than lesh some pike fear to want a quantity of shovel bill hatchete which be necessary if need or occasion require to make a way with tree bough and earth in place where with difficulty the infantry and baggage may pass or to cut try to shut up a pasadge of o sudden or to make even place when otherwise but with great difficulty you can pass they thigh be necessary pertrecho for not know when occasion may offer to have need of they and special pase trough a foreign country in of march the sardgente mayor be to make the devitione and ordain where each captain shall lead and in such manner that each captain shall take his turn meaning that the captain or captain that do lead this day the Musketteria shall to morrow lead the that do follow and another day the pike and another day the of the rergarde and so fall a neowe and be his turn take possession of the vantegarde and rearguard as his turn shall fall and it be enough to ordain this once and let each one unconfusedlie be his turn take place of the vanguard rearguard and battle pase trough any city or place where any danger may by suspect in the devitione of the shot and pike great industry and consideration be to by use your shot be to march in good order and not confuse and be no mean to let none miss his rank give order to all the shot to light their match and to by ready of a sudden if need require and otherwise where they re be nothing suspect one or two match in every rank may serve it be not amiss to have no more baggage than need shall require and not to permit the souldiere to put they re muskete in wagones as often time they do and in ofringe occasion to serve with they it happen that trough this bad custom many be of no service with the barreles and look of their muskete brocken so that in time of most need they want it be most necessary that the sardgente mayor and captain by curious to see many fault redrese and that the souldiere be well provide of all necessary in as much as can by possible and special the shot to by well furnish with bullet at lest five and in no case to fail in this the captain and alferise be to go brave arm with complete corselete and let no captain not Alferis horseback till all the devitione of shot and pike be well order and when all the baggage be ready and that the master camp do pass to the vanguard then have all thing in order in amile distance from the quarter the sardgente mayor shall step into the vanguard and give order to the captain to go a horsebake and not before as alsoe the alferise and other particular person the alferise recomendinge they re culoure to they re a vanderadose and the captain or captain that be of the vanguard shall permit no souldiere to pass but such as have order in write for the same from the general or master camp general or ordinary master camp and the captain that go in the rerergarde shall take a special care to permit none to tarry behende but rather cause they to step forward to they re rank that alsoe no boy nor sutlere by permit to stay behind for some of purpose do stay to no good intend but to steal rob and spoil the pour enhabitante good which be a thing not to by permit and such sutlere and other unruly factionere as be give to this base and odious act be to be severe punish in public whereof special care ought to be take for many respect before you march the captain and all the sutlere and ammunition vagones be all to by draw out of the quarter ordain those that shall guard they and then consideration be to be take of the manner who to march with the ammunition and baggage which be that if it by know that the enemy be to by fear in the vanguard on the way where yove be to pass let the baggage by place in the rearward and if contrary yove have intelligence to fear the enemy in the rearward yove be to pass the baggage to the vanguard and if on the right side to conduct it to the leefte and if on the leifte side transport it to the right and in this manner the army be small or great it shall be a brickwall and defence to the a munition and baggage and this don by always provide and order in due time for otherwise it be a great miss if sudden occasion shall represent and that the enemy of a sudden shall fall upon and charge on yove douptless it be a great let and danger if yove be not provide and well order to prevente the sudden and stratagem of the enemy they re ought to by send certain light horse to scout and revewe before a certain distance so be advertise before the enemy a proache all thing necessary may by prevent in due time the furiell mayor or quartermaster with the rest be to march all at once and not otherwise for to make the quarter in due time for if otherwise they go they may use fraud and villainy in spoil the villadge and pour enhabitante to who all equity justice and good example be to be minister for many good respect some souldiere of little honour and reputation some time in they re march to ease themselves do break they re pike or leave the same behind of such base fellow the sardgent mayor be to take a special care to see they severe punish in public except it be one that be sick or hurt of which person he be present to give enteligence to their captain and see that order be tacken to save they in ocasione of march the sardgent mayor be to order and make his devitione when he think that all the souldiere of his regiment be gather and comenge to a conveniente place to frame a squadron of they of whate form he think best and when he come within a mile to the quarter where he be to lodge with his regiment he be to step forward to see which be the fiteste place to frame a battle as alsoe to revewe the sally and entry of the quarter the quartermaster be to receive he and sheowe how and where the regiment shall be lodge as alsoe the fiteste place for the embattellinge of his regiment and after the squadron be frame he be to a point the company that shall be on the watch that night if on the general a or master camp or elsh where let he see that there by no empediment in the place where he choise to be more fit for the frame of his squadron alsoe he be to be very careful and diligent in ordaininge the necessary place for the watch and he shall a point guard a good distance from the quarter so that the enemy of a sudden do not fall upon he of which for many respect great consideration ought to by take and prudenr prevent he be to procure with the master camp to cause or proclamation to by beat for the in pass the word in march battle or eilsh where and such as do not observe this to see they severe punish for this be amatter of great emportance and whereof great disordere and do resulte often time for not observe the same the word be to by give be four person that be the master camp sardgent mayor and from the captain that lead the vanguard and from he that lead the rergarde and great speed ought to by tacken from whence it come and the cause for it may be that the enemy shall of a sudden chance to fall on the rergarde or that some other ocation of emportance may offer for which respect and many more this order be to be inviollabble observe and let it with great speed pass from rank to rank in your march or order it be most necessary now and then to make some or stand to ease the and refresh they with such sort of vituale as they carry a long with they and special where they re be commodity of water and take a special care that some unruly fellow by not permit to go out of the order and fall aspoylinge the country neither their boy the sardgent mayor be to oversee and inform of all thing that pase in his regiment and give order to the captain or borachell to see that his sutlere by well provide with vituale and other necessary thereunto a pertaininge and to take a special care that no wrong by don unto they but rather to see severe punish such as will presume to do they wrong that there by they may with will mind a accomplish they re in furnish themselves with vituale and other comodity and alsoe the sardgente mayor be to see that they be well pay for otherwise be ill pay and see that there be no justice minestre they will run away and give a bad report so that no other sutlere shall dare to come and so provision will be want to the great discomodity of the officeres and the captain be to use discression and conscience in see that the sutlere do fell there vituale with such concideration that they may gain and not overpress the power soldier trough covetousness and griddie deceit as often time they do in thigh and many more if the sardgente mayor be courious and careful in a complisinge with his hardly can any thing pass without discovery and redress in due time for he be aprincipall minister to oversee redresh and remedy many fault disordere and fraud and he be in conscience bind to procure the good of the pour soldier that no fraud be permit in deceivinge he of his power mean if the sardgente mayor be in the field with his regiment alittle before the fall of the night he be to relive the watch so that the enemy may not discover they come nor go but in garrison the watch be to be soon set in aspecial care ought to be take that the enemy for cause of our negligence little care and prudence do not of asodain fall on we be un provide for to prevente such sudden it be necessary that a corpe be ordain acertaine distance towards the enemy where yove most suspect they re come which be a great security for that quarter of the camp but this must be set at the fall of the night and they re can hardly any fire be make that the enemy may not discover yove they ought to be very ready vary and vigilante with there arm at hand to fall on the enemy if of asoddaine they be thereunto constrain and see if they can find any conveniente shadowoe to shelter they and if perhaps the enemy spy do know or discover who our watch be set and not know of this watch set so late and so secret it may fall out that the enemy may fall into they re hand for not be advertise by there spy of the prevention take and fall of a sudden on they and give the a alarm to the whole camp so that they may be ready in due time to prevente the enemy his and purpose and at length cause they to retire in execute nothing of they re design or desire for this purpose must by choose a captain who be well know to by prudent and valerouse and of a brave and resolute determination and find the enemy let he in no c^se follow they any great distance for they may prevente he with a secret ambuscado and find they pass the ambuscado fall on they on both side before and behind and defeat he often time it happen that raw Souldieres and man of little consideration do give a alarm without any wherefore they be to by advertise not to give any such till they by inform and well assure that it be the enemy for such as otherwise do they be esteem of little consideration and of a weak spirit find themselves present a mased trust to they re inconsiderate imagination of no firm ground nor reason figuringe in they re imagination to have see this and that and of no purpose nor firmness advertise that if a alarm be give where occasion do present it be not to pass all the camp in sound drum and trumpete but rather very secret and without any rumour nor voice and with great silence join and speedy put themselves in order which ordere the master camp general or the person that command shall command to be observe all over so that all thing by prevent with better order and with settle mind and if otherwise the a alarm be give every where it be hard to know in due time where the occasion be the centerie ought to by very firm and see one come let he not stir but rather prepare himself till he be well inform and know that it be a enemy then in a prochinge near and assure to shoot at he and to be assure in as much as may possible not to miss and be a pikeman he be to let he come under the puiesh of the pike and then give the a alarm show himself with a valerouse determination and kill the enemy or take he and to learn the design of the enemy and to whate purpose he be employ and then to retire to the next adjoin cinterie and from thence to the second and so from hand to hand till he be send to the first guard and from thence present to the sardgent mayor advertisenge that every cintery shall remain in his a point place and to be very vary and vigilante fear that othere shall follow and inter of a sudden find conveniente opportunity for they re purpose another thing be to be consider that some time it do happen that a spy favourable to we do come from the enemy camp to give we intelligence of whate occur which spy be to be receive and cause he to stand or make till the officer of the guard by advertise who be to receive he and present carry he to the sardgent mayor who shall his master camp and without delay conduct he to the superior to inform and he the cause of his come if be chance the enemy shall fall on the pikeman stand in cinterie and see that they be of such force that he can not resist let he retire to the next cintery shoot that he may shoot at they and give the alarm and so by little and little retire and the pikeman shall with all speed go to the first watch and give intelligence of the occasion that they may be readdie in time and this order ought the sardgente mayor to give that all thing may be do in order and in due time give alsoe order to the watch and culoure where they shall 'oyne and whate they shall do so that without delay they shall be find to be put in order to fight as the situation of the place and occasion shall require in all place on the frontier of the enemy where great suspicion may be fear of sudden exploit and embuscado of the enemy in such place and the sardgente mayor be to give order in the morning that no cintery do retire till all place of suspicion by visit and then the cinterie perdue shall retire a little further inward and he be to by examine to see if he do a accomplish the vigilance care and trust refer to the of his fidelity and find his reason and proof good in a complish his he be wourdie of thanks and if the country be find and he be find hide in some sure place of no danger nor service to reward he a cordinge his merit with a public reprehension for not a complish his obligation in a place of such importance and so shall he be reward and impute be all brave Souldiores which do hire of his do and pusilanimity when intelligence be have that the enemy be readdie to fall on you or that any suspicion or a peerance may by of the same eaverie one ought to be readdie with they re arm in hand with a settle mind and brave determination so that with the first alarm they may have no kind of let but present follow they re leader without beat drum or phife or make any kind of rumour but rather with great silence fall in to they re order and concideringe that this be not only for the they owe unto they re king or prince but alsoe for the safeguard honour and security of they re own person for thigh and such all honourable Souldiores ought to by well prepare and special the shot with they re piece all in areadines with as much powder as they re flask can hold and twenty five bullet so that in offereinge ocation he shall not call for powder and lead as some careless and covardlie fellow be wont to do not be well provide before hand little regard the king service and they re own reputasion to prevente thigh and such fault they re officere ought always to see all thing prevent in due time so that they re be no escuse and such as will not a accomplish the same in prepare all necessary befitinge as ordain for that purpose to see they reprehend and in case the soldier have not wherewith to buy thigh and other inescusable want the captain be to help he thereunto for be conveniente for his majesty service that the souldere always be well provide and such as do not obey thigh inescusable want to give they public afronte like covardlie and disobedient fellow such souldiere as be of prudente carriage and have a special care in accomplish with punctuality they re and in give good example to othere to imitate they unwourdie be the captain and officere that will not honour further and assist they for in thigh we see many brave and honourable Souldiores which be wont ordinary to of extraordinary good match in there pockete with the two end of the same in areadines and rub in powder that without delay it may kindel fire and alsoe with a fleaskillo in his pocket with fine and dry powder for touch powder which if it be wet and afterwards dry in or in ginepe oil or in both together it be very good which be well dry can not miss and such souldiere as be know to be curious and punctual in this and many more they re captain and officer ought to have a special care to honour and prefer they a cordinge to the trial of their valour care punctuality and prudence in give good example and show themselves in all and with a brave and resolute determination which be a wonderful comfort to they re captain and put he in great hope of the victory and good success unhappy be the captain and unwourdie of the name that will not make know to his brave souldiere his incline affection towatde they and special in time of most need in ordaininge the conveniente place for the cintery both in the field and garrison the sardgente mayor be to use great discrestion in oversienge all the circuide and entry of most importance and danger and after viwenge all he be to a point a conveniente place where each cintery shall by place a luenge twenty five or forty pace betwixt every cintery some time more and some time less as occasion shall require but in the field be there to be a point a cinterie perdue or rather call it the contrary the security of the camp this cintinel be to be put double meaning a pike and a caliver in a distance of some o honderth pace little more or less towards the enemy and without all the other cintery in the place or place where there be most suspicion of the enemy to come some hold a opinion that this cinterie be not to get the word not so for if they see or hire any rumour or a peerance of the enemy come the pikeman shall repair with speed and tell the next cintery whate he have either see or hear and if he have not the word or he shall not let he come near and this cinterie with speed be to let this pass to the next and so from hand to hand very secret and silent till it come to the next adjoin watch or guard that they may be prevent in time these cintery of right be to be caul the security of the camp rather than centerie perdue they be to by choose of valerouse and settle souldiere of good judgement and brave and when the advice come with good security to the watch that the enemy be in arm or approach near present the master camp and sardgente mayor be to be advertise and they be with speed to advertise the master camp general in find as before true relation of the occasion to by suspect of any emportance these outward cintery be never to retire but when urgente and assure occasion do constrain they thereunto in see the enemy a prochinge and not before and until they reviwe if it be foot or horse or if they come in order of squadron or march in single file after well reviwenge they let they retire to the next cintery and let the word pass very secret from hand to hand till it come to the next watch or let the pikeman go forward with neowe and the other stay with the first cintinell till they be constrain to retire to the next and so retire be little and a little observe still the enemy and with whate order they do march and so fall into they re own people and inform of all of whate they have both see and hear and see they come disorder think to fall upon we of asoddaine be a sleep or in provide then we to turn upon they with full resolution with the short drum and phise which douptlesse if as before they come they shall find themselves pussele and amaze these exploit require prudence valeor silence and brave resolution it be necessary that the sardgent mayor give order that upon pain of death none do presume to give a false alarm without occasion except it be with order of the superior and in skirmise or assault with the enemy let the sardgent mayor give order that none call for powder but very silent for it be a thing most odious and of little discretion that the enemy shall know of our want in such if need require the pike and rapere will serve in good steed if the with brave resolution and determination do a accomplish they re for which extremity be require a prudent and brave conductor of a valerouse and resolute determination in all in the field where the enemy be to be fear and suspect the sardgent mayor be to give order that the outward cintery of we next unto the enemy do take a special care that none do pass unto the enemy from our camp which be rather to be suspect then if one of the enemy come into we for such as run unto the enemy they may be suspect that they go with some advice or secret intelligence if such person can not be kill or tacken let they re warn by present give to his captain and then present to the sardgent mayor who at that instant shall command that no soldier of the watch who have the word shall be permit to leave the same that night he shall deliver the to deliver they re captain to see the same execute and in such the watch word be to by change and if any body by find absent of those of the watch let they re warn present be give to the captain for it may be a villain of a base mind and that he do go with some advice to the enemy and within four or five day after come into our camp and give faluse excuse hope to be pardon and commit more villainy in thigh good heed ought to be take a very necessary thing it be in a sardgent mayor to by careful in see that all the souldiere of his regiment be well arm and that there may be no escuse in a complish they re in escusinge that their arm be brocken or a mind all thigh and many more may they re captain and in time without trouble the sardgente mayor theyrwithall for he have to many other employmente of great moment and as isay thigh may be well prevent be they re officere be coriouse and careful when occasion shall require that the sardgent mayor will have out of certain company of his regiment a quantity of Souldieres to be employ this he be to demand of the captain who be to appoint and ordain the number demand and not to intermidle in take they otherwise for the captain be he which be to give a and reason of the souldiere of his company and the Sardgentr mayor in no case be to intermidel in take they but those which the captain shall appoint for the sardgente mayor have no authority to take they otherwise except they be on the watch and that urgente occasion shall be offer which require great speed and in such the officer be not present he may take they and such souldiere as the sardgente mayor shall demand the captain be to make no of all such as be necessary for his majesty service but he be not to intermidle in take from any officer any privilege a pertaininge to the of his office which if otherwise he shall presume it be a sinister and odious thing in war some time it happen that pincionere gentleman of the artillery and other particular person be employ be the master decampe general and by the general of the artillery and be othere which be to be permit to pass to deliver their mesadge in due time and none ought to trouble or molest they in there voyadge except they be suspect the sardgent mayor be to take care that if his regiment in which may happen they break upon the enemy and follow on the victory let none in pain of death fall a rob the hurteman nor none of the slaughter which if any officer find they in that base act in such may execute this sentence be most base and odious but rather pursue the victory and keep his order as behoove a honourable soldier of resolute and noble mind to do in like manner in force of arm into any town or strong place the sardgent mayor be to by very vigilant and careful that no soldier of whatesoever quality or condition be permit to inter into any house either ro rob or steal till such time as the enemy be whole vanquise that no danger nor execution of theyre may be fear and that till all there fury be paste and that upon pain of death for otherwise they incur great danger some leave they re arm hire and they re in divers place of which if the enemy take pocession they may easy master they of such blind ingnorance and covetouse desire of gain great disgrace may resulte if the enemy do secret join in some secret place and fall in masteringe they re arm and murder they which may well fall out if prevention be not use as before declare in such sort that the enemy may not come in possession of the honeor gain with the life and loss of so many brave Souldiores for the of rare exploit and brave interprise in war be require prudent and brave conduction and special that the sardgent mayor be most earnest to exercise the officeres and of his regiment which be so practise in war great may be hope of they be exersise in well manadgeinge they re arm observe their order and not stiringe out of the same when they march in know who to fall into squadron and observe the give and ordain be the general nothing so dificill but that contuall use and exercise make easy who soever will fain be couriouse in the frame of many sort of batteles it be necessary that he be exercise both in the theoric and pratike of this art and special to be able in aritmetick so shall he in time bring his purpose to perfection with great ease and let he be careful in know who to give the ordere to each officer of whate shall be commend to his charge and cause all thingss to be a complished as they be ordain without reply he shall not recall any order give except it be trough good concideration neither shall none be discomodate to put another in his place by favour or affection great consideration ought to be take in choysinge one of befitinge part for the well execute of this office and that be no mean it be give be favour or affection for many of emportance after those of perfection in this art we loocke daily and find feowe but those of imperfection in multitude some hold a opinion that in ordere of march and frame of squadrone the number be best true it be that this number be good but in the divitione to fall out of yovure march into squadron let none be ingnorante that they be to march acording as the devition fall out and for be of number or it import nothing and for the contrariethere be no rule buth rather conform with the divitione as they shall fall out which be the true way for we find no other reason to the contrary neither have pirho king of the epirote the first enventor of squadron neither the roman greek nor macedonios nor any other nation a sardgent mayor ought not to by ingnorante in frame and give reason of all sort of squadrone at jest all such as ocation and situation shall require of which the sardgent mayor ought to be curious and not to err in any thing that belong to his office and special in the devitione and frame of sundry sort of squadrone though many do imagine and suppose it needless more than only the four form they be far deceive for and shall offer where neither of the four form will serve in frame of batteles the sardgent mayor be to sheowe himself with a settle prudent and brave resolution and by no mean permit any crosinge or confusion in the ordere be he appoint nor wrong none to take he out of his rank for he that come late so hittinge upon the just devitione of his shot and pike he shall place a officer or two as he think best in the head of each devition and that the do a accomplish they re in letinge none to stragel nor fall out of they re rank so the sardgent mayor shall with ease and brevity frame his squadron and without any cross or confusion be so conveniente for each company of pike shall take they re turn on the watch and so need no controversy nor confusion the master camp as a superior of his regiment be to choice to march where he please and if there by two company of A^cabuse^os the one be to march in the vanguard and the other in the rergarde it be enough that the sardgente mayor give once thigh ordere that each one be his turn shall come do obtain his right in of march without trouble he any more but if they re be more than one regiment each of they shall take they re tear acording as they have the watch march first upon the right hand and so go by turn and shall alsoe be lodge first and the rest of the company without any cross or confusion as they come yea if it be to frame a battle of the whole many good part be require in a sardgent mayor and principal to be expert in well execute his office to observe good order in march to prudent finish with expedition his affair to reprehend and redress disordere in due time with prudence and authority so shall he be belove and respect and most common have good success in the great dangere he be ^o^hcowe himself with asetled mind and brave couradge animatinge the souldiere show himself with they in all dangere and extremity comfort and give they good and example and in the great dangere that shall happen to presence himself with they with a brave and valerouse determination so douptles shall he by belove fear and respect by they let he by no mean be overcome by disorder a but rather be moderate mild and fair condisioned a^ be^itinge ^o person of so great command treat of several sort of squadrone bigininge with the rule who to find out the square root of any number the table pitagorique a table ^^ by put in memory for the frame of squadrone for such as be not expert in arithmetic the table of the of unequal number and who to frame several sort of squadrone of several sort of weapon and the industry use for they re due order and devidinge in proportion acording as time occasion and situation shall require and permit a square root be a or number which be multiply in itself bring four a square number as 2 be multiply in itself make the 4. in say two time two make the 4. and so from the number 1. to the number 9 yove shall understand in the table pitagorique the raise of 1. can not be but 1. the ray of 4. be 2. the raise of 9 be 3. the ray of 16. be 4. that of 25. be 5. and so consequent as in the table follow yove may perceive to find out the square root of any number be it square or not square yove must work thus first have set down the number propound which at the jest must consist of 3. figure set a prick under the first digitt of the say number on the right hand that donpricke every other or number thereof towards the leiftehande have always one void space or chifer betwixt every 2. prick as yove see here do in the number follow 946. to find out the square root of this propound number yove be to prick the say number as before teach have so do seek out one of the 3. digite which be multiply in itself may take a way the chifer 9 that be on the left hand or as much thereof as may by in say 3. time 3. make 9 so that 3. be the ray of 9 first chifer of your propound number and rest nothing which yove shall put right a above the 9 so that yove have whole do with the 9 that lie on the left hand that do double the quotient which be 3. and it make 6. and set the same in the void place right under the figure 4. and seek out a or number which be multiply in itself may take a way the 4. and say how many time 6. can yove find in 4. nullo so set down 0. in the quotient right under the 6. that stand the on the right hand and say that in plasinge nullo in the quotient yove have do and there rest 46. that remain so say that 30. be the square root of 946. and there remain 46. that be not comprehend in the square root in say multiply 30. the square root of 946. by 30. and it will make 900. to which 900. a^ 46. that remain and it shall a the full some of your propound number of 946. as by the proof yove plain see in all such number to know whether yove have do well or no multipliy the square root by itself to the producte of which multiplication yove be to add if there by any remainder and if yove find the sum thereof to be like to your first propound number yove have do well and if it be not like yove have errede but if such number do consist of many number or figure in workenge whereof yove must double the quotient once twece or threece acording as the number do require which yove shall more plain perceive by this example follow presupose that 37424 be the number whereof yove will know the square root to do the which wourke as before teach first prick the 4. that stand on the right hand then fall to prick the other 4. towards to left hand and have so do prick the 3. that stand on the left hand of all now seek out some or number which be multiply in itself take a way the last chifer on the left hand which be 3. or the most thereof that can be which yove shall find to by 1. and have set down the say 1. in the quotient say one time one be 1. which be substract out of 3. rest 2. which be to be place right over the 3. and conzeale the say 3. that don double the quotient 1. and it make 2. which yove be to place right under the 7 of your propound numberin the second place towards the left hand that do say who many time 2 in 27. yove shall find it to be 9 in say 9 time 2. be 18. out of 27 rest 9 which yove shall place right over and above the 7. in the second place on the left hand and in the quotient right under the prick of the chifer 4 in the 3 place towards the left hand yove shall place 9 have so do say 9 time 9 be 81. be substract out of 94. rest 13. now double the 18 in the quotient and it will be 38. which yove shall place under the 9 in the quotient towards the right hand have so do say how many time 38. in 132. that stand right above it yove shall find it to be 3. which yove shall place in the quotient under the first prike on the right hand under the chifer 4. that don say 3. time 3. make 9 out of 13. rest 4. then say 3. time 8. make 24 out of 42. rest 18 that do fall to the 3. in the quotient and multiply it in itself and it make 9 which yove shall substract out of the producte of your last division which be 184. and there shall remain 175. so that 193. be the square root of the first number give which be 37424 which square be multiply in itself be 37249. and the remainder be 175. which two be put together make the first number of 37424. yove be alsoe to understand that if yove find any number out of which your quotient be double and can not be substract yove must set down a chifer in the quotient as yove do in division most necessary it be for a sardgent mayor or who soever do pretend to be curious in the profession of arm that he be expert in aritmeticke and in know who to find out the square root of any number that he may with the more facility order divide and rank his souldiere either of great or small number yea and of whate soever form a sardgent mayor ought not to be ignorant for some time occasion and situation offer that neither of the 4. form of squadrone be to be use wherefore I will set down the rule first for the frame of the four form of squadrone most a custom and most in use as alsoe the rule to frame squadrone acording to the situation and disposition of the place and to fight as well of equality as of inequality the 4. form of squadrone most acustom and most in use be the square of man the square of ground bastard square and broad square which the Spaniarde call frente gentle reader understand that the first thing to by understand in frame of squadrone be that the principal body of they be to be frame of pike to the which be require a certain quantity of shot which be to be divide as time situation and occasion shal-require touch which great consideration and industry be require in many occurante of warlike affair and it be of great importance for who so ever take this charge in hand to be perfect in aritmeticke to facilitate many rare occurrante of this art and special in the office of a sardgent mayoyr it be to be understand that the rule which be observe in setinge in order or array Souldieres be that from the shoulder of the one to the shoulder of the other be require 3. foot or at the most three and haulf and from rank to rank 7. foot meaning from the breast of the one to the back of the other but when occasion shall offer to fight 3. foot or 3 @ be I noghe from rank to rank meaning from the breast of the own to the back of the other and one for his one station so that he ocupy before and behind and for his person 7. foot to form a squadron square of man yove shall work as before teach in find out the square root which shall serve for front and flank as by the example follow yove shall more plain understand suppose that yove be to frame a squadron square of man of 464. pike to find out the square root of this number first prick the last chifer 4. towards the right hand that do prick the other 4. towards the left hand so that the figure 6. stand in the midel now fall to the 4. that stand on the left hand and say the raise of 4. be 2. in say two time two make 4. which 4 yove be to substract out of the 4 that stand on the left hand then conzeale the 4. and please azero above it now fall to 2. that be in the quotient and say two time two make 4. which yove shall place right under the 6. which lie in the mideste of the number give and say how many time 4 in 6. which can be but one in say 4. time 1. make 4. out of 6. rest but 2. which 2. you shall place a above the 6. and canzeale the 6. that do fall to 1. that lie in the quotient under the chifer 4. on the right hand and say one time one be 1. out of 4 that lay on the right hand there shall rest 3. which shall be plase right over the 4. towardae the right hand then canzeale the 4. and there shall remain 23. so that 21. be your front and flank and 23. remain which shall serve to guarnish the culoure to see if yove have do well multiply 21. the square root in itself and the producte will by 441. to which producte 23. pike that do remain and the some thereof will be like unto the first number give which be 464. as by the figure follow yove may see a battle square of man of 464. pike who front and flank be 21. for such as be not expert in aritmeticke I have set down the a fore say table to find the square root of any number to then thousand which shall help much such as be not able in aritmetike but such as be incline to be perfect in this noble art of war I will wish they not to whole trust to this rule for the reason before declare but rather learn to be perfect in arithmetic which be the sure way a squadron square of man of 361. soldier of the which 144. be pike and 217. muskete front of the battle square of man 144 pike 48 musk. 36 musk. 76 musk. 57 musk. 361 suppose that yove be to frame a squadron square of man of 361. soldier of the which 144. be pike and 217. be muskete and that yove will have the squadron proportional line every way with the shot to work the which first take the square root of the 144. pike which yove shall find to be 12. and say that 12. be the front and flank of the squadron of pike that do take the whole number of shot and pike which be 361. out of the which alsoe take the square root which yove shall find to be 19 out of this 19 substract 12. the square root of the pike and there shall remain 7. and so yove find the number that yove demand for the girdlinge shoot now divide the 7. into two part and say that yove find 4 in one part and 3. in the other and say that by your division yove find that the first maniple of muskete be to march with 12. rank of 4. muskete in each rank which be for the linenge shoot of the right flank of your squadron that don say that also by your last division yove find 12. rank of 3. muskete in each rank to guarinshe the liefte flank of your squadron and say that the two flank of your squadron be linede with shot meaning 4. in each rank of the linenge of the right flank and 3. in each rank of the linenge of the liefte flank so the two flank be line that do say that 12. the front of your pike adinge thereunto 7. muskete of the linenge of the two flake make 19 and say that in your last division yove find that 19 rank of 4. musquete in each rank be to march for the linenge shoot of the vanguard and alsoe 19 rank of 3. muskete be to march in the last division of shot for the linenge of the rergarde of your battle as by the figure before and in the of the same yove see plain declare and so your squadron of pike be proportional line every way in as much as the division and number can afford a squadron square of man of 576. soldier of the which 256. be pike and 320. muskete divide proportional as by the figure follow yove see front of the battle 256 pike 64 64 96 96 576. for the frame of all such squadrone either of great or small number which yove will have to be proportional line with shot yove shall work in this manner follow first take the number of pike which be 256. out of the which take the square root which be 16. and say that so many pike shall the front and flank of your battle contain and that it be of equal strength every way as well to offend as to defend and when yove will draw they into squadron for the more brevity yove may divide the front thereof into two maniple each one contain 16. rank of 8. pike in each rank now to proportional guarnish the same with the shot take your full number of pike and shot which be 576. out of which number take the square root which yove shall find to by 24. that don substract 16. the square root of the pike out of 24. the square of the full number of pike and shot and there shall remain 8. this divide into two equal part which be four in each part and say that the squadron of pike be to be line every way with 4. shot as by the division of the same yove see meaning that your first division of shot be to march with 16. rank of 4. muskete in each rank which be to line the right flank of your squadron of pike and so many more rank shall march to line the left flank of the squadron of pike meaning 16. rank of 4. muskete in every rank so the two flank of your squadron be line that don say that the front of your squadron be 16. and thereunto add 8 the linenge shoot of the two flank and it will a to 24. to line the front of your battle say that yove be to march with 24. rank of 4. muskete in each rank and so many more for the linenge of the rearward of your battle as the figure and show and so shall yove find your squadron proportional line every way which by the rule form and of the same yove may plain understand this rule will serve to frame all such sort of squadrone either of great or small number which yove will have to be proportional line with shot as plain the figure and before sheowethe in many country hardly can you find the one haulf of their pike arm with complett corselete so that this rule will sheowe yove how to guarnish the unarmed pike with the complett corselete proportional every way advertise that the culoure be to march in the centre a cross battle of 1416. souldiere of the which 512. be pike and 904. muskete which be to be divide into 4 batteles and line proportional on the two flank as by the figure and follow be reason to work the which first take the number of pike for each squadron of the 4. require for your cross battle now to your purpose take the square root of 128. pike of your first squadron which will be 11. and 7. pike remain and say that 11. pike be the front and flank of your first battle of pike as alsoe of the other 3. batteles and 7. pike remain in each battle which shall serve to the culoure so that 11^ be the front and flank of each one of your 4. batteles of pike and 7. pike remain for the linenge of the culoure of each battle of the 4. now for the division of your propound number of shot double the one flank of each one of the 4. batteles of pike which double will by 88 this 88 the double flank of the 4. batteles of pike divide by 904. your propound number of muskete and the number in the quotient will by 10. and 24 muskete remain and say that the two flank of each of your 4. batteles of pike be to by line with 11. rank of ten muskete in each rank as by the figure and deutione folowenge yove may plain see and with the observation of this rule with any other number either great or small yove shall with facility know how to proportionable divide your shoot for to the two flank of your squadron of pike thief cross batteles be esteem to be wonderful strong consider well the frame thereof it be also of wonderful safeguard for the security of the baggage amunitione and hurt man and if the enemy shall chance to charge the first battle or any of the other 3. which be alone be but of little force wherefore consideration ought to be take of the stratagem of the enemy and with what order they do march and then yove may double or tribele your front acording as occasion shall require and the situation shall permit and if the enemy be strong on horse regard ought to be take in due time of the baggage that it go or be twexte the two last batteles and for their better security in such I will cut two rank of each of the two last batteles and therwithe guarnishe the front and regard of the baggage and also with shot under the shelter of this guarnison of pike so that they may be shadow and defend every way and give a triple front to the two last batteles cross battle several sort of arm be manadge in all coutry and in many place hardly can yove find the one haulf of their pike arm with complett corselete wherefore I teach fit to set down the rule for the due order in proportion of these several sort of arm for be most necessary in many in warlike affair put in case yove have 1112. souldiere of the which 260. be unarm pike 316. arm with complett corselete 114. officere reform and particular person who be arm with guilt corselete and for the linenge shoot 422. muskete of the which number the camp master general will have a squadron square of man to be frame puttenge the unarmed pike in the centre proportional line every way with the arm corselte and the arm pike proportional line with the guilt corselete and officere reform as also that the 4. side of the full battle of pike to be proportional guarinsh with the 422. muskete to work the which first take 260. which be the unarmed pike out of which take the square root which be 16 and. 4 pike remain and say that 16 pike be the front and flank of your centre of unarmed pike that don take the full number of unarmed and arm pike which be 576. out of which also take the square root which will be 24. now deduct of this 24.16 the raise or square root of the unarmed pike and there shall remain 8. this 8. divide into two part and it be 4. in each part and say that 16. rank of 4. corselete in each rank be to guarnish the right flank of your centre of unarmed pike and so many more for the guarnision of the leifte flank of the centre of the unarmed pike now to proportional line the front of the centre say that to 16 the front of the centre be to be ad 8 of the 2. line which make the 24. so say that the front be to be guarinsh with 24. rank of 4. arm pike in each rank and so be the front of your centre and unarmed pike line and the rearward be to be guarinsh with the self same order imeane 24. rank of arm pike of 4. pike in each rank so the centre of the unarmed pike be proportional line every way with the complete corselete now to line the arm pike with the 114. guilt corselete take the full number of pike as well arm as unarm which be 690. out of which take the square root which be 26. out of this 26. the last ray deduct 24. the square root of your arm and unarmed pike and there shall rest 2. this 2. divide into two part which will be one and say that the right flank of the arm pike be to be guarinsh with only 24. guilt pike which just ocupy place of one in each rank of the flank and just so many more for to the leifte flank of the arm pike and say that the two flank be guarinsh now your front be 26. and just so many guilt pike be to the outward side of the arm corselete and just so many for the linenge of the rearward so your squadron be proportional guarinsh every way imeane the centre with the arm pike and the arm pike with the guilt corselete now to divide your 422. muskete you be to take the square root of the propound and full number of pike and shot which be 1112. which square root will be 33. out of this square deduct 26. the square root that be of the full number of pike and there shall remain 7 this 7. divide into two part the one will be 4. and the other 3. and say that by your devition you find that the right flank of your squadron of pike be to be line with 26. rank of 4. muskete in each rank that do say that for the linenge shoot of the leifte flank your devition yealdethe 26. rank of 3. muskete in each rank so be your two flank of the squadron of pike line with shot now with the two linenge of shot you find the front to contain 33. and say that 33. rank of 4. muskete be to line the full front of the battle of pike and 33. rank of 3. muskete in each rank be to guarnish the full front of the rearward for by the rule of divition and proportion it can not be other wise so your unarmed pike be in the centre proportional line with the corselete and the corselete with the guilt armour and the squadron of pike proportional line every way with the 422. muskete as you shall see by the figure and devisione follow advertise that in your devisione there do remain 4. unarmed pike and 14. of the guilt corselete and five muskete as in the wing you may see all which be comprehend in the 23. the remainder of your last division as here follow declare a

the proportion of many sort of squadrone and unequal number ^ teach necessary to put hire the tabel and rule for the same as hire follow I will wish allsuche as do pretend to step forward in the noble profeshion of arm trough there prudent carriage and good to consider that many good part be require in they amongst the which we find it most necessary that he be expert in aritmeticke for otherwise hardly can he bring unto perfection the rare curiosity require to the several execution of the art of war and especial the sundry devisione of the several sort of squadrone which by daily trial and experience we see that many who be not curious nor expert in aritmeticke do err in very many ocasione and can not compass nor bring to just perfection with grace many rare occurante in warlike affair and that for the most part result of there little in imitatenge the vertouse prudent and approve soldier and also trough the blind consideration of some who consider that now in our late war for the most part all go by favour friendship or affection yea and very many by mean of enteres so that very many do not take the pain in aplieinge themselves in learning the several rare curiosity of this art but rather mock and flout at those of rare and curious judgement by cause that their skill and capacity can not reach in resolvinge the rare and deep secret of this art after those of perfection in this art we look for those of imperfection we find on every foot so none ought to reprehend in absence whereof in presence he be ingnorante of inequality be that the battle may be more broad then long or more in front then in flank thief of inequality be as 2. to 1. that be to say the battle to be two time more broad then long or more in front then in flank as be one to three or 1. to 4. ett or the battle to be three time or 4. time more broad then long or more in front then in flank or to be 2@ or 3@ more broad then long or any other such like to which effect I put this table and the rule thereunte apertaininge to reduce these into whole number and to know their proportion you be to work in this manner follow first multiply the whole number by the and add thereunto the numerator of the say fraction and the proportion be find as for example to have the battle to contain so much and the one haulf more in front then in flank which the Spaniard call seek in the table 1@ where of the whole number be 1. and the fraction be @ now multiply the whole number 1. by the fraction be 2. and it make 2. whereunto you shallad the say which be 1. which two adisione do amount 3. and the be 2. so say it be in proportion as be 2. to 3. and so must yove work with all such number to know the proportion thereof or say that you will have the battle to be 3 3/3. more in front then in flank and to find the proportion say it be as 3. to 10. as in the table yove shall see and that yove may better understand it work as before teach first in multiplienge the whole number 3. by 3. the and it will be 9 to this 9 1. which be the and it will be 10 and say that it be in proportion as 3. to 10. and with this observation and rule you shall know in what proportion shall by any number to frame a battle of 819. Souldieres which shall contain so much and the one haulf more in front then in flank which the Spaniarde and italian call the advantadge of ground good order and military discipline be such that trough the conduction of prudent and brave comaunderes small number often time repulse far great number and some time the situation and disposition of ground-so faulethe out that neither of the 4. form of squadrone can serve wherefore a sardgent mayor or whosoever undertakethe to by curious or perfect in this art aught to be expert in frame all sort of batteles as well of equal and inequal number whatesoever wherefore I teach fit to set down the rule for the frame of such batteles bigininge with a battle of so much and one haulf more in front then in flank which the italian call metcho which I suppose to by frame of 507. arm pike and that the front thereof contain so much and the one haulf more in front then in the flank to work the which put down the number propound which be 507. pike unto which number add the one haulf of the self number which will be 253 ^/2. that do add both number and it will a month to 760 2/1. out of which take the square root which will by 27. and 21. remain and say that 27. be the front of the battle to find out the flank take 507. the number of pike and divide it by 27. the front the quotient thereof will be 18. and 21. pike remain and say that 18. be the flank and the 21. pike which do remain out of your last division will serve to guarnishe the culoure so that 27. be the front and 18. the flank which come to the just proportion of the form and number propound to see if yove have do well multiply 27. the front by 18. the flank the product of which multiplication and the 21. which do remain in your last division and if it agrie with the number of pike propound yove have do well if not yove err advertise that the proportion of the front and flank must be observe the form whereof yove shall see here follow and line proportional every way with the 312. muskete as yove more plain may perceive by the figure followenge and by the of the same a squadron of so much and the one half more in front then in flank a squadron of so much and one third part more in front then in flank 208 pike 2 pike 42 musk 42 musk 88 musk 66 musk 12 musk remain 1 1/^ 460. some time occasion and situation may offer to frame a squadron of so much and one third part more in front then in flank which the Spaniarde Caule which I suppose to be of 460. souldiere of the which 210. be pike and 250 muskete and consider that asargent mayor or any perfect soldier ought not to be ingnorant in the frame of all sort of squadrone as time occasion and situation shall require wherefore I teach fit to set down the rule for the frame of any such or semblable sort of batteles now biginenge with the above number to work the which first take the propound number of 210. pike that do divide it by 3. the quotiente whereof will by 70. this 70. the 3 part of the propound number to it the propound number of pike and it will be 280. out of which take the square root which will be 16. and 24. remainenge and say that 16. be the front of your battle that do to find out the flank divide 210. the propound number of pike by 16. the front the quotiente whereof will be 13. and two pike remainenge and say that 13. be the flank and 16 the front and two pike remain to see of you have do well multiply the front by the flank add to the producte of your multiplication the remainder and if it agrie with your propound number of pike it go well now for the devition of your propound number of short which be 250. muskete take the whole number of short and pike which be 460. and divide the same by 3. which quotient you shall find to by 153. and one remain now these 153. the quotiente of your last division of the propound number of 460. the producte of which 2. aditione will by 613. that don take the square root of 613. which will by 24. the front of the number now to find out the flank take your principal number of pike and shot which be 460. which you be to divide by 24. the square root of 613. and the number in the quotiente will be 19 and 4. remain and say that 24. be the front and ^9 the flank that do deduct 13. the flank of your squadron of pike out of 19 the last flank and there shall remain 6. this 6. divide into two part and yove shall find 3. in each part and say that the first division of shot be 14. rank of 3. muskete in each rank comprehend one rank of 3. muskete for the line of the culoure of the right flank of your squadron of pike and say that the leifte flank or side of your battle of pike be to be line with the self same order I mean 14. rank of 3. muskete in each rank so be the two flank of your battle of pike proportional line with muskete now to find out the shot that will line the front and rearward of your battle of pike deduct 84. muskete the line shoot of the two flank out of 250. the full number of shot and there will remain 166. muskete these 166. divide by 22. the full front of your pike of the two linge the quotient of which will be 7. this 7. divide into two part the one will be 4. and the other of 3. and say that the guarnison of muskete that be to line the front be 22. rank of 4 muskete in each rank and 22 rank of 3. muskete for the linenge of the rearward so be your battle proportional guarnish or line every way vertisinge that 12. muskete remain out of your division which will serve for to the culoure so with this observation and rule you may divide your shot of any other such semblable battle advertise that two pike which do guarnish the culoure be above the number the division of the battle yield which at jest be to be take out of some rank for that inescusable purpose to the culoure as also to be reckon but once in their first division so that in all squadrone when in the of their pike and shot shall not rest the convenient number require for the due line of the culoure then of force must that number be take out of some part of the battle advertise that this number so take be not to be reckon but once and that be where their first division sheow as declare in the table of the battle which be the true observation and explication of the both of the pike and shot so be it to by understand that the number take out of thigh for the colour the battle shall contain so many above the number alue in their first division and so for not to err the of the table be to be observe for bienge infallible and for cause that most common of force order and array must be break to orderly place the culor in the centre as also to guarnish they with the conveniente pike and shot a squadron of two time more in front then in flank to find out the front and flank of any number of pike which yove will have to be two time more broad then long or more in front then in flank which I suppose at this instant to be 1008. of the which 520. be pike and 488. muskete first take the propound number of pike which be 520^ and multiply the same by 2. the producte will by 1040. now out of this producte take the square root which will be 32 and 16. remain and say that 32. be the front of your battle of pike now to find out the flank take the propound number of pike which be 520. this 520. divide by 32. the front and the number in the quotient will be 16. and 8. pike remain so yove find out the front and flank meaning that 32. be the front and 16 the flank and 8. pike remain in your last division which will serve to guarnish the culoure with the observation of this rule yove may frame a battle of pike either of small or great number and of whate form yove will have the same to contain of 3. time 4. time or 5. time more in front then in flank in multiply the propound number of pike by the proportion thereof if yove will have it contain 3. time more in front then in flank multiply your propound number of pike by 3. if yove will have it to contain 4. time more in front then in flank multiply it by 4. and in wourkinge as before teach yove shall find out the front and flank and there just proportion for the impalinge shoot I have speak of in other form of squadrone but for such as will be curious and expert be require great consideration to be have for the several sort of of shot as time occasion and situation shall require and it be most necessary for he that undertakethe this charge in hand to by expert in arithmetic and so with continual practice shall he with great facility bring to just perfection all the befitenge for this purpose and let none be ingnorante but that for the several and rare curiosity of the of shot be require much practice and special in aritmeticke which be the principal fundament in reducenge these devisione into there just perfection always consider of time occasion and situation as also of afore cast prevention against the stratagem and ordere of your enemy a squadron square of man of 3024. souldiere of the which 1764. be pike and 1260. muskete divide into several maniple and troop to march that they may fall into battle present when occasion be offer as by the figure and follow set down and for such as have not intere into the deep judgement and practice of this art I will here set down the order of there first take the propound number of pike which be 1764. out of the which take the square root which will by 42. the which be the front and flank of your pike that don take the full number of your shot which be 1260 and divide this by 42. the flank of the propound number of pike and the number in the quotient will by 30. that don divide 30 the quotient into two equal part and you shall find the half thereof to be 15 so say that 15. shot come under the shelter of each pike of your flank for the guarnison of the same I mean to each of the two flank for trial whereof multiply 42. the flank of the pike by the quotient of your last devition which be 30. and the producte will by the just number of shot propound and that you may the more easy perceive these devisione I will set they down in brief as here follow you may see so be the pike and shot of the vanguard divide and the rest of your shot and pike be divide as follow if you will have the one haulf of your shot to march by themselves in the vanguard of the pike as common many do you may with ease and brevety in observe the same and without break of any rank in only comandinge that the first 3 of shot do march in the vanguard and then cause all the of pike to follow observenge there order as before set down plasinge the culore in the centre and after they in therergarde to march the other 3. of shot which be for the line of the liefte flank and observe their order as before speak of 1764 pike 1260 musk 3024. man by the figure follow you see the say fall out of their march in to battle and proporsional line on the two flank with the 1260. muskete as by the of the same and the figure follow you may see as the table of the of the battle hire follow sheow you shall understand that in the division of the pike there do remain nothing and for bienge inescusable to the culoure with pike and shot i cut of the front of the battle one rank which contain 42. pike and 30. muskete of thigh pike 20. shall guarnishe the two flank of the culoure and the other 22 pike shall by employ for other purpose and the 30. muskete with other 30. that be to be take out of the battle shall the culoure so for such as for curiosity will confronte this rekoninge it be necessary they know the diference be that 60. muekete be to by take out of the battle to guaruish the culoure as before declare which be to be reckon but once for otherwise there shall by 30. muskete diference 1764 pike 1260 muskete 3024 man table of the battle 210 muskete 294 pike 294 pike 210 muskete 294 pike 210 muskete 210 muskete 294 pike 294 pike 210 muskete 294 pike 210 muskete 3024 man square of men. 3024. man front of the battle 1764 pike 1260 musk 3024. a battle square of man which ocupy place of 694. man in which battle go avoid centre which ocupy ^oume of 49. man appoint for the safety of hurt man and amunitione or for unarmed man and baggage the empty centre for hurteman ammunition and baggage ocupy please of 49. in front and allsoe in flank who front and flank be 7. the division of the 352 muskete of the siyed squadron to line the battle proportional every way shall be divide in this manner follow the rule both for this division as also for the of the dry pike and corselete I will set down after this table of the battle I do not doubpte but many who have not long practise in the frame of squadrone and that be not skilful in the several of the same and in particular such as be not able in arithmetic will in the begin find great difficulty in well order and dividinge in proportion these batteles with centeres and line every way proporsional with sundry sort of weapon wherefore I teach fit to set down in write the manner of they re several to work the which yove must bigin with the centre then with the of your unarmed and arm pike and then with the of your shot to see how they fall to line the squadron of pike in proportion as hire follow to work the which first bigin with 49. your propound number for the void centre and demand for the square root of 49. which be 7. so you find that 7. be the front and flank of the void centre that do say that your void place or centre ocupy 21. foot in front and 49. in flank than place down 49. the centre and 121. the unarmed pike which two adisione will amont to 170. out of which take the square root which be 13. and say that 13. be the front of the unarmed pike with the void centre that do subtract 7. the front of the centre out of 13. the front of the centre and unarm and you shall find that 6. remaniethe this 6 divide by 2 and the quotient will be 3. so say that by your division you find that 3. unarmed pike come to the linenge of the centre every way beginenge first with the right flank of the centre which be 7. and say the linenge of pike of that flank be 7. rank of 3 pike in each rank and just so many more rank for the linenge of the flank of the centre conteinenge 21. pike in each linenge so by your division you fowde the 2. linenge of pike of the 2. flank of the centre now say 7. the front of the centre and 6 the 2. linenge of the same make 13. the front of the centre and 2. line now say that the third maniple of unarmed pike that shall line the front of the centre and the 2. linenge of the same shall march with 13. rank of 3. dry pike in each rank so the 2. flank and front of the centre be line that do say that the 4. maniple of unarmed pike be to be divide into 13. rank of 3. pike in each rank for to line the rergarde of the void centre and say that the centre be proportional line every way with the unarmed pike and that one unarmed pike do remain in your last division now to divide the arm pike to line the unarmed proportional every way take the full number of the centre of the unarmed and arm pike propound which 3. partisione do amonthe 342. that don take the square root of this number which will be 18 and rest 18. of the which 17. be arm pike and 1. unarmed now subtract the square root 13. out of the square root 18. and there shall rest 5. this 5. divide and say that 3 come to line one way and 2. arm pike the other side of your unarmed pike then say that the first division of arm pike that shall line the right flank of the unarmed must march with 13. rank of 3. arm pike in each rank which do amonth to 39 so say that the right flank of the unarmed be line with corselete now in the second division of corselete shall march 13. rank of 2. arm pike or corselete in each rank to line the leifte flank of the unarm as by your division so fall out now say that the 2 flank of the unarmed pike be line with the corselete then in the three division of the corselete shall march 18. rank of 3. corselete in each rank for the linenge of the full front of the unarmed pike and centre that do cause the four division or maniple of corselete to march with 18. rank of 2. corselete in each rank for the linenge of the rergarde of the battle so say that the void centre be proportional line with the unarmed pike and the unarmed with the corselete and that there do rest 18. pike which shall serve to the colour in the centre advertise that 17. be corselete and 1. unarmed pike all which you order as by the figure follow apeer now to divide your propound number of shot which be 352 muskete take the full number of the centre of the arm and unarmed pike as also of the muskete which will amonte 694 out of which take the square root which will by 26. out of which substract 18 the square of the centre of the arm and unarmed pike and there shall rest 8. this 8 divide into two part and each part will by 4 and say that to the right flank of the squadron of pike you be to march with 18. rank of 4. muskete in each rank and with just so many more shall you guarnishe or line the leifte flank of the full number of pike now to find out the line shoot of the front and rearward say that adinge to 18. the front of the pike 8 of the two linenge of the two flank it make 26. and then say that to the full front you be to march with 26. rank of 4 muskete in each rank which be the line shoot of the front and just so many more rank shall guarnishe the rearward of the battle of pike meaning 26. rank of 4. muskete in each rank and so be your battle proportional line every way as the figure and follow sheowethe a squadron square of man with a void centre front of the battle table of the battle a battle square of man frame of six and who they shall un confuse fall into battle with grace and brevity dividinge to each nation his part of the vanguard acording the number of man they give in relasion as by the figure follow be orderly divide to fall into battle of a sudden without any cross or confusion with the ensign of each nation in the centre of their pike the enemy aproachinge and understand that they be resolve to give battle the camp master general know of the prudent brave conduction and resolute determination of the Spaniard Italian irish english Borgonones and Valones command that there shall be choose out of these to the number of 10000 of choose man of try valour and full resolution givenge order that a battle square of man shall be frame of the say 10000 man and for fear of confusion or controversy in time of fall into squadron he give the order that the Italianes shall follow the spaniard the irish to follow the Italianes the english to follow the irish the Borgonones after the inglishe and the Valones to follow the Burgonones and that each nation shall follow one another as before declare with the front and flank that touch each nation acording to the number of man they give in ralation that with grace and brevity and without any cross or confusion each nation may fall into squadron of a sudden and that each nation may have his part of the vanguard acording to the number of man he givethe in relation to work the which I teach fit to set down the rule for the of these as here follow first take the full number of pike give in relation by the say six which be 5500. out of which take the square root which be 74. the front and flank of the battle and 24. pike remain which shall serve to guarnishe the culoure that do bigin to guarnishe or line the two flank of the battle of pike with short aleowinge five shot under the shelter or defence of each pike which be the most that can convenient be defend under the same to find out the linenge shoot of the right flank of the battle of pike as before ordain multiply 74. the flank by 5. and the producte will by 370. and say that the linenge shoot of the right flank be 74. rank of 5 muskete in each rank and say that the right flank of the battle of pike be line with shot to guarnishe or line the leifte flank of the battle of pike also say that it be 74. rank of 5. muskete in each rank which make 370. muskete and say that your two flank of the battle of pike be line now to know the short that shall guarnishe the full front of the pike and of the two line of the 2. flank 10. the muskete of the 2. line to 74. the front of the pike and it make 84. the full front then say that the division of shot that shall line or guarnishe the full front be to march with 84. rank of five muskete in each rank and just so many more rank shall march in the fourte division of shot that shall guarnish the full front of the rearward advertise that each division of the two last that line the front and rearward contain 420. muskete in each so that the full number of shot of the afore say 4. that shall line the two flank front and rearward do a mount to 1590. muskete comprehend 10. muskete for to guarnish the colour these 1590. muskete deduct out of the propound and full number of muskete which be 4500. and there shall remain 2910. muskete which I divide into 30. troop which come to 97. muskete in each troop the which 30. troop be divide in the 4. angle and two flank of the battle as by the figure and follow you may better perceive where all be order and set down and with as great facility as the can affourde that there by such as be not expert in aritmeticke nor in the theoric and practic of this art may the soon conceive the same the full number of shot of the say six mont out of which be to be deduct the of the 4. linenge so that after deductinge the linenge shoot of the 4. of the battle of pike rest 2910. m. which be divide into 30. troop at 97 m. in each troop which be divide in the 4 angle and two flank of the battle of pike as by the figure and follow order and proportional divide advertise that out of one of the troop of muskete of the angle you be to take 10. muskete to guarnishe the the of the pike and the order wherewithe each nation shall march to fall into battle with grace and brevety after line your squadron of pike proportional every way as before declare the 4. guarnitione of shoot 1590. muskete which be to be substract out of the principal some or number of muskete which be 4500. there shall remain 2910. muskete this remainder divide into 30. troop and you shall find by your division each troop to contain 97. muskete order and divide in the four angle and two flank of the battle of pike to skirmish acording as time occasion and situation shall require as by the figure follow you may see who all thief do fall out of there march into aperfect squadron in the form and manner as before declare and set down advertise that out of the last troop of muskete on the liefte angle of the battle must by take 10. muskete for the line shoot of the culoure so that troop of muskete contain but 87. muskete and all the rest 97. so that 10. musketh difer advertise that the culoure of each division of pike shall march in the centre of the same so that when occasion shall offer they may with grace and brevity fall into battle array and without any cross or confusion nor cut of rank nor order as many do but unconfuse with grace and brevetie fall into battle as by the figure follow you may see the 10. muskete you take out of one of the troop of the angle for to guarnish the culoure be to by reckon in their due place as the of shot sheow and you be not to reckon they in the battle by reason they be borrow out of one of the troop of muskete and let none by ignorant that when the conveniente number of pike and shot do not remain out of the to guarnish the culoure then of force order and array must be break in cutinge the shot and pike necessary to guarnish they and so for not to err in the reckon the of the table of the battle be to by observe for be infallible and for bienge the producte of the general rule of all the of the battle so be it to be under stand that their be no better sure nor rule for this purpose by the figure follow and by the table and of the same you may see who each nation do march with the front and flank acording the number of man they give in relasion advertise that the culoure of each nation be to march in the cinter of their division of pike and the 74 rank of pike of 2 pike in rank that do remain out of the of the say 6 shall close up on the leifte flank of the battle of pike as be the figure and follow you may plain see who orderly out of there march they fall unto battle with grace and brevity front of the battle square of men. advertise that out of one of the troop of muskete be to be take 10. muskete with the other 10. that do remain to guarnish the culoure still observe the of the table for be infallible the great battle of 10000 man before speak of be now divide into three battle square of man as by the figure follow appear of the then thousand man before speak of and of which be frame abattell square of man and all reduse into one body as before set down and the form of there now suppose that the campe-master general will have the self same number of 10000 man to be divide into three batteles square of man and to observe such good order in there that with grace and brevity and without any cross or confusion they may fall out of there march into battle as by the and figure follow you may see advertise that of the spaniard and Italianes there shall by frame one squadron and of the irish and english another and of the Borgonones and Valones a other now to our pupose take the full number of pike of the spaniard and Italianes which be 1928. pike out of which take the square root which will by 43. and 79. pike remainenge consider that 79. pike be much to remain out of the squadron divide 79 by 43. the square root and the number in the quotiente will by one and 36. pike yet remain this one you find out of 79. add it to 43. and it will by 44. and 36. pike remain and say that 44. be the front of the battle of pike and 43 the flank now consider that hardly above 4. shot can by convenient defend under the shelter and defence of the pike and say that you will line your battle of pike proportional by 4. muskete every way this resolution take multiply 43. the flank of the battle of pike by 4. muskete the linenge shoot the producte whereof will by 172. muskete for the line shoot of the right flank of your battle of pike and just so many more for the line shoot of the leifte flank of the battle of pike that do 8. the linenge shoot of the two flank to 44 the front of the battle of pike which two aditione make 52. the full front of the pike and 2. linenge of the two flank now to guarnishe the front of the battle of pike multiply 52. by 4. the producte whereof will by 208. muskete which be the number of shot that shall guarnishe the front of the battle meaning 52. rank of 4. muskete in each rank that do say that the two flank and front of the battle be line with shot now to guarnishe the rearward of the battle observe the self same order and number where with you do guarnishe the front of the battle which be 52. rank of 4. muskete in each rank and with so many shall you guarnishe the reward of the battle and say that your battle be proportional line every way with shot now for the division of the rest of your shot take 1620. muskete the full number of shot propound out of which deduct 760. muskete the girdle shoot of the 4. of your battle and there shall remain 860. muskete which I divide into 14. troop of 60. muskete in each troop of the which one troop shall contain 74. muskete by reason the division so fall out and divide on the two flank of the battle as by the and figure follow aperethe which be the first battle of the three and on the right hand advertise that in the last division of shot there do remain 6. muskete where with you may guarnish the coulore with they and with the 36. pike that do remain out of the division of your pike so your propound number of pike and shot be divide advertise that the front of this battle be 44. and the flank 43. multiplienge the one by the other and adinge there unto 36 pike that do guarnishe the make the propound number of pike which be 1928. as by the follow apeerethe advertise that you be to cut ten muskete that want for the guarnision of the culoure out of one of the troop which you shall find to much in the battle be reason they be borrow of one of the troop so follow the as they be set down in the table which be the right way and infallible table of the first battle the second battle now that yove have do with the number of pike and shoot the spaniard and Italianes give take the 3286 man which be give in relation be the irish and english of the which 1786 be pike and 1500. muskete to reduce they into a perfect squadron square of man and to be proportional line and guarnish every way with shot to work the which first take the number of pike which be 1786. out of which take the square root which will by 42 and there shall remain 22. pike which may be employ to guarnishe the that do say that 42 be the front and flank of the battle of pike and 22. pike remain and suppose that occasion offer that you find necessary the line shoot not to pass 3. in rank under the shelter and defence of apike now to find out the line shoot of the right flank of your battle of pike multiply 42. the flank of the pike by 3. muskete that be aleow for the linenge shoot the producte whereof will by 126. or 42. rank of 3. muskete in each rank then say the right flank of the pike be line with shot and just so many more rank of shot shall serve for the line of the leifte flank of the battle of pike observe the self same number and order as do the linenge shoot of the right flank of the battle of pike which be 42. rank of 3. muskete in each rank which mont to 126. muskete now to guarnish the front of the battle of pike which be 42. add thereunto the two line which 3. aditione will by 48. the full front of the pike and of the two line which you shall multiply by 3. the producte whereof will by 144. muskete or 48. rank of 3. muskete in each rank so the two flank and front of the battle of pike be proportionable line now to guarnish the rearguard of the battle of pike with shot observe the self same order before set down for the line of the front of the pike that be to say 48. rank of 3. muskete in each rank so your battle of pike be proportional line every way that don substract the 540. muskete the linenge shoot of the two flank front and rearward out of the principal number of shot which be 1500 and there shall rest 960. muskete which you shall divide by 12. or into 12 troop and the quotiente of your division alowethe 80. muskete in each troop which yove may double when occasion require that do say that the rest of your shot be divide into 12. troop of 80. muskete in each troop to be divide on the two flank of the battle of pike to squirmish in single or double siele as occasion and situation shall require so all your pike and shot be divide advertise that the 22. pike that do remain out of the division of the pike be to guarnish the coulore as by the follow you may see advertisenge that by reason no muskete do remain out of the you be to cut of one of the troop 12. muskete to guarnish the coulore which be not to be reckon in the body of the battle but for borrow but where the fall and sheow which be the right way as here under you see in the table which be unfalible table of the second battle the third battle now to frame the third battle of the 3166. man the Borgonones and Valones give in relation meaning 1786. pike and 1380. muskete first take the propound number of pike which be 1786. out of which take the square root which yove shall find to be 42. so that 42. be the front and flank of the battle and 22. pike remain which shall serve to guarnishe the culoure put in case that occasion require that your linenge shot be to be no more than 3. muskete in rank and say that 42. rank of 3. muskete in each rank shall guarnishe the right flank of the battle of pike and just so many more for the linenge of the leifte flank which two linenge make 252. muskete that do take 42. the front of the pike and add thereunto 6. the linenge shoot of the two flank which two aditione will make 48. to guarnishe the front of your battle of pike say that the third division of shot be 48. rank of 3. muskete in each rank and just so many more rank for the linenge shoot of the rearward of the battle of pike observe the self same order as do the third division of shot meaning 148. rank of 3. muskete in each rank which two for the linenge shoot of the front and rearward make 288 muskete and so the 4. side of your battle of pike be proportional line every way the four linenge importh 540. muskete that don substract 540. muskete out of the full number of shot which be 1380. and there shall remain 840. muskete which yove shall divide as time occasion or situation shall require which now I suppose conveniente to be divide into twenty troop to be divide on the two flank of the battle of pike to skirmish where occasion shall require in single or double fiele as the situation shall permit and the occasion shall require at 42. muskete in each troop so all your shot and pikas be divide as before declare advertise that the culoure shall march in the centre guarnish with the 22 pike that do remain in the division of the pike and by reason no shot do remain out of the of your shot yove may take 12. shot out of the last division of shot to guarnishe the culoure so your three battle be frame and by the figure follow you see how out of there they fall into battle great consideration and curiosity be to by understand for the several of shot as time and occasion shall require always consider the situation and disposition of the ground as also of the several and advantadge in skirnmishenge with great or small troop with single or double file and in whate distance when the enemy do abound on horse and when not and also in prevent in due time the ordere and stratagem of the enemy let none by ingnorante that when in the of pike and shot their rest not enough to guarnish the culoure of force the necessary shot and pike require for that purpose be to be cut of the wing or troop of the flank and be to be reckon where their first do fall as declare in the table of the battle for if you reckon they in the battle and where their first division do fall it can not confronte with the so observe still the rule of the as set down and declare in brief in the table of the battle which be the right way and general rule this table be neowlie invent for that purpose where present without any pain or trouble you shall find the reason and proportion of all the of the batteles in brief as well of the shot as of the pike as also whate remain out of the which table be of rare importance for the brief explicatinge and order of all the of battle and beside for cause that many do leave the same in obscurity to avoid prolixity as also to disperte the ingeniouse understand of those of perfection in this art square of men. front of the second battle front of the first battle front of the third battle a squadron square of ground of 1116. souldiere of the which 576. be pike and 540. muskete to reduce they into aperfecte squadron square of ground first take the propound number of pike which be 576. which you shall multiply by 3. the producte whereof will be 1728 this producte divide by 7. and the number in the quotient will by 246. out of this 246. take the square root which will by 15. and say that you find out the flank of the battle of pike now to find out the front of the battle take the propound number of pike which be 576. which you shall divide by 15. the flank the quotiente whereof will by 38. which be the front of the battle of pike and there rest 6. pike which shall serve to guarnish the coulore so that 38. be the front and 15. the flank now for the division of your 540. muskete first say that for the girdle shoot of the right flank of the battle of pike must march 16. rank of 5. muskete in each rank comprehend the rank of the culor so the first division of shot of the van be divide into 16. rank of five muskete in eacheranke and the second division of shot of the vanguard and first wing of the right flank of the battle of pike be divide into 19 rank of 5. muskete in each rank the third division or wing of the vangarde be also divide into 19 rank of 5. muskete in each rank which shall serve for the second wing of shot of the vanguard and right flank of the battle of pike so that 270. muskete the just haulf of the propound number of shot be comprehend in the say 3. of shot of the vanguard and right flank of the battle of pike and for the girdle shoot and two wing of the leifte flank of the battle of pike be also leave just so many more which shall observe the self same order in linenge the leifte flank of the pike imeane 16. rank of five muskete in each for the girdle shoot of the leifte flank of the battle of pike and 2. slive of 19 rank of 5. muskete in each rank in which 6. be comprehend the full number of shot which be 540. muskete advertise that the first three of shot shall march before the pike and the other three of the rergarde and leifte flank shall march after the pike as by the follow set down in brife and shall be better understand by such as be not expert in this art so that they may the soon conceive and come to understand these and how out of there march they fall into battle with grace and brevity without any crossinge confusion or break of rank as many do which be not expert in aritmetike nor in the several sort of of fiery the say 1116. souldiere be divide into ten as before declare and who out of there march they shall fall in battle either in singell or double fiele as occasion shall require and the situation and disposition of the ground shall permit advertise that there do remain 6. pike for to guarnishe the and that in the of the lininge shot and rank of the coulore be comprehend 2. rank of shot and that each one of the 4. wing do contain 3. rank more than the of the girdle shoot and that for cause that ordinary the wing be augment with 3.4 or 5. rank more than the girdle shoot front of the battle to frame a squadron square of ground of 2782. souldieres of the which number 1050. be pike and 1732. muskete to reduce this number into a squadron square of ground which the spanniarde caulle first take the propound number of pike which be 1050. and multiply it by 3. the producte whereof will by 3150. this producte divide by 7. and the number in the quotient will be 450. out of this quotiente take the square root which you shall find to be 21. and 9 remain and say that 21. be the flank of the propound number of pike now to find the front of the battle take the full number of pike which be 1050. which yove shall divide by 21. the flank and the quotient will be 50. and remain nothing and say that 50. be the front of the battle of pike and 21 the flank now for the division of your shot suppose that yove will have the line shoot not to contain more than 4. in rank and that yove will have the battle of pike to be proportional line every way with shot to work the which take 21. the flank of the battle of pike and multiply it by 4. the producte whereof will by 84. and say that the first division of shot be 84. muskete or 21. rank of 4. muskete in each rank which be the linenge shoot of the right flank of the battle of pike and the second division of shot for the linenge of the leifte flank shall contain just so many more now to find out the number of shot that shall be in proportion to guarnish the full front of the battle of pike and of the two linenge to 50. the front of the propound number of pike 8 the number of shot of the two linge which two aditione will make 58. and say that 58 rank of 4. muskete in each rank shall be the guarnison or linenge shoot of the front of the battle of pike and of the 2 linenge and just so many more for the guarnison of the rearward of the battle of pike meaning as before declare 58. rank of 4. muskete in each rank so the two flank front and rearward of the battle of pike be proportional line every way with 640. muskete and rest 1092. muskete which I divide into 22. troop or maniple order and divide in the front rergarde and 4. angle of the battle of pike to skirmish either in single or double fiele as time occasion and situation shall require and permit all which you may see by the figure follow for the of shot let none be ingnorante but that there be many and curiosity to be have as time and occasion shall require and especial if the enemy be superior on horse hire follow who the full number of pike and shot be divide into 31. and who out of they re march they fall into battle advertise that of one of the troop of muskete on the angle of the battle be to by take 8. muskete which want to guarnish the culoure be reason no muskete do remain in their last division also be reason no pike do rest in the division of the pike cut 21. pike of the flank to guarnishe the culoure so the front of the battle of pike shall by but 49. pike and by reason the be before shut up thigh 8 muskete difer in the rekoninge so that when aconv eniente number of pike and shot do not remain out of the suficiente to guarnish the culoure the above observation mu ste be keep as order in the table of the battle so to confronte the with the propound number yove be to by inform by the table for bienge infallible a battle of 2025. souldiere divide into five battle square of ground of the which number 945. be pike and 1080 muskete which be equal divide into five batteles and proportional line with the propound number of shot which be 1080. muskete as the and figure follow sheowethe to work the which first take the propound number of pike which be 945 and divide it into five part or by five and the number in the quotiente will by 189. which be the just number of pike your division yealdethe for each battle of the five now to find out the front and flank of each battle take 189. pike which your division alowethe for each battle of pike and multiply the same by 3. the producte whereof will by 567. this producte divide by 7. and the number in the quotient will by 81. out of this 81. the quotiente take the square root which will by 9 and say that 9 be the flank of each one of the five batteles of pike now to find the front take the propound number of pike which your division do allow to each battle of pike which be 189. this 189 pike divide by 9 the flank the quotiente whereof will by 21. and nothing remain and say that 21. pike be the front and 9 the flank of each battle of pike before speak of and when yove will have they fall into squadron let they march in 3. maniple of 9 rank of 7. pike in each rank with the colour in the centre of the midel maniple and so shall they fall with grace and brevity into battle and without any crosinge or confushion to guarnishe the colour yove may cut nine pike of the flank of each battle and so shall the front contain but 20. pike now for the division of the propound number of shot which be 1080. muskete suppose that yove will have each battle of pike to be proportional line alowinge 3. muskete under the shelter or defence of the pike first say that the first division of shot that shall girdle the right flank of the first battle of pike shall contain 9 rank of 3. muskete in each rank and just so many more for the girdle shoot of the leifte flank so be the 2. flank of the battle of pike guarnish now to guarnishe the front of the battle of pike with shot say that 21. be the front of the battle of pike and adinge thereunto the two line it make 27. and say that the three division of shot be to march with 27. rank of 3. muskete in each rank which shall guarnishe the full front of the battle of pike and two line now the two flank and front of the battle of pike be guarnish and guarnish the rearward of the battle of pike observe the self same order as yove do in guarnishinge the front of the battle of pike which be 27. rank of 3. muskete in each rank so your battle of pike be proportional line every way as before declare the self same order shall by observe for the linenge and girdle shoot of the other four batteles of pike as more plain shall a peer by the and figure follow by the above mention four you see who the first battle of pike be proporsional guarnish with shot which 4. make 216. muskete and the self same order shall be observe to guarnishe each one of the other four battle of pike which make up 1080 muskete the propound number for the five batteles as you may plain see by the figure follow how they fall out of there march and into battle as before declare advertise that in the of the pike and shot there do remain nothing front of the second battle front of the first battle front of the third battle front of the fifthe battle front of the four battle advertise that no pike nor shot do remain out of the to guarnishe the culoure so that one rank of pike and shot may by cut all a long the front or flank of each battle to guarnish the culoure consider that cross batteles be of wonderful force as well aganiste horse as foot as also for the safeguard of baggage amunitione and hurteman I toughte necessary to put down the rule for the frame of such fort of batteles put in case that you have 2032. souldiere of the which 1000 be pike and 1032. be muskete and that you woul have this number divide into four battle of broad front proporsional line every way with the propound number of shot to work the which first take the number of pike which be 1000 and divide the same by 4. or into four part and the quotiente will by 250. which be the number of pike that your division yield for each of the 4. batteles of pike now to frame the first battle take 250. pike and divide the same by 3. the quotient will by 83. of which 83. take the square root which be 9 and say that 9 be the flank of the battle now to find out the front take 250. the number of pike and divide the same by 9 the flank the quotient will by 27. and 7. pike remain and say that 27. be the front and 9 the flank and 7. pike remain so yove find out the front and flank of each battle of the 4. and 7. pike remain in each battle which shall serve to guarnishe the now for the division of your shot take the propound number of shot which be 1032 muskete and divide the same by 4. or into 4. part and the number in the quotiente will by 258. which be the just number of shot your division yealdethe for each battle of the 4. of pike that do take the number of pike and shoot that each battle do contain which be 508. this full number divide by 3. the quotient whereof will be 169. out of which take the square root which will by 13. the flank now to find the front of the full number of pike and shot take 508. and divide it by 13. the flank and the quotiente will be 39 and 1. remain now take 10. the flank of the pike comprehend the linenge of the culor and substract it out of 13. the last flank of the full number of pike and shot and there shall remain 3. and say that the first division of shot shall march with 10. rank of 3. muskete in each rank which shall serve for the girdle shoot of the right flank of the first battle of pike and just so many more for the linenge shoot of the leifte flank so the two flank of the battle of pike be line now to guarnishe the front of the battle of pike 6 the 2. linenge to 27. the front of the pike which two aditione make 33. and say that the third division of shot shall march with 33. rank of 3. muskete in each rank and just so many more rank of muskete shall march to guarnish the rearward of the battle of pike and two linenge so the four side of the battle of pike be proportional line every way and the self same order shall be observe for the of each battle of the other three as the figure and follow sheowethe these cross batteles be esteem to be of wonderful force consider well the frame of they and they be also of wonderful safeguard for the baggage amunitione and hurteman and if the enemy do come to charge on the first battle or on any of the other outward batteles which be alone be but of little force but the two outward batteles march upon both side of the first than it be of triple force and if the enemy do charge on the rearward of the two alone batteles they close to gither and be of double force and if the enemy be strong on horse and shall charge at once on the front and rearward then the baggage and hurteman be to march betwixt the two double batteles of the vangarde and rearward and cut so many pike as shall guarnish the same on both side to keep of the fury of the horse so it be guarish every way as the and figure follow sheowethe by reason the culoure be double line and that yove must cut 6. muskete for each battle in the rekoninge shall so many it import nothing be reason yove be to observe the general rule of the table which be infallible front of the first battle front of the third battle front of the second battle front of the four battle by reason that by the the conveniente number of shot do not rest for the line of the culoure the 6. shot that want for that purpose in each of the four battle be to by take out of some of the so that thigh 6. muskete borrow shall difer but for not to err in the reckon always observe the (...) of the di^isiones as set down in the table for be infallible and that most common to much or to little pike and shot be wont to remain for the line of the culoure so that the first order in the table be the right way for otherwise such as be not curious and of rare judgement can not choose but err in the reckon and so for to remedy of this confusion and obscure reckon always observe the divivisione of the table for be infallible by reason that the convenient number of pike and shot do not remain out of the you may cut one rank alongste the flank or front to guarnish the culoure table of the cross battle several ordere be use for the repartinge and prudent order of a army into sundry battalone as the and judiciouse intendiment of the prudent and brave comaunder shall find conveniente in devidinge they into 3.6.8.12 or 16 battalone which with facility be order by the prudent and experiment Sardgente mayor a army of 19200. divide into 16. battalone of broad front bienge divide by 16. each battle shall contain 1200. who front be 60. and flank 20. as by the figure follow yove see order the army divide into 16 batteles of broad front 16. batteles the self same army of 19200. be divide into 12. battalone of broad front yove shall by your division find each battalon to contain 1600. who front be 69. and flank 23. as the figure follow sheow the army divide into 12 batteles of broad front 12. batteles three thousand man divide into six battle of broad front order to fight as by the figure follow yove see the front of each battle be 41. and flank 12. and 8. remain in the division of each battallon SEverall be for the and order of the fiery weapon some use wing of 200. some 300. shot but in my opinion it be far better to divide they into small troop of 50.60.70 and so till a 100 for by experience I know the same to by of for great execution in ocasione of service and more ready either in plain straight or narrow place for the more troop of shot yove have be prudent order and conduct the more shall the enemy by a ply the one orderly secondinge the other which questionless their execution shall by far great than if they be divide into great troop when yove shall come to any narrow or straight pasadge consider whether the straight by such as will suffice that yove may pass trough the same with the order yove march if not conform the order with the pasadge and let the order not by so broad in front but that it may conveniente march without break order or array nor lesh than the third part of the front of the battle of pike if the situation so permit for cause that all prevensione possible to be have for the brief frame of battle be to by more esteem rather than fall abreakinge often time order and array as very many unable Sardgente mayore common do but rather prudent with grace and brevity and without any cross or confusion or break of any rank fall into battle thigh and many more difficulty be with facility reduce into their just perfection by prudent and brave and with grace and brevity the rule to frame triangle battle be to bigin with one man in the first rank 3. in the second 5. in the third seven in the four and so consequenty augment 2 in every rank until you finish your battle this unused proporsion I put down to content those which will fain know the form of such battle and besides that mayor ought not to by ingnorante in any manner of form or proporsione of squadrone and that with facility and speed he may change the form and proporsion as time occasion and situasion shall require and that beside occasion may offer that situasion shall present fit for such form so that a Sargente mayor ought not to by ingnorante in no form of squadrone front a battle of broad square of 6000. man of the which 1930. be complete corselete and 4070. musketeer order and divide as follow first take the propound number of pike which be 1930. this number divide be 3 the quotiente whereof will by 643. out of this quotiente take the square root which will by 25. which be the flank of the battle of pike that do to find out the front of the battle take the propound number of pike and divide the same by 25 the flank which quotient will by 76. and 30. pike remain and say that 76. be the front and 25. the flank of the battle of pike and that the 30. pike shall be to guarnishe the now for the division of the 4070. muskete put in case that yove will have the battle to be proporsional line every way with shot consider that five shot be the most that can be convenient defend under the shelter or defence of the pike and say that yove will have the battle to by guarnish with five muskete in rank to work the which take 27. the flank comprehend the two rank of the coulore and say that the first division of shot be 27. rank of five muskete in each rank which be the girdle shoot of the right flank and just so many for the linenge of the liefte flank now to find out the shot that shall guarnishe the full front of the battle of pike and the two linenge take 10. the linenge of the two flank and add it to 76. the front which two aditione make 86. and say that the guarnision of shot of the front of the battle of pike and two linenge shall march with 86. rank of five muskete in each rank now for the linenge shoot of the rearward of the battle of pike observe the self same order meaning 86. rank of five muskete in each rank so the two flank front and rearward of the battle of pike be proportional line which 4. of shoot make 1130 muskete now for the division of the rest of the shot substract 1130. the 4 line out of 4070. muskete the principal some and there shall rest 2940. muskete which can not come under the shelter nor defence of the pike which I divide into 40. maniple of 74. muskete in each maniple except one troop that contain but 54. muskete which I divide on the flank of the battle of pike to skirmish in singell or double fiele as time occasion and disposition of the ground shall permit so all your shot be divide as before set down and as by the and figure follow order and how out of there march they fall into squadron advertise that the coulore shall march in the centre and midele maniple of pike and the 30. pike that remain for to guarnishe the colour shall also march in the same maniple all which be plain order as by the figure follow yove may see who out of there march they fall into battle with grace and brevity in observe the ordain when of a sudden yove will have the pike out of there march to fall with grace and brevity into battle cause the first division of pike to march with 25. rank of 16. pike in each rank than another maniple of 25. rank of 15 pike in each rank than another maniple with the self same order with the coulore in the centre guarnish with the 30. pike that do remain after the maniple of the colour shall march two other maniple of 15. rank of 5. pike in each rank as hire folowenge yove shall see for the frame of batteles bastard square which the Spaniarde and italian call that be to say long in flank the rule which be use for the frame of these sort of batteles be the self same of the broad square and the diference be that the front of the one be flank of the other as for example suppose yove will have abattell bastard square to be frame of 700. pike to work the which do as yove do in frame the batteles of broad front in dividinge the say number of 700. pike by 3 the quotiente whereof will be 233. out of which quotiente take the square root which will by 15. which be the front of the bastard square now to find the flank take 700. the propound number of pike and divide the same by 15. the front the quotient whereof will by 46. the flank of the bastard square and rest 10. pike and if of this self same number of 700. pike yove will frame asquadron of broad square the flank of the bastard square will by the front of the broad square so that the rule which be use for the one will serve for the other the diference be that the front of the one will serve for the flank of the other a squadron of broad front front of the battle table of the battle advertise that the 20 muskete for the line shoot of the culoure be comprehend in the of the line shoot of the two flank which 20 muskee be cut of the last troop on the liefte flank which troop remain with 54 muskete and all the rest 74 muskete no soldier I hope ought to be ingnorante but that the squadron of pike be frame it be to be empald and girdeled with shot as many rank of shot as pike but the right and natural girdelinge shoot indeed ought to be no more shoot in rank then that the pike may well cover and defend espesial where the enemy be strong of horse and so under the favour of the pike there can not convenient be defend but one rank of three or four shot at the most and so many in my opinion the girdelinge shoot contain and knelinge upon one knee under the of the couch pike shall at the charge of the horseman discharge there volley in there face and bosom which will be no small gallinge unto they butt when this danger of horse be not to by fear than the impalement may be make of more shot in a rank acording to the quantity of shot and the rest of the shot into small slive or troop to troop round about the battle in reasonable distance from the same the which of small troop I esteem to be far better than the great inproportionate wing which many do use contain far great number and be much more ready to be bring to skirmish either in single or double fiele and every several troop to be lead by a Sargente or corporal and some captain to oversee the whole and at every angle of the battle it be not a miss to a point certain troop of shot which will flanker it every way even as the Cavallero or Travessos do the curtain of a fort let none be ingnorante but that for the several of pike and shot be require great as time occasion and situation shall require continual application in the theoric and practic of war together with perfection in arithmetic make easy many difficulty of deep judgement and rare importance in warlike affair all which continual use and exercise make the easy for the several of shot many be to be have acording as occasion shall require and the situation and disposition of ground shall permit for the girdelinge shoot some use three some 4. and five be the most that can convenient be defend under the shelter or defence of the pike and special when the enemy be strong on horse so that for the right guarnision of shot ought not to be more than the pike can defend but in such as the enemy be not to be fear on horse the of shot can be order of great number to skirmish acording to the judgement of the sardgente mayor dividinge they in wing or maniple as he shall think most conveniente observe their just proportion in they re some use great wing of shot which be not commendable in of fight for the small troop be more apt and easieste to by govern and of a sudden you can skirmish with they either in single or double fiele and that beside they bring more man to fight at once but when the enemy be superior on horse and we feowe or none it be good to get the 4. of the battle of equal resistance both to offend and defend so that the enemy may not take advantage of one place more than of the other the wing or maniple of shot be not to go any great distance from the battle of pike and special when the enemy be strong on horse but rather under the shelter and defence of the pike that thereby the squadron may by the strong and more safe in receive any damage when their force be unite in one body as happen to don Alvero de Sandy in the journey of caruan in barbery when the of ciderfa king of the moor charge on he one of his captain name Luis Bravo de laguna see a wing of shot a good distance from the squadron cry on do Alvero wish he with speed to turn and receive that wing for freare that for loose the same he shall incur danger to loose the body by daily experience we see that small number do repulse far great and that the army which be best order and discipline most common be master of the victory whereof there be very many example in write of famous and antiente so that these happy proceed resulte of the good order prudence and approve experience of the chief and brave comaunderes and of the resolute valour of the souldiere as Vegetio give the reason how the antiente roman come to master all other say that they be not so great as the german nor so great in number as the frence nor so prudent as the greek nor so many in number as the spanardes nor so subtle as the africane nor so furious as the britane butt by they re continual practice and experience in war they overcome all these difficulty by only mantayinge there people well exercise in arm and practice of war when a regiment do march some time great disordere be comit the souldiere runinge away from there culoure robinge and spoil the country and poor inhabitant little regard in not accomplish there in be absent from there culoure little respect or fearninge there officeres and no respect to military discipline whereof result great ruin and revolte in many country some and be culpable in these intolerable disordere offensive to the law of god and common wealth in not procure sollicitinge and daily instruct they re souldiere as a father be bind to do for his child and that as far as his ability and power can reach and not to be incline to steal or wrong the poor soldier in keep any thing wrongful from he but rather show himself very love and kind to they in equalinge himself in all dangere and travayle with they in continual give they good and comfort they in all necessity yea and in assist they to his ability in minister equity and good justice a mongste they in honour and preferenge those of brave carriage and good example that othere may imitate they in redresinge in due time disordere in see severe punish factionere whole give to vice and bad example which be more dangerous than the devil so shall he both by belove and fear by the souldiere in know that he be careful in minister and procure justice to each one acording his desert and special to see base factionere banish and severe punish when there be no hope of there amendment in of march the sardgent mayor be to take a special care to procure all thing to be in a readiness to bigin his jurney very early that the souldiere may come in good time to their quarter for many to their commodity and ease and in they re march not to opress they but keep a ordinary pace for otherwise very many shall stay behind to make all to now and then where he shall hit upon good water and he ought to have aregarde in pasinge narrow pasadge and make a distance of till they all have past and fall into there former and rank a Sardgente ought to be leifte in each division of the regiment that he may yield account of they at all time and observe the order as it be ordain by the Sargente mayor with so many rank and the self number so that with facility out of there march they may fall into squadron when occasion shall require and such a Sardgente or as trough negligence shall not acomplish his obligation to reprehend he in public in time of the roman such as be incline to disobedience in not accomplish there order and obligation they be so severe punish that no soldier dare by absent from his rank and the and of each division of they re marchinge have such care in accomplish whate be refer to there charge with such punctuality that full satisfaction be yield in extraordinary heat weather in summer when the sardgente mayor marchethe with his regiment great consideration ought to be take as before speak of by cause of the extraordinary heat and heavy burden of the soldier some time they be chockte and burn with heat and for shame and regard of there honour they rather try danger of death then stay behind there culoure when the sardgente mayor shall march with his regiment in any place or country where the enemy be to be fear the aught not to by great then that they may comodious march nor less than the third part of the squadron of pike some time with the one half and some time in battle always takeng regard of the situation and occasion the master camp in march with his regiment as chief of the same be to march in the vanguard next to who person be to assist the sardgente mayor as a principal minister to who he of his regiment but if the enemy shall chance to charge on the rearguard he as a chief conductor of his regiment be to assist in the place most to be fear of the enemy to command and execute in due time whate be most fit the sardgente mayor be in and be inform that his regiment be to march the next morrow he be to repair to the captain general of who he be to demand order where his regiment shall march in the vanguard battle of rearguard and he be to and give order to the captain to get all the baggage charge upon the a poinct hour ordain and not to fail in acomplshinge the same and if the vanguard belong to he he be to command the captain to get all thing in a redineshe at the break of day and to give order that the culoure and company of his regiment with speed draw out of the quarter and to march on to the place of arm and there to frame his squadron give order to each captain where he shall march that day and divide the and sheowe each one his division and give they straight charge that they acomplishe there obligation with care and punctuality and that no soldier do miss his rank nor break the order give if the narowne of the pasadge do not constrain he and let no soldier pass to spoil the poor inhabitant and if he want any soldier of those of his division or if any come unto they more than the order give to adverice the sardgent mayor and for recompense of his punctuality and care in accomplish his obligation he shall gain the benevolence of his master de camp and sardgent mayor and in reason they ought to have a memory of his punctual care and to prefer he into a great office for his obedience and punctuallitie a monghste other and not once nor twice but still make know his approve part care and diligence in accomplish the ordere of his so can he not by forget by the superior officer till he by advance for his undeniable care and obedience most necessary it be for a sergeant mayor to be couriouse and expert in execute well his office for in time of frame of squadrone the judge of his be many in time of frame of squadrone some sardgent mayore do fall into many by reason of there little exercise and special for not applienge themselves with care and diligence both in the theoric and practic of this art and special to by skilful in arithmetic which with practice make easy many rare occurrante in warlike affair and such as be not curious in well appleinge themselves in learning the rare and deep curiosity of this art do some time find themselves puzzle and amaze before there enemy in time of most need a most unfitinge thing it be for one to be ingnorante and unhabele in his office so I suppose that such as do not diligent apply themselves can hardly reduce into perfection that whereof he be ingnorante and know not the art by daily experience we see that favour friendship and affection hinderethe much prosperity and good success and special in this noble art of war many there be for the of shot and special when the enemy be strong on horse and that you have two third part of shot unto one of pike your battle be empald and girdeled proportional with shot there will yet remain good store of shot the question be how they shall be bestow to be safe from the fury of the horse the sure and best way be to put they into the centre of the battle of pike where they be more safe and if any shot be kill or hurt you can take at all time out of the centre as many as you shall need of for the frame of these battle with i have already declare how they ought to be frame and proporsionol line and if the enemy horse shall chance of a sudden to charge on yove and that you have no time to place the overplusse of your shot in the centre divide they betwixt the rank of pike all alongste from the front to the rear ward so they shall by safe and yove can use they at any time when occasion shall require but have intelligence that the enemy be strong in horse and we feowe or none in such i woule first bigin in frame the cener of the overplusse of the shot have opportunity for the same and also leave place for hurteman in the centre and divide they into so many maniple that they may of a sudden fall into squadron square of man in the centre without any crossinge aluenge there just front and flank and then divide the pike into maniple to proportional guarnishe the centre on every side or front of the same and then divide in proportion the girdlinge shoot that be leave to guarnish the 4 of the battle of pike and centre this be the perfect and right way but when urgent necessity require the overplusse of shot may be plase and divide betwixt the rank of pike as before set down advertise that the coulore be to go in the centre as the battle do march on towards the enemy and come once within reach of the musket then the first rank of the wing of muskete be to march in this manner the first rank steppinge some two or three pace forward have in the mean time make themselves ready and cock there match then with readiness and expedition all those of the first rank there muskete byenge upon their rest or fork to discharge at once permitenge other rank to proceed then present those of the second rank to step up before the first rank as the battle or batallon do march and so to discharge as they re former follow have do before and then the third rank before the second and the four the before the third and so all the other rank consequent with this kind of double march and at the train of the last rank those of the first to follow up a gain and so consequent the rest but if chance that the squadron of pike be distrese or constrain to retire they be to discharge at the enemy retire back upon a counter march each feel or rank consequent and with expedition one after a nother and with speed fall bake into there rank to give place to the next rank that no time be idle employ sundry there be of comparisone betwixt the infantry and cavalry which of they be most utill in the war the one and the other be most necessary in occurante of warlike affair but in my opinion the infantry be to be prefer first be well discipline in the art of war never the less the cavalier be well mont and arm and be experiment souldiere be conduct by prudent and brave douptlesse their and resolution be to be fear but they be not comparable to deal with resolute foot except upon manifest and great advantage and in place or ground of great favour for they for be well know that a resolute stand of pike well order and girdeled with shot will give they sore stop and return as plain apeered when marquis Pescara with 800 short aptayn the victory of Charles noy then visroy of Napoles with his cavalry at the battle of Pavia a nother example we have of the conte Francisco carmognolla be captain general of Filip Viconte duke of Millane army go with 6000. horse a gainste the swishere army be by they repulse by the valeure and length of their pike who have regathered this disorder troop consider from whence there disadvantage greowe turn head again upon the enemy and he himself and his company disamount on foot and with there lance in hand frame afoot squadron and charge the enemy afresh and break and overthrewe they in number above fifteen thousand when by force of horse can not by remove imitate herein Marcus Valerius Cornelius who be consul and captain against the samnite in the first punny war and in their last battle not able to enter upon they by reason of there long pike where with they defend themselves command his horseman to disamounte and on foot they arrive as they be with there lance to fight with there enemy and over throw they and put they to flight optaininge the victory and remain with there baggage and in the battle give by Constantine captain general to Sigismond king of Polonia with Basilius the great duke of Moscovia by the river Brisva who surmount he on horse back three thousand foot man only he have in his army win he that day the honour and victory also as do apeere by the memorable batteles of the inglishe against the proud cavalry of the frence at agincourte field and other place many more example may be recite both ancient and modern remember that among the antiente roman there foot be always of more estimation than there horse always hold a true opinion that the infantry well discipline be the right sinew of the war the wall of the city and fortress

have with the state foot and horse but it must by consider that those be old and experiment soldier restenge upon a resolute and valerouse determination the othere for the most bisone and raw people raise upon a sudden conceit in which be marvelouse to be mark the diference between man of experience and raw bisone the prudent carriage resolute valour and good conduction of the one and little

their duty and know who to a accomplish with their for some raw and unexperimented man do undertake the charge of a gunner who know just nothing they re ought to by instrument to take the leavelle engine to and all sort of ordnance the general of the artillery as a superior comaunder ought to procure and take a special care in due time to see all matteres provide and put in order rather than to think theruppon when occasion shall present and special in the low country where war be daily in exercise and sundry interprise and brave exploit execute of a sudden he be to get a list of all sort of amuninitione and arm as well defencive as offensive both for foot and horse give order and charge of the same to the mayor the which they ought to give out by librance or tickete from the general because that good account may by yield of of such great importance in as much that no fraud may by suspect when occasion shall offer to plant your cannon or great shot to batter a city town foot or castle or any other occasion and pretend to effect well your purpose you shall place they by 5.6 7.8 as occasion shall require a leowinge a certain distance betwixt every two piece acording as the occasion and situation shall require or permit first order the place where they shall by put with plank or table all a longste under their while a leowinge 7. foot little more or less behind they re while for the retire of the piece so that of itself or with little pain it return a gain to his due and former place and alsoe before the artillery be to by set a resistance of table betwixt it and the gabione and parapet and so of a neowe bigin to charge it and when the artillery bigine to be hot it be not to by refresh with vinegar but rather weathinge the trimer in water and with the same to refress the cane or barrel this observation be fulfil in due time you may still shoot of if occasion require it be alsoe to by consider the thickness and metal advertise that the mastere of the ordnance do a leowe no more than 40. or 50. shot a day if the occasion by not of such importance he who take this honourable charge in hand ought to by skilful in the art of war and of great care in give all orderes and in due time and see that with great care and punctuality his ordere be observe he ought to know the name of every piece and they re several weighte lenghte bigness and the just boar of the cilend the weight and thickness of they re bullet the quantity of powder necessary for every piece their best advantadge at point blank the diference and goodness of they re powder the laddel sponge and rammere necessary and befitinge for each one they re aught too by bullet and a row of wild fire it be still to by consider the goodness or badness of the powder for the powder be good the lesser will serve and be of far better execution and do less heat the piece to know who much powder you ought to a leowe to each piece take in powder the weight of the @ part of the bullet and so with all sort of ordnance of whatesoever cice as for example a cannon of 66. pound bullet require 44. pound of powder which be the @ of the weight of the bullet and so with the rest the laddell be fill two time be the right charge of each piece but that consideration ought to be take in the goodness of the powder and piece upon the powder and artillery ought always to be a point a good and vigilant watch so that no fraud may take effect in naylinge the ordnance or give fire to the powder both foot and horse ought to guard the same if need require and special good round the setinge

that they re shall want for two many good respect for the more you have always to spare of powder and other the more honour you gain and the quiet your mind if you shall chance to come to conquest a foreign country where you be well assure to get both horse and foot and be full resolve to overcome that country and remain in possession of the same it be very necessary you carry a long with you a great quantity of saddeles briddle spur and mastere to make such wourke and alsoe to carry a long with you a quantity of many sort of weapon and which suchc country can not a fourde and to take a special care that you receive no man which may by suspect for fidelity be a precious guel of great for next under God they re be nothing of so great importance to a prince as to have loyal subject for trough they re love and unity the fertility of the country a company with good law good discipline prudent and brave conduction of his captain and comaunderes in war as alsoe a company with thigh say a faithful and resolute determination of his souldiere who be exercise and experiment in war be a wonderful comfort security and repose both to the king and country the FOURTHE chap. when occasion be offer that a small or great number of Souldieres be besiege in a town or castle where they be appoint by they re king or general for to defend the same like faithful and true subject where rather they shall die honourable in defence of the same then yield it except great extremity and good reason constrain they thereunto and make notorious there prudence valour and fidelity and if it shall chance to fall out they re comaunder or governoure of such a place trough a covardelie mind or by mean of sell the same for money to the enemy and find that he shall presume to yield the same to the enemy little regard his prince be service nor his own reputation and know that such a place may be defend they all with a brave resolution be to comfort the comaunder present they re reason that such a place may be well defend and at lenghte find his mind yield to the base act and see that reason can persuade not a veil they be with a brave and resolute determinotion to say that to honour they re prince and maintain they re one reputation that like unto faithful subject and honourable souldiere they rather choose to die in defence of the place then yield the same till they know the will of they re general and if the general find no opportunity to they with answer or in soucorringe they they be with a brave and noble determinasion to protest to die in defence of the same with aresolute mind then yield the same covardly estiminge but little the honour of their prince and their one reputasion and find that the governor of that place will not agrie but still go forward in his base mind they may lawful aprehende he and elect another in his place to who they ought to obey and respect as if he be elect by the king or general protest to fulfil with he as a superior and for the better performance thereof to put all their in writhinge so that the enemy be inform of their valerouse determination brave spirit and fidelity they shall hardly fall upon they but upon great and extraordinary advantadge see that they be resolve rather to die in defence of their honour and reputasion then to yield or hazard their fame in rinderinge the same to the hand of their enemy which may use there one discression in a matter of so heavy importance in either gaininge honour or disgrace so considerenge the diferince betwixt thigh two point in the noble profession of arm better and more honourable it be to die in defence of a just and honourable cause and perpetuate the^e fame to all posterity then yield to any low or base imagination when a army do inter into a foreign country and determine to remain their that winter and conquest the same first he be to fortify himself or come in pocession of strong place if it may by possible second to gather all the corn cattle wine bire and all other sort of vituale necessary for the manteinance of his army so that his may not want and that his enemy may by drive unto great extremity and that trough mere extremity they may come to offer themselves to serve as faithful subject so that of matere which bienge prudent and diligent manadge do often time resulte prosperous and good success a necessary thing in war that the of each army do carry their device and token whereby they may by know by their own as friend rather than to fall upon as if it be a enemy not know they as it may well fall out when a general of a army do inter to conquest a kingdom the province or place trough which he march he be to take care to leave they well fortify and sure with good and strong garisone that his and convoy may with the better security pass and repass for cause that importeh much for the better security and good success of his jurney and pretend purpose and if by chance in such place his convoy by beat or break as it may well fall out he may retire to the next adjoninge fort castle or town for his security and so shall all sort of trade merchandise and traffic free pass from place to place conduct with strong and vigilant convoy both foot and horse such person as shall by choose to recnoledge city town fort castle they re fossose and wall and the place easieste to by win as alsoe to recnoledge the place more conveniente to cut trinche these person ought to be choose of man of long experience in war as well in the theoric and practice of the same ingeniouse and of a spirit of a settle mind to hold and take notice of whate he see the peril and danger of the matter the necessary preventione for the same in as much as may be possible in take advantadge of the enemy some that be employ in thigh ocasione do carry arm of proof and targete othere do only carry targete which I think be enough by reason of the great weight of both such man be to arm themselves with a settle mind not fearful but of a brave spirit scilente and patient for otherwise hardly can they bring to perfection they re purpose nor give a good relation of whate be recomend to their charge which by experience be often try in the ocurrante of war when occasion shall offer to give a escalada to a town or fort it be necessary it by at night alittle before day and in a obscure night alittle before day and that to be very silent and secret and with great expedition to execute his purpose but first and before hand ought to be take the height of the wall and place of your execution that the ladere may just conform with the place and that it be nothing high for bienge dangerous for the part within discoveringe he with little pain may turn the ladder and hinder the execution pretend and the ladder ought not to be so short but it may come within two foot to the upper of the wall or just to the same little more or less for otherwise time and occasion may be lose and the first that be to by choose for such exploit be to be pikman and choose of person of brave spirit and valerouse to entertain the place with their pike till the shot do inter and as the pike do inter they be to turn their face toward both side of the wall to keep of the fury of the enemy till the shot do inter and then the leader be to march forward in good order till he come to the best post of the enemy and most fit for his purpose with a troop of choose and resolute muskettieres in the vangarde who dischardginge that value give great terror to the enemy and let they make their rekoninge before hand that their be no turn bake but with a brave resolution step forward with a valerouse determination otherwise athousand to one they be lose for such and semblable be require prudent and brave of try valour and resolution next under god true religion and pure conscience there be nothing to be so high esteem and commend in the profession of arm as obedience acompany with good discipline and example for otherwise all other good part in he be to little purpose and of little estimasion yea and of what sooner quality or condision he be of from a private soldier to a master camp general always the low be to respect the high in degree for the prosperous succese of warlike and it be most necessary that those who do militate in the same do serve with agoode will cencer and faith full show themselves love and loyal in all to their prince and general which they be to sheowe by testimony of good example so they shall be belove and gain good fame and by all likhoode shall have good success and many who bienge assure that their chief do inbrace and recompense all brave in war do venture themselves with a better couradge and resolute determination then if they be constrain by force and of little hope of recompense julius Caesar that famous captain of great renoome who in all his sheow himself with such a generouse mind and love towards his acompany with his military prudence do triumph and over come in 52 battle and encounter of great hazard and dificulte with the slaughter of 110000. person for the space of eight year he govern worthy to be note and keep in perpetual memory when he touke his jurney to pass over the river of the Rhine in germany to fall upon the Suitseres to revenge the injury and treason commit by they against the republic of the roman in kill Casio a famous roman consul and all his people but julius Caesar for a revenge thereof give they a battle they bienge in number 290000. man notwithstanding he defeat 130000. of they and they ask for peace after that Cesar do overcome they he come to a and composition with they a nother thing wourdie to by note that when the suitser do pass the river of the Rhine with 43000. man to inhabit and overcome France Borgondie and flande Julius Caesar heeringe of they re presomtion present depart to meet they and defeat and overcome they and for the most part such as escape the battle for the great renoome and relation they have of his brave and kind entertainment they be content to remain in service under he so that trough his prudence bra conduction and the great contentment have to serve under his command he do overcome all the province of the fleminge and frence and pass into Inglande and do put they under subjection and after pase over sea the Inglish begone to rebel against he so that he be force to return a gain to recover they and leave they settle go into Spain and drive a way and master all that he have under subjection so that this laudable and renoom Captanie leave to all warrior many brave example of perpetual memory his brave and prudent conduction liberality clemency and mangnanimitie make he victorious so that he triumph over Asia Africa and Europa and so many more brave and valerouse warriere for bienge belove by they keep they still content have optained many rare victory and to the contrary o there be who be of bad conduction and careless to content their army have but little good succese as do happen to atilla king of the hunos a proud and cruel man a enemy and scourdge of cristiane be overcome in the battle betwixt he and Theodorico king of the Burgonones in the camp of Cathalanos though he have more man than the Burgonones he be overcome with the of 180000 man in which battle the king Theodorico be slay many more comparisone may be relate but now a day the war be so diferente in usinge no tyranny but rather by industry brave and prudent conduction good discipline daily subtility engeniouse wit inventenge of fire wourke and other military act in war to which help much the read of antiente history of prudent and valerouse captain to sharpen the wit of man and increase the heart and understand of such as do follow the noble profession of arm but let none presume that by only read he can be apt to govern in war in govern of a army nor trust to the same without have exercise himself and practice he in many ocurante of warlike but the learning become none better than the soldier for it bring he to great perfection firimnes and authority many king emperor and captain general do embrace the letteres with arm and find it most necessary and be of rare importance and find that learning be most require to the of this profession more than to any other profession for bienge the true of nobility in the profession of arm the wicked vice of invie be most odious and vileste of all act for bienge master of many vice which resulte of rude and blind ingnorance subject to quareles murmurasion backbitinge disgrace and bad example enemy to all good proceed truth and virtue which do so penetrate the unconsiderate and base understand of many of little conscience and reputation daily decaienge and fall unto many crime and disgrace enemy to frindshipp and accord subject to afronte and vice of bad life and bad end in the profession of arm great care ought to be take of such as be give to such and semblable vice and when by fair mean and good they do not a mind to see they severe punish or drive they a way like base factionere incline to vice trouble and bad example the five chap. whosoever will wish to be a perfect soldier and desirous that of importance be refer to his care and charge first he must by exercise long time in war show he diligent in a plienge himself in the theoric and practic of this art to be couriouse and ingeniouse in many ocurrante and warlike exploit in fortifienge himself in ocasione of necessity either in plain or hilly ground or pasadge or where soever he be to be couriouse in understand the difficulty of the situation the vantadge and disadvantadge of the place and how he may entertain the place in as much as industry can a fourde in consider how can be keep from he and the necessary prevension if he by invioren with wood ditch valley old building in 700. or 800. pace and if their be any such empedimente to see they with speed plain and prevent that he may discover every way and let he look well that he be not deprive of water and in as much possible to inform himself in know all mean the enemy may use to cross he of succour and the sure way or mean who he may receive and use all industry possible in so much that the enemy do not cross he of the pasadge and put themselves in possession of the same he be to fortify himself in as much as may by possible and as the situasion shall permit not grudge at the great pain require to that effect in raise the wall in the height and form requisite the ditch of the bread and height conveniente to raise the bulwark of the same in the height that they may discover the sircuide and place befitinge on each side let he by provide in due time of all necessary and as much as may by and rather have to spare then want alsoe to be provide of several sort of fire wourke which be of rare emportance in many let he by always vigilant and wary and fear of the sudden plot and stratagem of his enemy which may fall upon he when he jest think so let he not whole trust to he and his valour but rather always be ready to receive the alarm with great vigilance and brave resolution so shall he a accomplish the of a prudent careful and vigilant soldier and defend his reputasion when any strong place be besiege and that yove will cut atrince to win the same the person that undertake this charge must by curious and skilful the trince be to by five foot deep and the earth to be cast up on both side than it shall be seven foot deep in some place it be to by ten foot broad in some place eight but in the biginenge it need not to be above eight foot broad and in every place it must by five foot at jest deep these trinche be to by cut and go on cross and crouk so that the enemy do not discover our front but give they still our side and so shall the company inter with the better security and feowe man kilth and they may go up and down the trince at their own ease but they must beware and by in all readiness jest the enemy shall chance of a sudden come to try their valour and kill such as they find in the trince and nail the artillery if they can come so far therefore let their by choose the best and most valerouse pikeman and order they in three in rank to hinder the entinte or empetue of the enemy in thigh and semblable ocasione in war where carelelie officeres and do assist they find themselves amaze for there little care and vigilance in sudden prevent exploit of the enemy after bienge well inform of trusty spy of the little vigilance and care of the enemy it be a easy thing to triumph victory of they so in ocurrante and ocasione of warlike security be to by prevent in due time in as much as industry vigilance and care can afourde and such as do not think upon themselves to prevente the necessary remedy be most common lose and such as do escape remain tatch with great disgrace for bienge overthrow trough careless mind and little discipline so let none by ingnorant but that vigilance and care acompany with military prudence and brave resolution be of rare importance in war the six chap. treat of the office of a captain general of a army this office be of so high dignity and degree the king do choose and elect it be the advice of his prudent counsel of state and war and in this election great consideration ought to by have for bienge the office of high degree in the field which of all reason ought to by commend to the care and charge of a personadge endue with the befitinge part for the execute of so honourable a charge therefore he ought not only to have the perfection and approve part of all other officeres under his command but to excel they all in experience gravity policy secrecy temperance valour constancy vigilance care liberality and to by of brave and resolute determination prevent and execute in due time with care and prudence all thing apertaininge to his charge to relate of all the good part in he it be tedious for he be to by of such perfect judgement of all thing which have and shall by write of this art so that the good part in he require be infinite he be not only to by of perfect judgement in excel all the rest but alsoe to by of a virtuous life in give good example as apateerne light and lantern of all the army so that they may imitate he for most common averteouse and valiant general will choose valiant virtuous and prudent captain and officere and valerouse captain ought to virtuous valiant and skilful souldiere the accident of war be so many that it altherethe the houmore of some of this art except they by endue with singular virtue and constancy which be find but in very feowe very many difficulty do offer in the daily ocurrante of war but great ability be requier to see they prudent order and hardly can any master be have of such perfection but that some time he must err to relate in particular of the part require in a general it be tedious wherefore I will name the four princlpal part the greek and roman desire to occur in such personage first to be skilful in the art of war to be valiant and of brave and prudent resolution to sheowe himself with great gravity and authority and to be fortunate in his sucess if he be acompany with the part and propriety before declare it be enough nevertheless he have enough to learn for the better security and success of his army it be necessary that his person be still well guard in all plase where he march with his army and trough his valeoure and mangnanimitie find that he be incline to present himself the first in all dangere his counsel of war not to permit he for many respect for bienge kilth or take prisoner it be no small matter that beside it be a occasion to animate the enemy and to disanimate we whereof great consideration ought to be take the greek and roman for the defence and repose of their republic have choose their captain general of souldiere of great and long experience in martial whereby they may prudent govern and command with full authority and due respect and therefore they always do choose thigh personadge of man of long practice great experience in war and of reepe year and judgement it be true that Alexander Magnus be but of young year begone to govern and command a army and conquer all Asia and do put the world in amace sometime it be most conveniente that king and prince in person be present with their army for many respect thouge their experience be not great but when such ocasione do present they carry with they the most ancient and experiment captain they find as do Alexander of those captain which king Philip his father have for his counselere and of war and as do king Philipe of Spain when he elect do Juan de Austria for his captain general he a point for his lieutenant do Luis de Suniga the comendador of and to the contrary who infortunate happen to don sebastian king of Portugal not to imitate thigh renoom example of perperpetuall memory in his infortunate and disaster journey make into he be young and unexperimented in war which be cause of he and his army perdition so that young prince in war ought to have for their counselere grave and experiment captain none can denay but this king be of a high conceit and of a most brave and valerouse determinasion but by reason of his young year and less experience in war he want prudence for the due conduction of such a honarble action in the honourable journey make by the famous and renoom conqueror king Edward the third into France send his eyld son the prince of Wales for general name for his counsellor and captain the valiant prudent and renoom earl of oxford Warwick suffolk and salisbury where at the battle of Poitiers they make know their undeniable prudence and great valour that at length they overthrewe the whole power of france and their king John and his son Philipe be take prisonere with very many of the frence nobility to the Inglish be perpetual glory and fame Aniball that renoom captain of perpetual memory be but very young when he begin to govern a army but he have for his counselere ancient and prudent captain and be rule and govern by they till he come to understand give many famous battle and overthrow to the roman till at the end he be overcome with africano that renowned captain of the remain the captain general ought to inform himself well of the force quality and condition of his enemy if or raw man or old and experiment soldier alsoe to be well inform of the situation strength and form of their city town fort and strong hold and of the convenienteste plase to pass over thire alsoe to inform himself of the situation of their camp so that he may be the better prevent when occasion shall offer alsoe to be well inform of person of good judgement and trust of all the difficulty that may hinder he so that in due time he may prevente all necessary prevencione and special see that he trust the relate of thigh and many more ocasione to person of great fidelity and trust and of good understand when the captain general shall inter to conquest aforaigne country he be to indevoure with speed to put himself in pocession of the principaleste pasadge of castle and strong plase and with speed see they well provide with all necessary that thereby he may put the country under subjection and that his amunitione and all other necessary may be transport with the more security from one place to another and with speed to see all place fortify in as much as can possible where any part of his army be constrain trough extreme necessity may safe repair unto for it fale out often time that the ocurrante of warlike affair be subject to many disgrase and may be when we leshe fear wherefore aprudente comaunder ought in due time to prevente such difficulty which be the and security of his army and special to see thigh plase well provide with all sort of amunition and to see that they be recomend to the care and charge of careful and valerouse captain when resolution be take to scale any town fort or strong place first information ought to be take by skilful and trusty person of all difficulty which may be suspect or fear as alsoe of the just height of the wall that laddere may be make for that purpose and not to be overlonge for bienge dangerous for cause that the enemy may easy turn they up side down these laddere be not to be so short but that they may reach to the place of their execution for thigh most common be first employ pikeman of choose and valerouse souldiere to make way till the shot follow to succour they during which time they be to maintain the place with great valeoure till all the shot do join and then with speed go forward well and prudent order and with abrave and resolute tetermination till they come in pocession and master the place and strong watch they find in thigh and other semblable ocasione there be no look after still go forward with great couradge and valeoure which execution ought to be recomend to the care and charge of prudent and valerouse captain and choose which bienge so hit upon great expectasione may be hope of their good success and order ought to be give that in pain of death no soldier shall stir out of his order till the enemy be whole vanquise and all thing due order and prevent goode success be often time obtain by mean of military prudence care and diligence wherefore it be necessary the captain general be very industriouse in know who to invente neowe of war to and entertain the enemy when occasion shall require and to corrupt they with money for many ocurante in war it be necessary to have many trusty spy which serve for many purpose it be most necessary that thigh person by know for man of trust and fidelity for otherwise be of double deal they be most dangerous in all ocasione he shall atempte he be to be very careful and diligent and to know the quality and condision of the enemy comaunder wheader he be and inconsiderate or prudent and repose in his and wheader he be a man of a high mind to come to the fact of arm and to know the quality of his counselere and and of whate determinasione and to be well inform if his army be of bisone or raw man or of anunciente skilful and practise and of whate nasione and of whate desingnes a general can help himself in many have good and trusty spy which be to be very well reward and pay for be their mean often time mattere of great moment be prevent in due time and to the contrarry for want of such trusty and careful person great disgrace do happen and brave interprise lose thigh person be of confidente trust care and ability be agreate repose of mind to the general most necessary it be that some captain and alferise reform of long practice and experience in war shall still asiste next his person to inform of many mattere which do occur unknowen to the general and of great importance to his majesty service and which shall by prevent in due time these person for cause of there long experience and a prove fidelity in materes of war shall rather by employ then othere ordinary send with comisione in visit frontieres magasenes or storehouse and of very many more ocasione of importance to the furtherance of his majesty service and in give true relasion of the extreme necessity of for want of the ordinary and inescusable necessary ordain for they be the prince in their garisone as lodging bede etc. and see that none do procure nor pity they they run away from their colour which may be prevent in due time be mean of faithful and trusty to the better performance of his majesty service and repose of the common wealth and pour inhabitance it be very necesary he shall have trusty person of good skill and understand in war who shall in due time he of many matter which do ocurr unknowen to he or his counsel and very necessary for his majesty service to by prevent in due time against the poisonous design and practice of the enemy it be most necessary to get faithful and trusty spy to know the of the enemy and to whate end they aspire and to see thigh spiee well reward so that with the great care they acomplish the trust empute in they so that matteres of great importance may by discover and prevent without fact of arm only with military prudence his ceasless care and high conceit ought never to be weary in toil after virtue and to attain with travail care and military prudence the glorious issue of his deep design in thigh our late war for the most part all go by favour frindshipp or affection to the great discomodity of his majesty service wherefore the captain general as a supreme justice over a whole army shall have aspeciall care in inform himself well in due time to see amatter of so great importance prudente prevent it alsoe falethe out that when the general cawl for arelasion of the master camp to reform so many captain of each regiment of each nation to reforce other company in such and semblable ocasione the general shall take aspeciall care to by well inform for cause that by daily experience we see thigh sinesterly handle reform those of great service suficiency and valour which be manifest and to no small discomodity to his majesty service in the atempte of many honourable interprise and incountere and to the great decay of military discipline so that for want of many honourable ocasione be daily lose and that result of the little perfection of many officeres in military discipline to see these ocasione and many more due prevent the captain general for many wourdie respect ought to inform himself well in as much that favour frindshipp nor affecsion may take place but rather forward and advance those of long and faithful service prudent carriage renoom act and valour so that in the administrasion of justice he shall by repute for one incline to minister equity and right as alsoe for one of great disgression and wisdom and so most common by all reason the sucess of military discipline shall prosper to the great renoome of the prince repose and furtherance of the common wealth happy be the prince and renoom be the general who in his do imitate the greek and roman in elect the of their army of man expert and skilful in the art of war and most common wise vertuese and valiant general will choose wise valiant and vertuese captain of long practice renoom act and good example so with the assistance of the divine power great hope ought to by expect of their happy success as Alexander the great Scipio africano aniball and many more renoom warriere leave in writhinge suficiente example of the same the end of the second book the third book treat of firewourkes of rare by

treat of patarre to charge a pattar to break a bridge be require six pound of powder or six and half and to break strong port or gate four pound or four and half and for palisado two pound or two and half this pattare be to be charge of the fineste and best powder that can by have which to do well for the perfect execution of the same powder shall be make for it of refine mixture of saltpetre and

effect that the patardy may have time to retire after give fire the require to charge a pattar for this purpose take three part of fine and strong powder five of solpher eight of refine saltpetre or eight and half afterwards mingell all thigh mixture well together till yove corporate they and put to they alittle petrol oil so much that they corporate together and let they dry well in the sun and be well dry fill the pattar with the say mixture for the tienge of thigh pattare aforck with two tooth be esteem the beast and in time of execution to put the same trough the ear of the pattar to fasten the same both with a chain and cord when yove will surprise a place of emportance by scalinge pattar or by mean of any fault in the wall of the same whereby yove may easy come in or by intelligence or treatment of treason ifby pattar yove determine to win the same yove must first by well inform of skilful and trusty spy or of person of trust of the strength and entry of the gate battery bridge palisado buckete and chain of the bridge the height and distance to come to the place of execution and if the ditch by dry or with water and who deep and large and if there be any forlorn centery or corpse that may hinder yove and in whate place they lie and if their by any great ordnance that may play on yove and on whate side it lay and in whate distance^ the place be well discover to effect your intention yove be to use stratagem to divert and ocupie the enemy another way just about the time that yove be ready to execute your desire the time beeingh well hit upon with opportunity and be well inform by trusty spy of no deceit nor fraud fasilitate much the enterprise which be most common alittle before day at which time the centery be most lazy and have more desire to sleep beside that the obscurity help much the interpricce and aprochinge when the pattare be to be plant to their execution betwixt the mouth of the same and the gate or bridge yove be to put aplancke of strong wood of two foot broad and two foot and half long and three foot distance from the place of execution and if yove find that the plank be not strong enough you be to take two bar of iron and put they cross wise for the better performance of your execution and that betwixt the say plank and the place of execution and to order all thigh thing in areadines with every thing apertain before yove come to the place of execution great consideration and curiosity be to be use be the engenious and skilful person that take in hand this business in give fire to the same which be easy and enfalible for such as be of perfect skill in fire wourcke but to othere very dangerous the second chap. how to make a torch to endure against the force of wind and rain take of fine cotton thread which be use for candle the one third part and the other two third part of thread make of fine and make of this accord as thick as your finger then take a quantity of saltpetre and let it by fine stamp and then tack a quantity of and let the cord boil therein a good while till it almost be dry then put into the same a little quantity of ginepe oil and one part of powder two of refine saltpetre and one part of rosin and corporate they all together and let they boil over a soft fire till the cord be almost dry and turn the same often time with much vigilance or it will kindel if any extraordinary hett come near it be dry enough tack it up then take one part of wax one part of rosin half part of one four part of linesatt-oyle and so much of one part of saltpetre three time refine one part of powder and boil all thigh mixture together and when they be well corporate dob your cord in the same mixture as if you be to make a candle and after be dob in thigh mixture often time set the candle a part till it be dry enough then let it be dob in wax as you do other candle till such time as it be of the thickness you will have it to be then lay it up till it be dry and in lightinge the same it will burn with great fury and force and no rain nor wind can quince it and it will yield a great flame and terrible noise that the behouldere will much admire at the same to try who to reduce saltpetre into water take three once of rain water and put it in acaldron over the fire and put into the same two once of saltpetre well stamp and let it boil so long till it come to be water which for many effect of this wourke be good and special to give more force to mixture that be not in they re full substance and perfection to refine solfer and make it more strong put into the same one eight part of quicksilver and @ part of refine saltpetre and melt they over a soft fire till they corporate well and after take the same up and be alittle hot cast it into strong vinegar and within alittle while take it up and it will by of full strength to discover the enemy at night when yove will fall to do any execution cause aquantitie of fagote secret to by put in the most convenienteste place for that purpose that will give yove enough light use they in this manner follow and also will endure long take agoode quantity of ro and four time so much Venetia and half so much of as yove take of roosen and put aquantitie of the say mixture on each faggot and give the same fire with awad of okum dob in powder brandevin and turpintin which wad be dry will present give fire to the fagote and yield agreate flame and endure long and if yove will have it to endure long put aquantitie of upon the faggot in the thickeste part of they and the fire will endure long inoghe the third chap. to arm troncke or cane make for several of this art the figure of which cane you shall see hire follow which be make of light wood and be to be of two foot or two and half long and some short for cause of their weight in time of execution thigh cane be hollow within and make of light tember like the barrel of apiece of ordnance and they must by well bind all round about with strong marlin cord fear jest it shall splinter by mean of the strong and mixture put into the same of which we will now treat after yove have well tie the same alongste with the cord all about yove may doabe or coat the cord in a mixture make of pitch and wax for the more security of the cane in keep it from water and not to splinter which douptles they will exepte they be well handle by man of good experience and practice in this art and let none presume that for the read of many good book he can bring this wourcke to perfection for it be of such rare and deep judgement in the order and measure in proportion of the seaveral sort of mixture require for the same in the drienge and manadgeinge of they be require great consideration good skill vigilance and rare judgement of long exercise whereof I have see many dangerous trial both in the handle and of this wourcke in his due measure and proportion therefore consideration care and vigilance be require the require for the say cane take six part of musket powder four of solfer a haulf part of quicksilver one part of crystal glashe beat into powder one part of armoniac alsoe beat into powder one part of camphire three part of saltpetre three time refine two part of rosin all which cause to by well stamp and mingle together then tack of gineper-oyle or petroll oil as much as will wet a little all the say mixture then put as much strong brandevin as shall be sufficient to wet well all the say mixture and mingel they together and let they be dry in the sun or over a soft till they corporate well then put a monghste they a little quantity of fine cotton make or a anoint in fine beat powder and gineper oil and when all thief be dry fill your cane or trunk put in the bottom of the same three musket-shotes of powder or more acording to the greatness of the cane than a quantity of your mixture then a little powder than mixture than alittle powder and so till you almost fill the cane to the brim leave two enche empty where you shall put dry mixture quick and apt to kindel fire and half a quarter of a once of fine powder in the very mouth of the cane and stick into the same a piece of match make of fine cotton and boil in aqua gineper oil and fine powder of the best you can find to present kindle fire when occasion shall require and when you will bigin with the execution of the same you be to give fire in the mouth of the cane and it will yield a most furious and great flame till it burn out and the execution of the flame will reach some 12. foot and with a great fury and force which artificial cane be excellent to force into ship or into a breach or trinche alsoe it be most excellent to break any order or array and special in narrow or straight place as the draught mark with the letter A. sheow a. the four chap. another way to arm artificial cane of fire-wourcke take three part of rosin two part of brimstone one half part of the grease or fat of a hog @ part of red wax cause the rosin and brimstone to be beat into powder and mingell they together then put to they the grease and red wax and put they over asofte fire in a caldron or earthen pot stir they still till they corporate well and remain a good while over the fire then take five part of serpintin powder of the best and of saltpetre three time refine three part which must be beat to powder then take two part of camphire stamp than one part of crystal glash which must be beat into fine powder alsoe one part of armoniak which must be beat in into powder all which yove shall put into the say mixture and let they all boil over asofte fire till they be well corporate and dry or if yove will tack they up when they be well corporate and reasonable dry it emport nothing by reason they be quick to kindle fire and require not over much drienge and if yove find that the mixture be not well wet that they may the better corporate put alittle a or petroll oil or of both to they till yove see that they be very well corporate he that undertake to any store of thigh fire-wourckes must make up a furniesh for the cannoneer security of the same for put the mixture in caldrone or pot over the fire as many do it be dangerous except it be handle be one of perfect skill and great vigilance which jhave often time try for the fill of your artificial cane or trunk with the aforesaid mixture need much consideration and practice for the perfect execution of this wourcke put in case it be acane where aboy be arm can inter into yove must fill it as follow but if great or lesh consideration must be take in fill the same with the mixture in measure and proportion or it will fail in burn all of asodaine or very slow so that great practice and curiosity be require for the perfect handle of this wourke for the fill of the say cane before speak of put into the bottom of the same two hand and half full of musket powder than three hand full of the drieste mixture than two hand full of powder than four hand full of the mixture than a little powder than five hand full of the mixture and so still in this course till you fill your cane within three eache of the mouth of the same which you shall fill with very dry and quick mixture apt to kindle fire and on the upmoste part or mouth of the cane some powder that don take a piece of match make of fine cotton and sod in gineper-oyle and fine beat powder and well dry in the sun or over asofte fire till ib be very well dry of this match cut three enche and it into the mixture that be in the mouth of the cane and when you be ready for your execution do but give fire with your ordinary match to this gunpowder match and present at the first touch of your ordinary match or of any other fire it will instant kindel fire advertise that you be to cover the mouth of the cane with a piece of strong parchment and bind it well so that the mixture may not fall out of the cane the end of the match must a peer trough the say parchment to give it fire when occasion shall require and then the cane shall present bigin to wourcke with great fury and terrible to the behouldere for the wonderful flame and terribel noise I have see trial make often time that theyer be nothing that put one in more terror than thigh instrument be well make and due handle and douptles the flame and noise of this fire will put the enemy in great terror when it bigine his course of execution and none so valiant dare stay near it as long as the flame endure and questionless it will make a way as far as the half pike and flame can reach though ever so valiant your enemy be and it be a most excellent instrument to board ship force or to give fire to they re mine if you perceive where the same do lay advertise that the say cane shall shoot of two shotte one after a nother the first that lay in the third degree and the other that lay in the bottom these cane can be make several manner of way be such as be curious in the manadginge of this art none can bring to perfection but with long practice and much charge be reason the and mixture require for the same be wonderful dear so that for the say respect hardly can you find one in ten thousand that will undertake the execute of this wourcke may be some will that be curious in read many brave think that only by the same they know enough they be far deceive for I know that without practice they shall fall into very many whereof I have see very many trial make and beside great charge before they can come to the perfect judgement of the deep secret and curiousity of this rare art these cane or troncke of fire-wourcke be handle several manner of way be such as be curious for some be of quick othere of slow acording as the occasion shall require in put to they mixture agriable for that purpose some yield a flame of 16. foot but thigh endure but very short othere yield a flame of 12. or 13. foot which endure long which be make for sudden othere be make which do yield a flame of 9 or 10. foot which do endure long I nogh for any sudden exploit for thigh be make for such such as do not endure a above the @ part of a quarter of a hour will almost whole burn the cane I mean all the inner part of the same such as be make to endure half a quarter of a hour will whole burn the cane into a eishsee as fast as the mixture or do burn so any body may perceive that thigh be of wonderful force and of rare which questionless shall so by find by such as will take the pain and charge to make trial and be expert in the due handle and manadginge of they these mixture be to be put in cane make like the figure follow mareke with the letter b. b. the five chap. artificial bullet and cross bar make of fire-wourke to shoot out of great ordnance to burn ship or house or to be shoot into magasen or munition house of the enemy out of great ordnance or to be shoot into the enemy camp to burn they re quartere which be to be make and order in this manner follow take four part of saltpetre three time refine of brimstone two part of camphire one part and half of rosin two part of armoniak one part of crystal glash beatin into powder half apart of bay sault one four part all thigh be beat into powder mingle they together this be do take one half part of the fat of ahog of turpintin one four part of oil so much more of one than put thigh mixture together over a soft fire in acaldron or strong earten pot and mingel they altogether till they corporate very well then when they be a good while over the fire put to they six part of serpintin-pouder and corporate they well and when you find that they be reasonable dry take they up and make a plaster or cover of so thick as the back of a knife and so broad as shall cover the bullet or cross bar all that be order as before declare take 4. part of serpintin-pouder of the best and cause it to be beat into powder take of refine saltpetre two part of rosin two part armoniac one part brimstone one part all which must be beat into powder then wet thigh mixture with two part of strong brandevin or one part of gineper-oyle one part of turpintin half part of linsat-oyle that do put over the fire the rosin brinstone the geneper-oyle the turpintin and linsat-oyle a above mention and when they be melt and well corporate put into the same the saltpiter armoniac and four part of serpintin-pouder and corporate all thigh mixture together and a noint the twoa in they till you find it full of the subce of the same then let the be all over cover with the first mixture make for the bullet a about a finger thickness or more alwae tackinge regard that it do agree with the piece out of which you intend to shut the same and when the coat of the say bullet be cover and full of the say mixture then wrap it round a bout the bullet or cross bar and it very well with strong marlin cord and benge well bind with the say cord and shoot out of a piece of ordnance it will burn with terrible force and great fury and water can not quince it of the which for curiosity as alsoe to know of the operation thereof I make several trial these mixture need not much drienge when they be well corporate over a soft fire but the outward plaster of twoa of the three wherewith you be to cover every bullet and in such sort that present it may kindle and give fire to the inner to the which when you give it fire it will burn with great force these bullet be excellent to burn ship and to by cast into town to burn house they re execution be of such wonderful force that questionless they will burn a oaken board and if you cast water upon they the more they will burn and will make such a wonderful noise able to put the behouldere in great terror and special such as have no understand of they re operation for when the water be cast upon they they shall give a great cry just as if it be of a wild boar whereof I make several trial wourdie the look upon and none of the behouldere of the same dare stay near in a great distance for the strange operation of the same and the terror whereunto they put the behouldere but such as know of the course of they re operation which be almost incredible but to such as be a quaint with the same for the better execution of the cross bar and special be sea they shall be make with iron chain fasten to the end that first must by put into the piece which be most excellent to cut sail of ship rope mast and to make other great spoil the figure of which yove see here follow where the let c. sheow these cross bar be to be coate as before teach and with the self same mixture the bullet be alsoe to be coate take regard that the bullet be make no great but that it may inter into the piece of ordnance out of which yove mean to shoot the same and they be to be double bind all round about very well with strong marlin cord fear that be the great force of their roar and wrastle out of the piece the and be not well bind shall be untie and tack no effect which questionless it will except it by very well bind as before declare of the which I cause myself trial to be make the figure of thigh bullet and cross bar you see hire mark with the letter c. c. the six chap. to arm a half pike with fire-wourcke to inter or board ship force or to inter into a trence or baterie or break any order or array where the ball fasten to they shall fall thigh ball be to be make of light wood of the bigness or somwhate great than abuter box and of the very self same make but that it must be bore with four hole crosswise and of the greatness that your thom may inter into they which shall by fill in this manner follow take of the same mixture and that be ordain for the artificial cane to which you be to add two part of rosin and one part of brimstone of the best and melt thigh together put alittle to they of the strong yove can find and bienge well corporate and melt put the other mixture over the fire and when they be hot put the moult rosin and brimstone to they and corporate all together and be almost can fill your artificial ball therewith as full as they can hold put a little of the drieste mixture and powder in the mouth of each hole of the four and alitel cotton boil in gun powder brandevin and gineper-oyle and afterwards dry very well that thereby they may present kindel fire that don take as much or tow as will cover or coat they make aplaster of the same of ahaulfe ence thick or little lesh this coat or plaster cause to by sod over asofte fire in fine beat powder to the quantity of four part of saltepiter two part rosin two part armoniacke half a part brimstone one part and all thigh be first beat into powder let they be wet in brandevin and giniper-oyle and well corporate together then take as much ocam as will cover they as before declare and when all thigh mixture be well corporate and dry over asofte fire then spread they upon the with which yove intend to coat your ball and put on the same to the thickness of half anence or little lesh of the say mixture and wrapp the same round about the ball and let it be tie very well with cord and when all this be do take a piece of gunpode match be well handle and dry and bind it in several part of the ball that in touch the same with your ordinary match it will present kindle fire and without delay and it will bigin to burn with a most wonderful flame and terrible noise that it will put the behouldere in great terror and if it fall upon aboard or any other thing apt to kindle fire it will burn it into aeish and alsoe the cover that go about the same the terror whereunto thigh ball do put the behouldere of they when they burn be uncredible but to such as do see the same whereof jmade several proof and find it so that no body dare stay near thigh half pike sometime be arm with skubbe make of fire wourcke which alsoe be good to offend or defend thigh ball and half pike be of rare which draught yove see hire under mark with the letter d. d. a prudent and brave conductor of aforecaste considerasion bienge determine with military prudence and resolution of he and of his valour to fall on any execution most common they be wont to have good sucess to which effect many stratagem and military prudence be require and bienge in the field and resolve to give battle or at jest to dommadge or put the enemy in great terror very necessary it be to by provide with bullet across bar and iron chain arm with wild fire to by shut out of great ordnance the which in such as also in sea servicee be of rare execusione bienge prudent arm and manadge by one of perfect judgement and long practice in this art these bullet or cross bar bienge shoot out of great ordnance in the front of abattell or of a army in areasonable near distance be of wonderful and special iron chain and cross bar they be alsoe good to cut the tackle of ship shroud mast yard top mast sail etc. the draugh of which bullet yove see hire follow where the draught with the letter A. sheow and how to chain they together when yove put they into a piece of ordnance and the draught with the letter b. sheow how the same fly trough the air when it be discharge out of a piece of ordnance and who it spread a sunder in some they be arm with artificial fire-wourckes to burn town ship the quarteres of the enemy as also their store house or magasenes which cross bar be envent for that purpose and bienge prudent handle and arm by one of perfection in fire wourcke I be assure that if they fall into any thing apt to kindle fire without delay they shall burn and kindle fire for often time I make trial of their operasion and uncredible force and terror and often time to try their nature and course of their execution I cause to cast water upon they notwithstanding they burn with the more vehemence and terror and when the water be cast upon they they give such aterrible noise wourdie the admiringe and burn with such force these half pike be arm another manner of way with fire-wourcke that be to say take apece of the strong canvas yove can find as big or of the greatness yove think fit for your purpose and fashionige the same as yove shall see here follow be the figure mark with the letter e. this piece of canvas yoveshall cause to be dob in melt and when it suke I noghe of the liquor take it up and put aforme into the same or fill it with dry sand and when it be dry cast the sand out and fill it of the receit make for the artificial cane but that they must be mingle with two part more of rosin and ahaulfe part of brimstone which must by smelt over asofte fire and corporate the same and the other together and fill the say canvas with they be well fasten with marlin cord and the half pike trouge the midel of the same as the draught follow sheow and in the mouth of this scuibb yove be to put a quantity of very dry mixture and some powder that without delay it may kindle fire the execution of this instrument be execellent to board ship to burn sail to inter atrince or anay narrow place or to break any order or array if yove please yove may fasten or into the say scuibb in degree light pipe or cane of iron or brace of five enche long be of apistol or caliver boar place the touch hole thereof towards the out ward side of the mixture be well bind to the pike so that it do not fall at jest till the execution be finish and let the touch hole be prime with good powder also yove may put abullet into each one of thigh pipe be charge with good powder and well handle they will do great execution e. to arm half pike with fire-wourcke which be rare to burn sail of ship or to board or force into ship or assault trinche or any narrow place they be both good in many defensive and offensive be sea and land they be to be fill with the self same receit before teach and alsoe coate in the self same manner for at night to inter into a trince or forte force they be of most rare and douptless they shall put the enemy into great terror by reason of the fury terrible noise and force of their flame in the of patarre and camisada they be wonderful good be recomend to the charge of brave souldiere of approve valeor and resolute for douptless they will put the enemy into great terron for sudden in trinche or breach at night they be wonderful good the figure of their draught you may see hire under set down as mark with the letter f. f. for to offend or defend in diverse of importance you may arm a halbarde with a device of fire-wourcke in the self same manner as before teach to arm pike and with the self same mixture and coate with the like coatinge as before teach for the arm of pike to which you may bind with copper wire three or four short pipe like caliver barreles of six or seven enche long make of brace and load with powder and bullet as the draught by the letter g. sheow which alsoe be plase betwixt pike be good for several ocasione of service you may alsoe arm targete in the self same manner which for very many in war be good and let none be ingnorante that thigh engine of fire-wourcke be well and curious handle do put the enemy in wonderful terror and special in sudden and stratagem use often time at night g. the SEAVENTHE chap. the figure follow be arm and well order be ofrare execution in narrow or straight place either to ofende or defend and be very necessary in many be sea and land on the two shoulder whereof you may arm two scubbe fill with the receipt before teach and in the inner part of the instrument which be make of iron for this purpose which you see by the figure follow and go cross the pike you may put five pipe of iron or brace prepare and make for that purpose and that each of they be of eight or nine enche long and so great in the boar as a pistol barrel which be to be fasten with nail and copper wire and to charge they with good powder bullet and wad that do you may cause they to give fire one after on other in lay all a longhste the touch hole a piece of fine linenge clath fill with fine powder and wet in gineper-oyle that the fire may take her course by degree so that the say pipe shall shout one after a nother as you will desire it to do either quick or slow that the line wherein you put the powder to give fire to the touch hole be to be well fasten or bind yuste upon the touch hole with marlin cord so that the course of they re execution may tack effect in just the due time ordain the which in give fire to the first the rest will discharge one after a other during which time the two scubbe place on the two shoulder of the instrument be fire will burn during the time of the execution of thigh pipe and rather more and will yield a great flame the that go to this instrument be the self same before teach for to arm scubbe so that this instrument be handle by one that be skilful and curious in this art the execution whereof be wourdie the behouldinge and shall see who orderly shall those five shotte discharge one after a other either quick or flow as the curious understander of this wourcke will have the same to be so acordinge shall he put the proportion require for the execution he desire the draught of this instrument sheow the letter h. hire after in ocasione of triumph you may cause other pipe or cane great than thigh to by make of the greatness of the boar of a arcabuse crock and of fiftine inch long in the barrel which be fill in this manner follow be worthy to by admire fill each of the say cane as follow first take a caliver shoot of powder and charge the first cane therewith then beat upon the same a stop or wad of fine cotton boil in powder brandevin and petrol-oyle then fill upon the same to the quantity of a good musket shoot of the mixture make for the artificial cane and upon the same a stoppel of cotton as before teach then amusket shoot of powder then fill the rest of the cane or barrel to the mouth of the mixture make for the artificial cane and take heed that you do not beat they hard upon the powder and see that thigh mixture be very dry for be so require for this execution and observe the self same order for the fill of the rest of the cane and all along the mouth of thigh put apiece of line full of fine stamp powder wet in gineper-oyle and brandevin and see that it be very well fasten just upon the mouth of thigh cane that no fire can touch the same but that which be ordain as before teach so in give fire to the first cane or barrel the rest in order one after another will discharge and each of thigh bareles or cane shall yield two shoot and aflame which shall endure but very short the mixture require for this execution be of that which be make for the artificial cane the draught of this instrument sheow the letter h. advertise that thigh mixture be to by very dry and apt to kindle fire and in they re putinge to the barrel to beat they very soft for be so require h. the eight chap. to arm a row with artificial fire-wourckes ahies artificial arrow be shoot out of great ordnance be good to burn house or in they be alsoe good to burn the enemy quarter the manner who to arm they be to tack apiece of strong canvas boil alittle in and to fill the same with the before thaughte to arm half pike and that it be well bind to the arrow with marlin cord for the due proportion length and weight of thigh arrow be require the assistance of acuriouse matematisian or of one of good judgement in give the necessary for the make of they several manner of way some to pearche ship from side to side either above or under water othere to be shoot afar of to burn house or quartere great curiosity and perfect judgement be require for the several manner of way which thigh arrow be to be handle and make acording to there several some be make to burn the ammunition of powder in ship if they chance hit the same and which will pearche any ship from side to side and be of far great execution than your bullet the draughe whereof the letter i. sheow i. the nine chap. to arm artificial instrument ordain in make of mettle fill with composisione and mixture of fire-wourcke to burn of asodaine ship gate bridge palisado or any other combustible thing apt to kindel fire take four part of rosin one part of armoniak four part of salpiter three time refine a half part of bay sault all which cause to by beat into powder then take one part of linsatt-oyle of the fat of a hoge one part then cause all thigh composisione to be mingle together and put they in apott make for that purpuse over asofte fire and let they boil till they corporate well and then take they up and put into they one part of camfire and three part of musket powder and mingell they well together and put they over asofte fire till they corporate well then take they up and put to they small of gun-pound match make of fine cotton and boil in fine beat powder strong brandevin and juniper oil or petroll-oyle then take four part of and cause it to be beat into powder and let it be mingle with the rest mixture then cause the instrument or pot make for this purpose to be fill till you come to the third part of the pot or instrument that do take of the other mixture without and fill the rest of the instrument with they and on the upermoste part of all put of the drieste mixture and let they be so dry that they by apt to kindle fire and in the very mouth of the instrument cause to be put a quarter of a ounce of powder and of the best and to the same apiece of gunpowder match some four inch deep into the instrument and cause it to be well cover with apiece of canvas till time of execution so that water nor fire can touch the mixture nor the powder and when occasion shall ofrer to give it fire do but touch the gunpowder match with your ordinary match and it will present kindle fire yea and much soon than powder to which effect this gunpowder match be make of purpose these instrument in time of execution they have they re strong chain of iron that they may by bound and fasten to the place of they re execution so that they do not fall nor that the enemy may use any endustrie to cut or put they of so that the execution may take effect it be very good for the security of their execution to arm two or three artificial cane on both side of they which be ro be rocomend to person of brave spirit and of approve valeor and determination these when they bigin with they re execution they re operation and execution be most rare advertise that they must be put in to iron or brass pot make for that purpose as the figure follow sheow and also with they re strong iron chain for in put thigh into veseles of wood questionless the force of this fire will burn they at a instant which for curiosity and alsoe to know the operation of this fire y cause trial to by make and find that thigh instrument make of wood do present burn and consume into aiesh and be soon consume then the matter that be put into the same be reason of the wonderful force of the fire of the say which rare and wonderful brief execution be worthy the admiringe the order and figure of the say instrument you see hire under where the k. l. m. sheow k. l. m. the receipt wherewith fire-wourck instrument be arm in find they re operation slow you be to augment they with dry mixture apt to kindel fire as powder saltpetre brimstone armoniac and migell they well together and let they be corporate with the sloe mixture in their due proportion also the mixture you find quick and apt to burn and do not endure acording as they re execution require you be to augment they with a little slow mixture as linsat-oyle turpentine rosin and wax but great consideration and curiosity be require in put they in their due proportion a artificial bawl of fire wourcke be discharge out of a piece of ordnance in a clear day can not by discern nor see till it decline to the earth but be shoot out of a piece of ordnance at any mark in a dark night may by perceive and special when it begin to decline out of his right course or line and the more dark the night be when it be discharge out of a piece of ordnance the better you may discern it but in the begin of the range or line you can not see it so perfect as when it begin to decline to the earth which I have try at the leaguer of Breda the night a point for the triumph do for the regaininge of that place if for curiosity you will have a ball make with wild fire to burn within the water let the coat thereof first burn a little before you cast it into the water so that it give fire to the there in ordain for his execution which be fire to wit that part or part where in the vent be be fill with air do cause the other part of the same to shume and burn a above the water with a wonderful noise admirable to the behouldere the ball make for this purpose be light and if you put they into a piece of ordnance be load with the ordinary powder require for the execution of the same in their roar and wrastle of this ball it will burst unto piece so that for to shout bullet or ball out of great ordnance arm with fire wourcke the cross bar now of late invent be the best the manner of arm and coatinge thigh bullet and cross bar I have set down before who and with whate which be of rare by sea and land be well order by one of perfect judgement in this art I have alsoe put down neowe invent across bar to be shoot out of great ordnance which be arm as before teach be excellent to burn town and the enemy quarteres and well assure that no comprabell device for that purpose be as yet invent neither to by shoot in the front of a battle I mean those cross bar invent with chain for be discharge out of a piece of ordnance in a reasonable near distance in the front of a battle or any order or array I doupte not that it be the best invention that have be divise as yet for that purpose the enemy be a reasonable distance of but the enemy be very near at hand the cartadge and bag fill with musket bullet nail piece of iron piece of chain which be shoot out of great ordnance be of wonderful be handle by prudent and curious gunnere of perfect judgement and long practice in this art the draught mark with the letter n. sheow how the say cross bar shall be put into the piece and the letter o. sheow how the same fly violent trough the air and how it spread a sunder when it be shoot out of the piece give a terrible noise in his motion and range n. o. the draught mark with the letter p. sheow how this other cross bar be to be put into the piece and when it be discharge the letter q. sheow how it spread a sunder and fly with great violence in his line and range p. q. the TENTHE chap. treat of the confine of a kingdom as alsoe of the good law to by observe in the same and of many necessary thereunto apertaininge and who the same be to by fortify and strong by art or by nature or by both such as be desirous to be and expert in warlike it import that they be of good judgement in fortificasione as well to offend as to defend notwithstanding that for this purpose in all kingdom and state be elect inginere a luinge they a good pinsion yet such as be of long practice in war and do apply themselves well in hope to by advance by their a prove good part and suficiencie ought to exercise themselves in bienge very necessary in own who profesed to be expert in this art of war and know how to intrinch and fortify himself in many ocurrante in open field how to cut a trince to win a town or any strong place as also to know how to draw the plot of town fort and castle and also in know all necessary for the defence thereof and to know how to prevente the stratagem to be fear of his enemy douptless thigh thing be of great consideration for the strength of akingdome consist much in be well fortify together with the quantity and quality of his subject and in the good quality of his dominion and country those prince and reepublikes be judge mighty and strong which in their kingdom and state do mountain good religion good law and good arm and do exercise the same and do enjoy wholesome air fertile ground and natural strength with such other conveniente comodity thereunto require to by understand that all country be strong by nature or by art or by both by nature they be strong when they be invior with the sea round about or on part thereof or back with marrass or and those to be strong by art and in their frontieres next adjoin and place most conveniente to have town castle and fortress fortify by art all confine be either maritime or mediterraneall or both the one and the other whether they be montanouse place or in plain or do participate of the one and the other if they by mediterraneall it must by view and consider on whate part the enemy may come to offend the same and where he may most comodiouse come to atempte and it be alsoe to be consider on whate part he may make his inroad and retire a gain with safety and whether their by any situation which be fortify by the enemy may molest or a noy the country next adjoin if the confine of the kingdom by maritime or on the sea coast all the coast and circuide of the same be to by view and remarck that prevention may be take in due time in as much as may possible to hinder the enemy imbarcasion in the place most fit for the same yea and in all place which may by suspect if it be possible for the better security of the kingdom or state but in some kingdom the circuide and place on the sea coast be so great that hardly all can be fortify and so the enemy arivinge with a mighty army and may be in a place little suspect may put the kingdom and country in great peril and danger as be see by the spanish navy at the conquest of portugal when they land near cascale in a place never think upon by the portugese so that they find themselves deceive think that the disembarcation shall have be betwixt the citti of Lisboa and sangilians castle where they stoude fortify in their trinche with determination to hinder the disembarcation of the spanish navy but he land in aplace far better for his purpose and of much lesh danger which be on the other side of cascale towards the north little teach of by the portuge so that it be teach that sea coast be with great cost and difficulty defend thouge their be many place strong by nature or by art and for asmuch as their and variable quality of confine and hardly any rule to be give for their proporsione nor whate distance from frontier to frontier it must be presume that the confine of akingdom do hold some corespondance with the circuide of a citti in fortifienge whereof the bulwark be of the most membere the which most common be put in the place where they can most offend the enemy and defend themselves and the place regard due distance in such sort that the one may defend the other in as much as may by with their artillery and small shot and in like manner the curtine and n. i. flank betwixt bulwarck and bulwarck with other thereunto apertaininge and even so the fort to be make in the frontieres be to hold the like proportion and correspondance with the confine of the country as do the bulwark with the curtine of acitti or strong place the one to be place so near and in due distance unto the other that they may asiste and socour one another and in such part that they may damnify the enemy and defend themselves in as much as can be possible num. i. the place bienge view and find apt to receive offence by the enemy and also to offend he it be necessary to fortify the same as well upon the sea coast as the inland with strong take good advice and careful consideration in choisinge the situation thereof whether it by on plain or hill or marittim or consist of all the three understand that the circuide of the place or fortification be to have aconveniente space round about neither to much nor to little for many respect the situasione in plain be strong which be invioron with deep lake great moor great and such as may by sink under water in time of necessity as in Holande and Zelande and such as have or plain sufficient distant from all thing that may over command the same the situation that be upon a hill that be strong that stand on the most high part thereof and all underlay with natural rock round about not have near it any superior nor equal moante as be the castle of lisburne for all which have a dificulte access be strong when they can not be offend from other adjoininge moante and the much more strong when it be not minable all strong place most common be win either be force of arm battery treason surprice or by long beseedginge or by assault scalinge or underminige the maritime be strong when they be compass by the sea or part thereof and the rest divide from the main by great and deep ditch as be the castle of sand jean in Portugal who have on the shore side a deep ditch dig upon a rock and the main sea on the other side or buitlte upon the top of some rock with the say comodity as be the penon of veles or the castle of cascale in Portugal city and town be make strong by nature and industry of those by nature we have all ready speak in the strength of city by industry be strong by the form and by the matter strong by the matter when they have thick wall great broad and deep ditch by the form they be strong when it be frame in such sort that the most fardeste and all quartere may have corespondance to offend the enemy with the cannon and fiery shot of this sort be those which do most near a proach unto the sircular figure but with good regard of the due lardgne and proportion of the curtine and equal distance from bulwark to bulwark their inter amongst thigh all town and strong fort consist of five six seven eight nine or ten ravelinge and curtine by directe line and who many more angel so much the better the four angule of all be the weakeste it be to be understand that small place of themselves be weak because they can not so sufucient resist any excessive battery and other offence as great place may which have room capable enough to raise defence and necessary rampire and horn wourke a gainste any great force neither ought they to be so large that the circuide thereof will require awhole army to defend it num. 2 the of city and castle be principal ground a gainste the offence of great ordnance and alsoe defend with the same and with other fiery weapon it be to be consider that the artillery be divide and differense into greatness or Zices royal and into lesh zice of the zice royal be that piece that shoot of seavintine pound upwarde as be the culverrin the quarter cannon the demi cannon the cannon and double cannon the pedrero basalisco and such like and for the lesser zice the diference be to be understand that all that shoot bullet from seavintine pound weight downwards as be the demiculverin the saker the minnon the falcon and falconett even to the rabinet and arcabuse de crock the bulwark be upon the angle or of the form of the city or fort and of such distance and due proportion as shall seem to the skilful engineer and they ought to by make optouse or blunt and not sharp for so they be more strong and capable the part of the bulwark be the travess or flank orechion pum guard or shoulder the front or curtain the conter-fronte or spur the pestille or parapetto the place or room for the artillery the bulwark as I say be place within the angle where place be to be make ready for the artillery and to mount the same in such a height that it may discover the camp or circuid on every where in at much as be possible it be to by consider that the curtine of the bulwark shall stand in such sort that they may be touch or beat from the first corner from who flank or trave it take his defence and the line or point be to be take some whate more from the flanker and in such distance agreeable to the greatness of the bulwark so acording to the greatness of the same the measure be to by increase or deminise observe the due proportion require it be necessary to make in the bulwark certain issue the which be make in the part that look towards the flanker or travess thigh be most necessary to put man out for the ditch the conterforte and apertenance of the bulwarck have alsoe their measure and the which I leave to avoid prolixity and because that they may by more or lesh acording the discretion and plate of the curious and perfect engineer the Cavallero within side adjoin to the curtain in the mideste of they be build and from such cavallero be the curtine or wall of the bulwark defend and alsoe the field and for this cause be the bulwark wont to by make and to raise they so high that they may discover well the place of they re num. 3 the gate or port of a town city or fort be to by place in part most comodiouse for the service of the same both in peace and war conveniente to receive in or to put out people most safe and sure from all offence in as much as can by the gate must have his draw bridge make of strong timber and yrone necessary for the same it be to be reasonable broad for the commodity of the wagones and artillery and very strong if they re by no more than one draw bridge or gate let they not be directe necessary it where that no high wales nor hedge of garden nor ocharde nor such like by permit on the outward part of the gate or wall of any city or place of importance and a distance of 600. pase but all raze and make plain on all the circuide round about which do often time serve for ashelter to the enemy to approach of asuddaine near the wall that they can not by discern till they come into the ditch by reason that tree and hedge do shelter they by which mean many place of importance be soon lose the be the only remedy against the fury and execution of the artillery and be to by make with in and behind the wall close to the same and the cavaller and bulwark ought to by make in such fort that the wall bienge fall the same may remain and stand like almighty mount against the enemy and shall by make of such fast and massy earth that it cromble slip nor roll not and so fall down as do many make of runinge sand the height and bread thereof ought to by such as the commodity and seat will require all thigh thing be the membere of a fortification the which how much more fit and proporsional they by place about the body of acitti or place of importance so much do it make the same more strong and beautiful num. 4 thigh due have and resolution take than Aploott must be draw with conveniente rule and measure to reduce the citti or place to the best form that may by with as little ruin or defeatinge of house or church as can be plasinge the bulwark and cavallere and other edifice conveniente to their seat and purpose in the place most fit for the same and that to be do with as little loss to the inhabitant as may be possible resolution take upon the design form and greatness that the place or fortress be to have he be to fortify the feobleste part or part thereof first and the apteste to by offend the fortification well fortify and finish it be necessary that it be furnish with a conveniente garrison of for the better security and defence thereof for otherwise it be like a body without a soul and beside this if it have not provision of all sort of vitualle artillery and and of all arm defencive and offensive in good and sufficient store and of shovel spade mattoke pickax saw hamere iron sledge bar of iron nail rope etc. and many other instrument to work in earth or in wall or in stone or in tember and alsoe in water mande baskete hand barrow and wheel barrow plank beam stake watlinge gabione and other thing at battery and beseedginge without the which it be impossible to repair and intrinche against battery asaulte and other ofence of the enemy all which belong to the office care and duty of the general of the artillery to see they provide in every town or place of any importance within the realm as also all other place which stand for the defence and safety of the same these we treat of be very coste and hardly to by perform but by a mighty prince and special such as be make with brike stone good earth and thurff as be the castle and citti of and sand Gilian in Portugal and the castle of Milan and sundry othere the lick be hardly bring to perfection but with expense of millone so now adays all place be fortify with earth and thurff only as be for the most part the great town of Gante mastrick dam ostend hulste and many more place in the low country as Sluse weasel and the town of Breda which have endure such gallant battery sufficient to wear out a great and mighty prince both in his power and purse which be to be see in the famous siege and regaininge of Breda where all king and prince in Cristendom for the most part on both side sheow their force and might not withstand it be win by the invencible power of that mighty monarch the Catholic king of Spain trough his great might and power acompany with the prudent brave conduction and military industry of his renoomed general Marques Spinola and many brave captain and together with the incomporable power love and unity of his faithful and renoom lubjecte of the unite province of the low country to their great glory and honour and so spread abroad and relate by many to their and great fame and renoome of perpetual memory to all posterity whereof to relate it be tedious and incredible to such as have not see the same with so many thousand of wagones full of all sort of vitualle and amunisione come every day where may by perceive the love and great encomparable might of his unite subjete of the unite province all which I have see and this town of Breda invioren with adoble trince round about some five league with very many fort and redute all which be finish in very feowe day with earth and fagote in fine such may serve to good purpose and endure sufficient be well and ingenious make and of good earth and careful remend in due time and when any piece of the same shall fall or decay present to be repair and make up num. v. all strong place of importance be to be well fortify within as also on the outward part and great consideration ought to by take that the enemy may not a proach to the wall or gate without be discover before they may come to execute their intent for which in all strong hold and place of importance most common be place on the outward part round and centery and place for their defence and retreat with such consideration and prevention that the enemy do not a rive unknown to the desire place of their execution as relate by their spy without first be spy out in due time be the outward cintery and round so that all the rest may have time to by all in arm and each company to repair in time with speed with the first advice or alarm to their culoure and there in all readdines to repair where they shall be command by the comaunder or governor of the place advertise that for many no company ought to repair or budge without order of the governor or sardgente-mayor for fear of inconvenience and secret corespondance to see thigh and many more ocurrante in war prevent it be most necessary that the governor and sardgente mayor do lodge as near possible to the place of arm or meaine guard so that urgent ocasione may by prevent in due time and with all speed as occasion shall require the cintery perdue and outward round ought to be choose of vigilant and brave advertise that the round ought still to go forward and very scilente and to make no nor stay as some careless round do and that for the great trust and care refer to their charge to see thigh well order and fulfil the governor and sardgente-mayor by turn shall go the round and find the round and cintery not accomplish their to see they severe punish such as be plant on hill or high great consideration ought to by take for their due defence though the asendinge of such place by dificculte yet it be good they shall by compass with double palisado for their better security and with a parapet make of thurff or brick at the foot of each of they and way for the round betwixt they and the wall num. 5 for the more security of castle and strong place be most common plant in their front haulfe-mounes open on the inward side in which for their better security be wont of right to be agarde every day and night under which shelter the gate of the town or castle be make for their better security from the fury of the great ordnance as also for other respect and that they may discover the enemy and hinder their design it be very requisite that the or ditch be deep and broad enough and that the curtine be of good height that without great dificulte it can not be scale for the better asurance of all strong place it be necessary that they by well provide with strong and vigilant watch and for many good respect that no company which shall inter the watch shall know their a point place till the very time that the watch be set or alittle before for fear of treason by some provook by or proceed trough afronte or great injury receive from the governor touch their reputasion or honour or mean it also may proceed of some of bad and for which cause they be not prefer nor advance it may alsoe by invent by who bienge overmuch oppress with tyranny and find no conveniente remedy

they be people well know or not faithful or suspect in the ocurrante and course of war great and many be the require in the general of a army and in his counsel of war in prudent prevent many of great importance of present and future with aforcaste prudent prevention which otherwise bienge induce do often fall out to the great discomodity of his majesty service in atempte of many honourable interprise and incountere to the great decay of military discipline which by daily experience we see that for want of of care trust and fidelity many honourable interprise be lose result of the little perfection of many officeres a matter wourdie to be note examine and prevent for the due order of future ocasione of whate result that so many old and experiment of the late reformasione in germany and low country go on the contrary side to the great discomodity of the house of sense which time who many millone be consume in raise of neowe levy and recrute for the furtherance of the war of the low country yea to my judgemte as much as may entertain a invincible army of old and experiment souldore due pay and satisfy by daily experience we see that thigh neowe levy for the most part of service feowe be find to asiste which I have note and pit often time for bienge so great to his majesty service the omnipotent enlighten his majesty faithful minister in prevent in due time the conveniente course of a matter of so great importance and agreate enemy for the unprofitable consume of his majesty treasure and indies let none think that I disalue recrute and reforsinge of company in their due time and conveniente course profitable to his majesty service undeniable it be that a army well discipline order contend and conduct with prudent and brave comaunderes though lesh in number be by all reason masteres of the victory which all that write of this art do afirme and by daily experience we find to be true the repose and security of a kingdom or state depend for the most part in observe good law good war and continual practice of military discipline whereof their be very many probable example as plain happen to Anibal that renoom captain of war and to the invincibel roman that at length in neglect military discipline and exercise of arm be cause of their perdition and when they jest fear of any a tempe of their enemy and that result for biengc whole give to vice regality and repose and forgetful of all military exercise happy be that where good law and good discipline be in continual use and exercise and always ready for the prepare vice and malice of their enemy ready for the alarm when it shall present which often happen when we jest think upon happy be the prince and renoom the general who prudent do prevente the prepare malice and stratagem of their enemy and of future ocasione i doupte not but those of perfection and deep judgement in the art of war shall both admire and comende the extraordinary pain take for the due order of this wourke and in explicatinge and put to light many deep curiosity of rare importance in the office of the sardgente-mayor and ingiene of firewourkes as also the due and prudent order of several sort of weapon manadge in war all which with their neowe invent impalinge of shot and wing and their singular order to fight as also other deep curiosity of this art which be leifte in obscurity by many who write of this profession and that to disperte the ingeniouse wit of those incline to learn the rare and deep curiosity of military science that they may imitate they in optaininge their desire with long and continual practice and good which now I reduce to light in as much as military science the rule of mathematic and aritmeticke can afford with their general rule proof proporsione and table neow invent for that purpose plain show the reason of each particular brief declare in the table of the battle and in several figure cut in copper and wood plate not douptinge but those of perfect judgement in the deep and rare curiosity of this art will commend the same and a firm that as yet no do explicate more plain nor better of many particularity leifte in obscurity in firewourkes and special in the office of a sardgente mayor which now be reduse into the perfect form ordain for their in as much as military science and the general rule of the same can afourde so that such as be couriouse and incline to continual good aplicasione and determine by virtue prudente carriage and perfection in military discipline to by advance may in short time learn all the particularity in the office of a sardgente mayor leifte in obscurity by many which now in this wourcke be plain bring to light in as much as military science can afourde or declare which be not obtain by vain glory nor here say but rather with long and continual practice and in the theoric and practice of war with intent and desire to enlighten my belove countryman and othere that they may know how to acomplishe their with

common be wont to have good proceed and finish with a happy end suficiente example our irish nation give now of late for to imitate virtue plain deal and good religion by divine power bestow on that noble and renoom colonel Butler in prudent prevent the treachery and prepare malice of Valstene and his counselere against the house of Austria which the omnipotent bestow on he that special grace and that to be teach result of the undeniable truth and plain deal of his and his and of his renoomed captain and that be with he in that honourable enterprise of perpetual memory plain may it by understoude that thigh irish bienge so feowe in number that for the execute of so great so dangerous and almost unespect and impossible act of arm that it must by a gift bestwoe of the divine power for the benefit of truth and virtue of they and still groundinge and observe true religion and vertouse life so that they ward this renoomed warrior Valstene with ablowe of his mortal end with abucler invioren with divine defence and prosperity to the house of Austria and of perpetual renoome and glory to our irish nation the omnipotent enlighten we to imitate the undeniable true deal virtue and resolute determination of thigh famous warriere and othere of this nation incline to virtue and good example so that root rancour of invy slanderouse rail tongue and crouck malicious deal may not take place in equallinge themselves with the honourable of truth virtue good and military discipline but rather banish those incline to the wicked vice of inny mother of mischief and base result of barbarous proud blind ingnorance enemy to virtue truth and good proceed subject to quarrel bakbitinge murmur disgrace and bad example a penetrater of ranckored heart of unconsiderate understand little fear God or man of little conscience or reputation daily decayenge and falinge unto many odious crime and disgrace enemy to friendship and accord subject to afronte and vice of bad life and bad end and which of all thing be most untollerable and most odious in this noble profession of arm gentle reader you see who many good and probable example set down in many place of this wourcke for to imitate virtue and follow the step of the renoom prudent and valerouse soldier and that in many place you find sufficient example how many bear of low degree and base linadge have atain unto great degry dingnity and fame of perpetual memory and that result of their vertuse carriage renoom act resolute and continual good and by daily experience we see those incline to vice unruly fact and bad example do fall unto decay and many disgrace and be hate by those incline to virtue and most common such as do not amend do finish their life with a unhappy and miserable end so I take leave besech
