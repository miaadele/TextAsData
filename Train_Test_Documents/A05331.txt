JOHN LEO his first book of the description of Africa and of the memorable thing contain therein why this part of the world be name Africa Africa be call in the arabian tongue (@) of the word Faraca which signify in the say language to divide but why it shall be so call there be two opinion the first be this namely because this part of the world be divide from Europa by the Mediterran sea and from Asia * * * * * * * * * * * other divide it from Asia by the red sea by the river of Nilus other be of opinion that this name Africa be derive from one Ifricus the king of Arabia foelix who be say to have be the first that ever inhabit these part this Ifricus wage war against the king of Aslyria and be at length by he drive out of his kingdom pass with his whole army over Nilus and so conduct his troop westward make no delay till he be come unto the region lie about Carthage hence it be that the arabian do imagine the country about Carthage only and the region lie westward thereof to comprehend all Africa the border of Africa Africa if we may give credit unto the writer of that nation be man of learning and most skilful cosmographer begin southward at certain river issue forth of a lake in the desert of Gaoga eastward it border upon the river Nilus it extend northward to that part of Egypt where Nilus at seven mouth discharge his stream into the Mediterran sea from whence it stretch westward as far as the streite of Gibraltar and be bound on that part with the utmost sea-town of all Libya call * * * non. nun. likewise the south part thereof abut upon the ocean sea which compass Africa almost as far as the desert of Gaoga the (@) of Africa our author affirm that Africa be (@) into four part that be to say Barbaria Numidia Libya and the land of Negro Barbaria take beginning from the hill call meies which be the extreme part of all the mountain of Atlas be distant from Alexandria almost three hundred mile it be bound on the north side with the Mediterran sea stretch thence to mount-meies aforesaid and from mount-meies extend itself to the streite of Gibraltar westward it be limit with the say streite from whence wind itself out of the Mediterran sea into the main ocean it be enclose with the most westerly point of Atlas namely at that western cape which be next unto the town call messa and southward it be bound with that side of Atlas which lie towards the Mediterran sea this be the most noble and worthy region of all Africa the inhabitant whereof be of a brown or tawny colour be a civil people and prescribe wholesome law and constitution unto themselves the second part of Africa be call of the latin Numidia but of the arabian Biledulgerid this region bring forth date in great abundance it begin eastward at the city of which be a hundred mile distant from Egypt and extend west as far as the town of * * * (@) nun stand upon the ocean sea northward it be enclose with the south side of Atlas and the south part thereof border upon the sandy desert of Libya all the arabian do usual call it the land of date because this only region of Africa bear date the three part call of the latin Libya and of the arabian sarra which word signify a desert begin eastward at that part of Nilus which be next unto the city of and from thence run westward as far as the ocean sea northward it be bound with Numidia southward it abut upon the land of negro eastward it take beginning at the kingdom of Gaoga and stretch westward even to the land of Gualata which border upon the ocean sea the four part of Africa which be call the land of negro begin eastward at the kingdom of Gaoga from whence it extend west as far as Gualata the north part thereof be enclose with the desert of Libya and the south part which be unknown unto we with the ocean sea howbeit the merchant which daily come from thence to the kingdom of Tombuto have sufficient describe the situation of that country unto we this land of Negro have a mighty river which take his the (@) of Niger name of the region be call Niger this river take his original from the east out of a certain desert call by the foresay negro seu. other will have this river to spring out of a certain lake and so to run westward till it exonerate itself into the ocean sea our cosmographer affirm that the say river of Niger be derive out of Nilus which they imagine for some certain space to be swallow up of the earth and yet at last to burst forth into such a lake as be before mention some other be of opinion that this river begin westward to spring out of a certain mountain and so run east to make at length a huge lake which very be not like to be true for they usual sail westward from Tombuto to the kingdom of Ginea yea and to the land of also both which in respect of Tombuto be situate to the west neither have the say land of negro any kingdom comparable for beautiful and pleasant soil unto those which adjoin unto the bank of Niger and here it be to be note that according to the opinion of our cosmographer * * * Aethiopia that land of negro by which Nilus be say to run namely that part of the world which stretch eastward even to the indian sea some northerly parcel whereof abut upon the red sea to wit the country which lie without the gulf of Arabia be not to be call any member or portion of Africa and that for many reason which be to be find in the process of this history set down more at large the say country be call by the latin Aethiopia from thence come certain religious friar sear or brand on the face with a hot iron who be to be see almost over all Europe and special at Rome these people have a emperor which they call Prete Gianni the great part of that land be inhabit with christian howbeit there be also a certain mahometan among they which be say to possess a great dominion a division of the four forename part of Africa BArbarie be distinguish into four kingdom the first whereof be the kingdom of Maroco which be likewise divide into seven region or province namely Hea Sus Guzula the territory of Maroco Duccala and tedle the second kingdom of Barbary call Fez comprehendeth in like sort seven region within the bound thereof to wit Temesne the territory of Fez Azgara * * * Errif garet and * * * Elcauz the three kingdom be call * * * tremizen Telensin and have three region under it namely the mountain tenez and Algezer the four kingdom of Barbary be name Tunis under which be comprise four region that be to say Bugia Constantina Tripoli in Barbary and Ezzaba which be a good part of Numidia Bugia have always be turmoil with continual war because sometime it be subject unto the king of Tunis and sometime again unto the king of tremizen certain it be that even until these our day this Bugia be a kingdom of itself and so continue till the principal city of that region be at the commandment of Ferdinando the king of Castille take by one Peter of Navarre the division of Numidia this be the base part of all Africa neither will our cosmographer vouchsafe it the name of a kingdom by reason that the inhabitant thereof be so far distant asunder which you may easy conjecture by that which follow a city of Numidia contain about four hundred family and be in regard of the libyan desert sever from all place of habitation almost three hundred mile wherefore this second part be think by diverse not to be worthy the name of a kingdom howbeit we will make some relation of the habitable part of Numidia some whereof may not unfit be compare with other region of Africa as for example that of Segelmess which territory of Numidia lie over against Barbary likewise zeb which be situate against Bugia and the signiory of Biledulgerid which extend unto the kingdom of Tunis reserve therefore many particular for the second part of this history we will make our entry and beginning at those place which lie upon the west of Numidia the name whereof be these Guaden Ifren Hacca dare Tebelbelt Todga Fercale Segelmess Benigumi Fighig Tegua Tegorarin Mesab Tegort and Guarghela the region of zeb contain five town to wit Pescara Elborgh nesta Taolac and deusin so many city likewise have the territory of Biledulgerid namely Teozar Caphesa Nefreoa elchamid and Chalbis and from hence eastward be find the isle of gerbe Garion Mesellata Mestrata Teoirraga Gademis Fizza Augela Birdeoa and eloacat these be the name of the most famous place of all Numidia be bound as be say before westward upon the ocean sea and eastward with the river of Nilus a description of the libyan desert which lie between Numidia and the (@) of Negro these desert have not as yet any certain name among we (@) they be divide into five part and receive all their denomination from the inhabitant which dwell upon they that be to say from the numidian who be in like sort themselves divide into five part also to wit the people or tribe call Zanega Ganziga Leuta and Berdeoa there be likewise certain place which take some proper and particular name from the goodness and badness of the soil as namely the desert of Azaohad so call for the drought and unfruitfulness of that place likewise hair albeit a desert yet so call for the goodness and temperature of the air a division of the land of negro into several kingdom moreover the land of Negro be divide into many kingdom whereof albeit a great part be unknown unto we and remove far out of our trade we will notwithstanding make relation of those place where we ourselves have abode and which by long experience be grow very familiar unto we as likewise of some other place from whence merchant use to travel unto the same city wherein myself be then resident from who I learn right (@) the state of their country I * * * * * * * * * * * * John (@) over (@) (@) of the (@) of Negro myself see fifteen kingdom of the negro howbeit there be many more which although I see not with my own eye yet be they by the negro sufficient know and frequent their name therefore beginning from the west and so proceed eastward and southward be these follow Gualata Ghinea Tombuto Gago Guber Agadez canon Casena Zegzeg Zanfara Guangara Burno Gaoga these fifteen kingdom be for the most part situate upon the river Niger through the which merchant usual travel from Gualata to the city of * * * cairo alcair in Egypt the journey indeed be very long but yet secure and void of danger all the say kingdom adjoin one upon another ten whereof be separate either by the river Niger or by some sandy desert and in time past each one of the fifteen have a several king but now * * * * * * about the year 1526. at this present they be all in a manner subject unto three king only namely to the king of Tombuto who be lord of the great part to the king of Borno who govern the least part and the residue be in subjection unto the king of Gaoga howbeit he that possess the kingdom of Ducala have a very small train attend upon he likewise these kingdom have many other kingdom border upon the south frontier of they to wit Bito Dauma Medra and Gorhan the governor and inhabitant whereof be most rich and industrious people great lover of justice and equity albeit some lead a brutish kind of life of the habitation of Africa and of the signification of this word Barbar our cosmographer and historiographer affirm that in time past Africa be altogether disinhabit except that part which be now call the land of negro and most certain it be that Barbary and Numidia be for many age destitute of inhabitant the tawny people of the say region be call by the name of barber be derive of the verb Barbara which in their tongue signify to murmur because the african tongue sound in the ear of the arabian no otherwise than the voice of beast which utter their sound without any accent other will have barber to be one word twice repeat forsomuch as bar in the arabian tongue signify a desert for say they when king Iphricus be by the assyrian or aethiopian drive out of his own kingdom travel towards Egypt and see himself so oppress with his enemy that he know not what shall become of he and his follower he ask his people how or which way it be possible to escape who answer he barber that be to the desert to the desert give he to understand by this speech that he can have no safe refuge then to cross over Nilus and to flee unto the desert of Africa and this reason seem to agree with they which affirm the african to be descend from the people of Arabia the original of the people of Africa about the original of the african our historiographer do much disagree for some will have they to be derive from the inhabitant of palaestina because as they say be expel out of their own country by the assyrian they come at length into Africa and see the fruitfulness of the soil choose it to be their place of habitation other be of opinion that they take their original from the sabean a people of Arabia and that before such time as they be put to flight by the assyrian or aethiopian as have be aforesaid some other report that the african descend from certain people of * * * * * Asia who be chase thence by reason of war which be wage against they flee into Greece which at the same time have no inhabitant at all howbeit the enemy still pursue they they be force to cross the sea of Morea and be arrive in Africa to settle themselves there but their enemy abode still in Greece all which opinion and report be to be understand only of the original of the tawny people that be to say of the numidian and barbarian for all the negro or black moor take their descent from Chus the son of cham who be the son of Noe but whatsoever difference there be between the negro and the tawny moor certain it be that they have all one beginning for the negro be descend of the Philistine and the Philistine of Mesraim the * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Genesis the 10. v the 6. Mezraim be account the (@) of Chus son of Chus but the tawny moor fetch their pedigree from the sabean and it be evident that Saba be beget of * * * * * gen. 10. 7. which be the elder son of Chus diverse other opinion there be as touch this matter which because they seem not so necessary we have purposely omit a division of the tawny moor into sundry tribe or nation the tawny moor be divide into five several people or tribe to wit the tribe call zanhagi Musmudi Zeneti Hacari and Gumeri the tribe of Musmudi inhabit the western part of mount Atlas from the province of Hea to the river of * * * guadalhabit seruan likewise they dwell upon the south part of the say mountain and upon all the inward plain of that region these have four province under they namely Hea Sus Guzula and the territory of Morocco the tribe of Gumeri possess certain mountain of Barbary dwell on the side of those mountain which lie over against the Mediterran sea as likewise they be lord of all the river call in their language rif. this river tremizen call by the ancient cosmographer Caesaria or Mauritania caesariensis have his fountain near unto the streite of Gibraltar and thence run eastward to the kingdom of tremizen call by the latin Caesaria these two tribe or people have several habitation by themselves the other three be disperse confusive over all Africa howbeit they be like stranger discern one from another by certain property or token maintain continual war among themselves especial they of Numidia these I say be those very people as some report who have no other place than tent and wide field to repose themselves in and it be report that in time past they have great conflict together and that the vanquish be send to inhabit town and city but the conqueror hold the champion and field unto themselves and there settle their abode neither be it altogether unlikely because the inhabitant of city have all one and the same language with the country people for the zeneti whether they dwell in the city or in the country speak all one kind of language which be likewise to be understand of the rest the tribe of Zeneti Haoari and Sanhagi inhabit the country of Temesne sometime they live peaceable and sometime again call to mind their ancient quarrel they break forth into cruel war and manslaughter some of these people bear rule over all Africa as namely the zeneti who in time past vanquish the family call idris from which some affirm the true and natural duke of Fez and the founder of the same city to derive their pedigree their progeny likewise be call Mecnasa there come afterward out of Numidia another family of the zeneti call Magraoa this Magraoa chase the family of Mecnasa with all their duke and chieftain out of their dominion not long after the say tribe of Magraoa be expel in like sort by certain other of the race of the call by the name of Luntuna which come also out of the desert of Numidia by this family be the country of Temesna in process of time utter spoil and waste and all the inhabitant thereof slay except those which be of their own tribe and kindred of Luntuna unto who be allot the region of Ducala to inhabit and by they be build the city common call Maroco it fall out afterward by the who be the founder of Maroco inconstancy of fortune that one Elmahdi the principal (@) preacher among they conspire with the these be of the family of Musmuda expel the whole race of the and usurp that kingdom unto himself after this man decease succeed in his place one of his disciple call habdul Mumen a Banigueriaghel of the kindred of the the kingdom remain unto this family about a 120. year whereunto all Africa in a manner be subject at length be depose by the Banimarini a generation of the zeneti the say family be put to flight which Banimarini be say to have reign afterward for the space of 170. year the Banimarini which descend of the and of Magroa wage continual war against banizeijan the king of Telensin likewise the progeny of Hafasa and of Musmuda be at variance and dissension with the king of Tunis so that you see what stir and tumult have at all time be occasion in those region by the foresay five family certain it be that neither the nor the Haoari have at this present any jurisdiction at all albeit heretofore as we read in their chronicle they have some certain dominion before such time as they be infect with the mahometan law out of all which it be evident that in time past all the foresay people have their habitation and tent in the plain field every one of which favour their own faction and exercise all labour necessary for man life as common among they the governor of the country attend their drove and flock and the citizen apply themselves unto some manual art or to husbandry the say people be divide into five hundred several family as appear by the genealogy of the african author whereof be one Rachu who I have oftentimes read and peruse some writer be of opinion that the king of Tombuto the king of and the king of Agadez fetch their original from the people of Zanaga to wit from they which inhabit the desert the agreement or variety of the african language the foresay five family or people (@) divide into hundred of progeny and have innumerable habitation do notwithstanding use all one kind of language call by they Aquel Amarig that be the noble tongue the arabian Aquel Amarig which inhabit Africa call it a barbarous tongue and this be the true and natural language of the african howbeit it be altogether different from other language although it have diverse word common with the arabian tongue whereupon some will infer that the african as be above say come by lineal descent from the sabean a people of Arabia other say that these word be even then invent when the arabian come first into Africa and begin to take possession thereof but these author be so rude and grossewitted that they leave no write behind they which may be allege either for or against moreover they have among they another diversity not only of (@) but of significant word also as namely they which dwell near unto the arabian and exercise much traffic with they do for the great part use their language yea all the in a manner and most of the Haoari speak Arabian though corrupt which I suppose come first hereupon to pass for that the say people have have long acquaintance and conversation with the arabian the negro have diverse language among themselves among which they call one Sungai and the same be current in many region as namely in Gualata Tombuto Ghinea and Gago another language there be among the negro which they call Guber and this be rife among the people of Guber of canon of Casena of Perzegreg and of Guangra likewise the kingdom of Borno have a peculiar kind of speech altogether like unto that which be use in Gaoga and the kingdom of have a language of great affinity with the chaldean arabian and egyptian tongue but all the sea-town of Africa from the Mediterran sea to the mountain of Atlas speak break arabian except the kingdom and town of Maroco and the inland numidian border upon Maroco Fez and tremizen all which use the barbarian tongue howbeit they which dwell over against Tunis and Tripoli speak indeed the arabian language albeit most corrupt of the arabian inhabit the city of Africa of that army which be send by Califa * * * (@) otman the three in the four hundred year of the Hegeira there come into Africa fourscore thousand gentleman and other who have subdue sundry province at length arrive in Africa and there the general of the whole army call * * * (@) Hucha (@) nafich remain this man build that great city which be call of we * * * Cairaoan alcair for he stand in fear of the people of Tunis lest they shall betray he misdoubt also that they will procure aid out of Sicily and so give he the encounter wherefore with all his treasure which he have get he travel to the desert and firm ground distant from * * * Tunis Carthage about one hundred and twenty mile and there be he say to have build the city of * * * (@) alcair the remnant of his soldier he command to keep those place which be most secure and fit for their defence and will they to build where no rock nor fortification be which be do the arabian begin to inhabit Africa and to disperse themselves among the african who because they have be for certain year subject unto the roman or italian use to speak their language and hence it be that the natural and mothertoong of the arabian which have great affinity with the african tongue grow by little and little to be corrupt and so they report that these two nation at length conjoin themselves in one howbeit the arabian usual do blaze their pedigree in daily and trivial song which custom as yet be common both to * * * * * * the moor of Granada we and to the people of Barbary also for no man there be be he never so base which will not to his own name add the name of his nation as for example arabian barbarian or such like of the arabian which dwell in tent the mahometan priest always forbid the arabian to pass over Nilus with their army and tent how be it in the four hundred year of the Hegeira we read that they be permit so to do by a certain factious and schismatical * * * * * a (@) patriarch Califa because one of his noble have rebel against he usurp the city of cairaoan and the great part of Barbary after the death of which rebel that kingdom remain for some year unto his posterity and family who jurisdiction as the african chronicle report grow so large and strong in the time of Elcain the mahometan Califa and patriarch of Arabia that he send unto they one gehoar who of a slave he have make his counsellor gehoar a slave by condition conquer all Barbary Numidia Egypt and Syria with a huge army this gehoar conduct his army westward recover all Numidia and Barbary insomuch that he pierce unto the region of Sus and there claim most ample tribute all which be do he return back unto his Calipha and most faithful surrender unto he whatsoever he have gain from the enemy the Calipha see his prosperous success begin to aspire unto great exploit and gehoar most firm promise that as he have recover that western dominion unto his lord so will he likewise by force of war most certain restore unto he the country of the east to wit Egypt Syria and all Arabia and protest moreover that with the great hazard of his life he will be avenge of all the injury offer by the family of unto his lord predecessor and will revest he in the royal seat of his most famous grandfather great-grandfather and progenitor the Calipha like well his audacious promise cause a army of fower-score thousand soldier with a infinite sum of money and other thing necessary for the war to be deliver unto he and so this valiant and stout chieftain be provide for warfare conduct his troop through the desert of Egypt and Barbary and have first (@) to flight the vice-califa of Egypt who flee unto Eluir the Califa of Bagdet in short time he subdue very easy all the province of Egypt and Syria howbeit he can not as yet hold himself secure fear lest the Califa of Bagdet will assail he with a army out of Asia and lest the garrison which he have leave to keep Barbary shall be constrain to forsake those conquer province wherefore he build (@) and cause it to be wall round about in which city he leave one of his most trusty captain with a great part of the army and this gehoar the first (@) of cairo city he call by the name of alchair which afterward by other be name cairo this alchair be say daily so to have increase that no city of the world for building and inhabitant be any way comparable thereunto now when Gehoar perceive that the Calipha of Bagdet make no preparation for war he forthwith write unto his lord that all the conquer city yield due honour unto he and that all thing be in quiet and tranquillity and therefore that himself if he think good shall come over into Egypt and thereby with his only presence shall prevail more to recover the remnant of his dominion then with never so huge a army for he be in good hope that the Calipha of Bagdet hear of his expedition will leave his kingdom and prelacy and will betake himself to flight this notable and joyful message no soon come to the ear of Califa Elcain but he be by his good fortune much more encourage then before and not forethink himself what mischief may ensue levy a great army appoint for viceroy of all Barbary one of the family of Sanagia aforesaid find he afterward not to be his trusty friend moreover Califa Elcain arrive at alchair and be most honourable entertain by his servant gehoar begin to think upon great affair and have gather a huge army resolve to wage battle against the Califa of Bagdet in the mean season he that be appoint viceroy of Barbary compact with the Calipha of Bagdet yield himself and all Barbary into his hand which the Califa most kind accept and ordain he king over all Africa but Califa Elcain hear this news at alchair be wonderful afflict in mind partly because he see himself repel from his own kingdom and partly for that he have spend all his money which he bring with he insomuch that he know not what in the world to do determine some severe punishment for gehoar by who counsel he leave his kingdom of Arabia howbeit there be one of his secret counsellor a very learned and witty man who see his lord so sad and pensive and be desirous by some good advice to prevent the danger imminent comfort he in this wise your highness know most invincible Califa that fortune be most variable and that the courage of your soldier be no whit daunt by reason of these mishap for i own part as I have heretofore show myself to be your trusty servant so will I at this time give you such profitable counsel whereby you may within short space recover all those dominion which have be so treacherous take from you and may without all peradventure most easy attain unto your own heart desire and this you may do without maintain any army at all yea I assure you if you please to take my advice that I will forthwith procure you such a army as shall give you great store of money and yet notwithstanding shall do you good service also the Califa be somewhat (@) these speech ask his counsellor how this may possible be bring to effect my lord say his counsellor certain it be that the arabian be now grow so populous and to so great a number that all Arabia can contain they scarce will the yearly increase of the ground suffice to feed their drove and you see with what great famine they be afflict and how they be destitute not only of habitation but even of victual and sustenance wherefore if you have heretofore give they leave they will long ere this have invade Africa and if you will now license they so to do doubt you not but that you shall receive of they a huge mass of gold this counsel can not altogether satisfy the Califa his mind for he know right well that the arabian will so waste all Africa as it shall neither be profitable for himself nor for his enemy notwithstanding see that his kingdom be altogether endanger he think it better to accept those sum of money which his counsellor promise and so to be revenge of his enemy then to lose both his kingdom and gold all at once wherefore he permit all arabian which will pay he ducat apiece free to enter Africa conditional that they will show themselves most deadly enemy unto the treacherous king of Barbary which liberty ten tribe of arabian (@) Africa be grant unto they it be report that ten tribe or family of arabian be half the people of Arabia come immediate into Africa unto who certain inhabitant of Arabia join themselves insomuch that there be find among they about fifty thousand person able to bear arm their woman child and cattle be (@) Rachu a (@) (@) almost innumerable the story whereof Ibnu Rachu the most diligent chronicler of african affair who we have before mention set down at large these arabian have traverse the desert between Egypt and Barbary first lay siege unto Tripoli a city of Barbary which be overcome they slay a great part of the citizen the residue escape by flight next of all they encounter the town of cape which be by they take and vanquish at length they besiege cairaoan also howbeit the citizen be sufficient provide of victual be say to have endure the siege for eight month which be expire they be constrain to yield at what time there be nothing in cairaoan but woeful slaughter hideous outcry and present death this land the arabian divide among themselves and begin to people and inhabit the same require in the mean space large tribute of the town and province subject unto they and so they possess all Africa until such time as one joseph the son of jeffin attain to the kingdom of Morocco this joseph be the first king of Morocco who endeavour by all mean to advance the friend and kindred of the late decease king of Africa unto the kingdom neither do he cease until he have expel all the arabian out of Cairaoan howbeit the arabian possess the region thereabouts give themselves whole to spoil and robbery and the friend of the say decease king can bear rule but in certain place only afterwards succeed in the kingdom of Morocco one Mansor who be the four king and prelate of that mahometan sect which be call muachedim this man albeit his grandfather and great grandfather have always favour the posterity and friend of the foresay decease african king and have restore they to their ancient dignity devise altogether how to oppose himself against they and to usurp all their authority wherefore make a feign league with they we read that he provoke the arabian against they and so very easy overcome they afterwards Mansor bring the great part of the arabian into the western dominion of Africa unto the better sort of who he give the habitation of Duccala and Azgara and unto the base remnant he bequeath the possession of Numidia but in process of time he command the numidian slave to be set at liberty and so in despite of the arabian he cause they to inhabit that part of Numidia which he have allot unto they but as for the arabian of Azgara and of certain other place in Barbary he bring they all under his subjection for the arabian out of desert be like fish without water they have indeed often attempt to get into the desert but the mountain of Atlas which be then possess by the barbarian hinder their passage neither have they liberty to pass over the plain for the residue of the barbarian be there plant wherefore their pride be abate they apply themselves unto husbandry have no where to repose themselves but only in village cottage and tent and their misery be so much the great in that they be constrain yearly to disburse unto the king of Morocco most ample tribute those which inhabit Duccala because they be a huge multitude easy free themselves from all tribute and imposition a great part of the arabian remain still at Tunis for that Mansor have refuse to carry they along with he who after the death of the say Mansor grow to be lord of Tunis and so continue till they resign their government unto the people call abu-haf upon condition that they shall pay they half the revenue thereof and this condition have remain firm even until our day howbeit because the arabian be increase to such innumerable swarm that the whole revenue be not sufficient for they the king of Tunis most just allow some of 1526. they their duty to the end they may make secure passage for merchant which indeed they perform without molestation or hurt of any but the residue which be deprive of their pay betake themselves whole to robbery theft slaughter and such other monstrous outrage for these lurk always in the wood no soon see any merchant approach but sudden they break forth deprive he of his good and life also insomuch that now merchant dare not pass that way but with a garrison of safe-conduct and so they pass sometime to their great inconvenience for they be notwithstanding constrain to give unto the foresay arabian which be in pay with the king of Tunis great sum of money and be likewise oftentimes so in danger of robber that they lose both their good and life adivision of the arabian which inhabit Africa and be call by the name of barbarian into diverse progeny or kindred the arabian which inhabit Africa be divide into three part one part whereof be call Cachin the second hilell and the three Machill the Cachin be divide into three nation or tribe to wit the tribe of Etheg Sumait and sahid moreover Etheg be divide into three family that be to say the family of Delleg Elmuntefig and Subair and these be disperse into many region Hilel be derive into four generation to wit the people of Benihemir of Rieh of Sufien and of chusain the family of Benihemir be divide into the lineage of Huroam Hucben and the tribe of Rieh be distribute into the kindred call Deuvad suay asgeg Elcherith Enedri and Garfam which kindred possess many dominion Machil have three tribe under they to wit Mastar hutman and hassan Mastar be divide into Ruchen and Selim hutman into Elhasi and Chinan and hassan into Devihessen Devimansor and Devihubaidulla Devihessen be distinguish into the kindred call Dulein Berbun Vodein racman and Hamram Devimansor into Hemrun Menebbe Husein and Albuhusein and last devihubaidulla into Garag Hedeg Teleb and Geoan all these do in a manner possess innumerable region insomuch that to reckon they up at large be a matter not only difficult but almost impossible of the habitation and number of the foresay arabian the most noble and famous arabian be they of the family of Etheg unto who Almansor give the region of Duccala and of tedle to inhabit these arabian even till our time have be put to great distress and hazard partly by the Portugal king and partly by the king of Fez. they have at all opportunity if need shall require a hundred thousand soldier fit to bear arm a great part whereof be horseman the arabian call sumait enjoy that part of the libyan desert which lie over against the desert of Tripoli these make often invasion into Barbary for they have no place allot they therein but they and their camel do perpetual remain in the desert they be able to levy fourscore thousand soldier the great part be footman likewise the tribe of Sahid do inhabit the desert of Libya and these have have always great league and familiarity with the king of Guargala they have such abundance of cattle that they do plentiful supply all the city of that region with flesh and that especial in summer time for all the winter they stir not out of the desert their number be increase to about a hundred and fifty thousand have not many horseman among they the tribe of Delleg possess diverse habitation howbeit * * * (@) Caesaria contain the great part of they some also inhabit upon the frontier of the kingdom of Bugia who be say to receive a yearly stipend from their next neighbour but the least part of they dwell upon the field-countrey of acde upon the border of Mauritania and upon some part of mount Atlas be subject unto the king of Fez. the people of Elmuntefig be seat in the province of azgar and be call by the late writer Elcaluth these also pay certain yearly tribute unto the king of Fez be able to furnish about eight thousand horseman to the war the kindred of Sobair do inhabit not far from the kingdom of gezeir be many of they under the pay of the king of tremizen and be say to

Gehoan inhabit not all in one place for part of they you may find among the people of Guarag and the residue among the people of Hedeg and they be unto they no otherwise then their servant which condition they notwithstanding most patient and willing submit themselves unto and here one thing be to be note by the way to wit that the two forename people call * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * the arabian call (@) and (@) descend from Ishmael the base son of Abraham Schachin and Hilel be original arabian of Arabia and think themselves to be descend from Ishmael the son of Abraham and those which we call Machil come first forth of Arabia and derive their pedigree from Saba before who the mahometan prefer the former which of Ishmael be call ismaelite and because the arabian call (@) descend of Saba there have always be great controverfie among they which part shall be of great nobility they have write on both side many dialogue and epigram whereby each man be wont to blaze the renown the virtuous manner and laudable custom of his own nation the ancient arabian which be before the time of the ismaelite be call by the african historiographer arabi-araba as if a man shall say arabian of Arabia but those which come of Ishmael they call Arabi mus-araba as if they shall say arabian ingraff into the land of Arabia or arabian accidental because they be not original breed and bear in Arabia and then which afterward come into Africa they name in their language mustehgeme that be barbarous arabian and that because they join themselves unto stranger insomuch that not only their speech but their manner also be most corrupt and barbarous these be friendly reader the particular which for these ten year my memory can reserve as touch the original and diversity of the african and arabian in all which time I remember not that ever I read or see any history of that nation he that will know more let he have recourse unto Hibnu Rachu the historiographer beforenamed the manner and custom of the african people which inhabit the desert of Libya those five kind of people before rehearse to wit the people the people of Numidia of Zenega of Gansiga of of Leuta and of Bardeoa be call of the latin Numidae and they live all after one manner that be to say without all law and civility their garment be a narrow and base piece of cloth wherewith scarce half their body be cover some of they wrap their head in a kind of black cloth as it be with a scarf such as the turk use which be common call a turban such as will be discern from the common sort for gentleman wear a jacket make of blue cotton with wide sleeve and cotton-cloth be bring unto they by certain merchant from the land of Negro they have no beast fit to ride upon except their camel unto who nature between the bunch stand upon the hinder part of their back and their neck have allot a place which may fit serve to ride upon in stead of a saddle their manner of ride be most ridiculous for sometime they lay their leg across upon the camel neck and sometime again have no knowledge nor regard of stirrup they rest their foot upon a rope which be cast over his shoulder in stead of spur they use a truncheon of a cubit length have at the one end thereof a goad wherewith they prick only the shoulder of their camel those camel which they use to ride upon have a hole bore through the gristle of their nose in the which a ring of leather be fasten whereby as with a bit they be more easy curb and master after which manner I have see buffle use in Italy for bed they lie upon mat make of sedge and bulrush their tent be cover for the most part with course chamlet or with a harsh kind of wool which common grow upon the bough of their date-tree as for their manner wool grow upon the palm tree of live it will seem to any man incredible what hunger and scarcity this nation will endure bread they have none at all neither use they any seethe or roast their food be camel milk only and they desire no other dainty for their breakfast they drink off a great cup of camel milk for supper they have certain dry flesh steep in butter and milk whereof each man take his share eat it out of his fist and that this their meat may not stay long undigested in their stomach they sup off the foresay broth wherein their flesh be steep for which purpose they use the palm of their hand as a most fit instrument frame by nature to the same end after that each one drink his cup of milk and so their supper have a end these numidian while they have any store of milk regard water nothing at all which for the most part happen in the spring of the year all which time you shall find some among they that will neither wash their hand nor their face which seem not altogether to be unlikely for as we say before while their milk last they frequent not those place where water be common yea and their camel so long as they may feed upon grass will drink no water at all they spend their whole day in hunt and thieve for all their endeavour and exercise be to drive away the camel of their enemy neither will they remain above three day in one place by reason that they have not pasture any long for the sustenance of their camel and albeit as be aforesaid they have no civility at all nor any law prescribe unto they yet have they a certain governor or prince place over they unto who they render obedience and due honour as unto their king they be not only ignorant of all good learning and liberal science but be likewise altogether careless and destitute of virtue insomuch that you shall find scarce one among they all which be a man of judgement or counsel and if any injury party will go to the law with his adversary he must ride continual five or six day before he can come to the speech of any judge this nation have all learning and good discipline in such contempt that they will not once vouchsafe to go out of their desert for the study and attain thereof neither if any learned man shall chance to come among they can they love his company and conversation in regard of their most rude and detestable behaviour howbeit if they can find any judge which can frame himself to live and continue among they to he they give most large yearly allowance some allow their judge a thousand ducat yearly some more and some less according as themselves think good they that will seem to be account of the better sort cover their head as I say before with a piece of black cloth part whereof like a vizard or mask reach down over their face cover all their countenance except their eye and this be their daily kind of attire and so often as they put meat into their mouth they remove the say mask which be do they forth with cover their mouth again allege this fond reason for say they as it be unseemly for a man after he have receive meat into his stomach to vomit it out of his mouth again and to cast it upon the earth even so it be a undecent part to eat meat with a man mouth uncover the woman of this nation be gross corpulent and of a swart complexion they be fat upon their breast and pap but slender about the girdle (@) very civil they be after their manner both in speech and gesture sometime they will accept of a kiss but whoso tempt they far put his own life in hazard for by reason of jealousy you may see they daily one to be the death and destruction of another and that in such savage and brutish manner that in this case they will show no compassion at all and they seem to be more wise in this behalf then diverse of our people for they will by no mean match themselves unto a harlot the liberality of this people have at all time be exceed great and when any traveller may pass through their dry and desert territory they will never repair unto their tent neither will they themselves travel upon the common high way and if any carovan or multitude of merchant will pass those desert they be bind to pay certain custom unto the prince of the say people namely for every camel load a piece of cloth worth a ducat upon a time I remember that travel in the company of certain merchant over the desert call by they araoan it be our chance there to meet with the prince of Zanaga who after he have receive his due custom invite the say company of merchant for their recreation to go and abide with he in his tent four or five day howbeit because his tent be too far out of our way and for that we shall have wander far than we think good esteem it more convenient for we to hold on our direct course we refuse his gentle offer and for his courtesy give he great thanks but not be satisfy therewith he command that our camel shall proceed on forward but the merchant he carry along with he and give they very sumptuous entertainment at his place of abode where we be no soon arrive but this good prince cause camel of all kind and ostrich (@) and (@) use (@) victual which he have hunt and take by the way to be kill for his household provision howbeit we request he not to make such daily slaughter of his camel affirm moreover that we never use to eat the flesh of a geld camel but when all other victual fail we whereunto he answer that he shall deal uncivil if he welcome so worthy and so seldome-seene guest with the kill of small cattle only wherefore he wish we to fall to such provision as be set before we here may you have see great plenty of roast and sodden flesh their roast ostrich be bring to the table in wicker platter be season with sundry kind of herb and spice their bread make of mill and panic be of a most savoury and pleasant taste and always at the end of dinner or supper we have plenty of date and great store of milk serve in yea this bountiful and noble prince that he may sufficient show how welcome we be unto he will together with his nobility always bear we company howbeit we ever dine and sup apart by ourselves moreover he cause certain religious and most learned man to come unto our banquet who all the time we remain with the say prince use not to eat any bread at all but feed only upon flesh and milk whereat we be somewhat amaze the good prince gentle tell we that they all be bear in such place whereas no kind of grain will grow howbeit that himself for the entertainment of stranger have great plenty of corn lay up in store wherefore he bid we to be of good cheer say that (@) will eat only of such thing as his own native soil afford affirm moreover that bread be yet in use among they at their feast of Passover and at other feast also whereupon they use to offer sacrifice and thus we remain with he for the space of two day all which time what wonder and magnificent cheer we have make we will seem incredible to report but the three day be desirous to take our leave the prince accompany we to that place where we overtake our camel and company send before and this I dare most deep take my oath on that we spend the say prince ten time more than our custom which he receive come to we think it not amiss here to set down this history to declare in some sort the courtesy and liberality of the say nation neither can the prince aforesaid understand our language nor we he but all our speech to and fro be make by a interpreter and this which we have here record as touch this nation be likewise to be understand of the other four nation above mention which be disperse over the residue of the numidian desert the manner and custom of the arabian which inhabit Africa the arabian as they have sundry mansion and place of abode so do they live after a diverse and sundry manner those which inhabit between Numidia and Libya lead a most miserable and distress life differ much in this regard from those african who we affirm to dwell in Libya howbeit they be far more valiant than the say african and use common to exchange camel in the land of negro where the Barbary horse be breed they have likewise great store of horse which in Europe they call horse of Barbary they take wonder delight in hunt and pursue of dear of wild ass of ostrich and such like neither be it here to be omit that the great part of arabian which inhabit Numidia be very witty and conceit in pen of verse wherein each man will decipher arabian poem and verse his love his hunt his combat and other his worthy act and this be do for the most part in rhyme after the italian manner and albeit it they be most liberal mind yet dare they not by bountiful give make any show of wealth for they be daily oppress with manifold inconvenience they be apparel after the numidian fashion save that their woman differ somewhat from the woman of Numidia those desert which they do now enjoy be wont to be possess by african but the arabian with their army invade that part of Africa drive out the natural numidian and reserve the desert adjoin upon the land of date unto themselves but the numidian begin to inhabit those desert which border upon the land of Negro the arabian which dwell between mount Atlas and the Mediterran sea be far wealthy than these which we now speak of both for costliness of apparel for good horse-meat and for the stateliness and beauty of their tent their horse also be of better shape and more corpulent but not so swift as the horse of the numidian desert they exercise husbandry and have great increase of corn their drove and flock of cattle be innumerable insomuch that they can inhabit one by another for want of pasture they be somewhat more vile and barbarous than those which inhabit the desert and yet they be not altogether destitute of liberality part of they which dwell in the territory of Fez be subject unto the king of Fez. those which remain in Morocco and Duccala have continue this long time free from all exaction and tribute but so soon as the king of Portugal begin to bear rule over Azafi and Azamor there begin also among they strife and civil war wherefore be assail by the king of Portugal on the one side and by the king of Fez on the other and be oppress also with the extreme famine and scarcity of that year they be bring unto such misery that they free offer themselves as the arabian offer themselves slave to any that will relieve their extreme hunger slave unto the portugal submit themselves to any man that be willing to relieve their intolerable hunger and by this mean scarce one of they be leave in all moreover those which possess the desert border upon the kingdom of tremizen and Tunis may all of they in regard of the rest be call nobleman and gentleman for their governor receive every year great revenue from the king of Tunis divide the same afterward among their people to the end they may avoid all discord and by this mean all dissension be eschew and peace be keep firm and inviolable among they they have notable dexterity and cunning both in make of tent and in bring up and keep of horse in summer time they usual come near unto Tunis to the end that each man may provide himself of bread armour and other necessary all which they carry with they into the desert remain there the whole winter in the spring of the year they apply themselves to hunt insomuch that no beast can escape their pursuit myself I remember be once at their tent to my no little danger and inconvenience where I see great quantity of cloth brass iron and copper than a man shall oftentimes find in the most rich warehouse of some city howbeit no trust be to be give unto they for if occasion serve they will play the thief most sly and cunning notwithstanding they seem to carry some show of civility they take great delight in poetry and will pen most excellent verse their language be very pure and elegant if any worthy poet be find among they he be accept by their governor with great honour and liberality neither will any man easy believe what wit and decency be in their verse their woman according to the guise of that country go very gorgeous attire they wear linen gown die black with exceed wide sleeve over which sometime they cast a mantle of the same colour or of blue the corner of which mantle be very artificial fasten about their shoulder with a fine silver clasp likewise they have ring hang at their ear which for the most part be make of silver they wear many ring also upon their finger moreover they usual wear about their thigh and ankle certain scarf and ring after the fashion of the african they cover their face with certain mask have only two hole for their eye to peep out at if any man chance to meet with they they present hide their face pass by he with silence except it be some of their ally or kinsfolk for unto they they always discover their face neither be there any use of the say mask so long as they be in presence these arabian when they travel any journey as they oftentimes do they set their woman upon certain saddle make handsome of wicker for the same purpose and fasten to their camel back neither be they any thing too wide but fit only for a woman to sit in when they go to the war each man carry his wife with he to the end that she may cheer up her good man and give he encouragement their damsel which be unmarried do usual paint their face breast arm hand and finger with a kind of counterfeit colour which be account a most decent custom among they but this fashion be first bring in by those arabian which before we call african what time they begin first of all to inhabit that region for before then they never use any false or gloze colour the woman of Barbary use not this fond kind of paint but content themselves only with their natural hue they regard not such feign ornament howbeit sometime they will temper a certain colour with hens-dung and safron wherewithal they paint a little round spot on the ball of their cheek about the breadth of a french crown likewise between their kickshaw they make a triangle and paint upon their chin a patch like unto a olive leaf some of they also do paint their kickshaw and this custom be very high esteem of by the arabian poet and by the gentleman of that country howbeit they will not use these fantastical ornament above two or three day together all which time they will not be see to any of their friend except it be to their husband and child for these paint seem to be great allurement unto lust whereby the say woman think themselves more trim and beautiful how the arabian in the desert between Barbary and Egypt do lead their life the life of these man be full of misery and calamity for the place where they inhabit be barren and unpleasant they have some store of camel and other cattle howbeit their fodder be so scarce that they can well sustain they neither shall you find over all the whole region any place fit to bear corn and if in that desert there be any village at all which use to husband and manure their ground yet reap they small commodity thereby except it be for plentiful increase of date their camel and other of their cattle they exchange for date and corn and so the poor husbandman of the foresay village have some small recompense for their labour notwithstanding how can all this satisfy the hunger of such a multitude for you shall daily see in Sicilia great number of the arabian of barca lay their son to pawn unto the sicilian for corn their son lay to pawn because when they have not wherewithal to pay for the corn which they there buy they be constrain to leave their son behind they as pledge of future payment but the sicilian if their money be not pay they at the time appoint will challenge the arabian son to be their slave which day be once past if any father will redeem his child he must disburse thrice or four time so much as the due debt amount unto for which cause they be the most notable thief in the whole world if any strange fall into their hand deprive he of all that he have they present carry he to Sicily and there either sell or exchange he for come and I think that no merchant (@) at any time within these hundred year (@) for traffic sake upon any part of their coast for when they be to pass by with merchandise or about any other weighty affair they eschew that region five hundred mile at the least once I remember that I myself for my better (@) and to avoid the danger of those mischievous people go in company with certain merchant who in three ship sail along their coast we be no soon espy of they but forthwith they come run to the shore make sign that they will traffic with we to our great advantage howbeit we dare not repose any trust in they none of our company will depart the ship before they have deliver certain pledge unto we which be do we buy certain (@) or geld man and good store of butter of they and so immediate weigh our anchor we betake we to flight fear lest we shall have be meet withal by the sicilian and rhodian pirate and be spoil not only of our good but of our liberty also to be short the say arabian be very rude forlorn beggarly lean and hunger-starved people have God no doubt (@) displease against they by who vengeance they daily sustain such (@) calamity of the people call Soara namely which possess drove and flock of cattle and be african by birth do notwithstanding imitate the manner of the arabian you shall find many among the african which live shepherd or drover life inhabit upon the begin of mount Atlas and be disperse here and there over the same mountain they be constrain always to pay tribute either to the king of the same region where they dwell or else to the arabian except those only which inhabit Temesna who be free from all foreign superiority and be of great power they speak the same kind of language that other africane do except some few of they which converse with the inhabitant of the city call which be near unto Tunis who speak the arabian tongue moreover there be a certain people inhabit that region which divide Numidia from Tunis these oftentimes wage war against the king of Tunis himself which they put in practice not many year since when as the say king his son march towards they from Constantina with a army for the demand of such tribute as be due unto he fight a very unfortunate battle for no soon be they advertise of the king son the (@) and death of the ring of Tunis his son his approach but forthwith they go to meet he with two thousand horseman and at length vanquish and slay he at unaware carry home with they all the furniture bag and baggage which he have bring forth and this be do in the year of mahumets Hegeira 915. from that time their fame have be spread abroad in all place yea many of the king of Tunis his subject revolt from their king unto they insomuch that the prince of this people be grow so puissant that scarce be his equal to be find in all Africa of the faith and religion of the ancient african or moor the ancient african be much addict to idolatry even as certain of the persian be at this day some of who worship the sun and other the fire for their god for the say african have in time past magnificent and most stately temple build and dedicate as well to the honour of the sun as of the fire in these temple day and night they keep fire kindle give diligent heed that it may not at any time be extinguish even as we read of the roman vestal virgin all which you may read more full and at large in the persian and african chronicle those african which inhabit Libya and Numidia will each of they worship some certain planet unto who likewise they offer sacrifice and prayer some other of the land of Negro worship Guighimo that be to say the lord of heaven and this sound point of religion be not deliver unto they by any prophet or teacher but be inspire as it be from God himself after that they embrace the jewish law wherein they be say to have continue many year afterwards they profess the christian religion and continue christian until such time as the mahometan superstition prevail which come to pass in the year of the Hegeira 208. about which time certain of Mahomet disciple so bewitch they with eloquent and deceivable speech that they allure their weak mind to consent unto their opinion insomuch that all the kingdom of the negro adjoin unto Libya receive the mahometan law neither be there any region in all the negro land which have in it at this day any christian at all at the same time such as be find to be jew christian or of the african religion be slay every man of they howbeit those which dwell near unto the ocean sea be all of they very gross idolater between who and the portugal there have be from time to time and even at this present be great traffic and familiarity the inhabitant of Barbary continue for many year idolater but before the come of Mahomet above 250 year they be say to have embrace the christian faith which some think come to pass upon this occasion namely because that of part Barbary which contain the kingdom of Tripoli and Tunis be in time past govern by apulian and sicilian captain and the country of * * * trenizen Caesaria and of * * * * * Maroco and Fez Mauritania be suppose to have be (@) unto the goth at what time also many christian flee from the fury and madness of the goth leave their sweet native soil of Italy and at length arrive in Africa near unto Tunis where have settle their abode for some certain space they begin at length to have the dominion over all that region howbeit the christian which inhabit Barbaria not respect the rite and ceremony of the church of Rome follow the arrian (@) and form of live and one of the african christian be that most godly and learned father saint Augustine when the arabian therefore come to conquer that part of Africa they find christian to be lord over the region adjacent of who after sundry hot conflict the say arabian get the victory whereupon the arrian be deprive of all their dominion and good go part of they into Italy and part into Spain and so about two hundred year after the death of Mahumet almost all Barbary be infect with his law howbeit afterward civil dissension arise among they neglect the law of Mahumet they slay all the priest and governor of that region which tumult when it come to the ear of the mahometan Caliphas they send a huge army against the say rebel of Barbary to wit those which be revolt from the Calipha of Bagdet and severe punish their misdemeanour and even at the same time be lay the most (@) foundation of the mahometan law notwithstanding there have remain many heresy among they even until this very day as touch the patron of the mahometan law and likewise concern the difference in religion between the mahometan a book write by John Leo concern the mahometan religion of Africa and they of Asia we will by God grace write more in another several volume and in the mean season let these particular which we have note suffice the reader of the letter and character of the african those writer which record the history of the arabian do be all joint of opinion that the african be wont to use only the latin letter and they do most constant affirm the african use in time past none other kind of letter but the roman letter that the arabian when they first (@) Africa and especial Barbary which be the principal seat of the african find no letter nor character there beside the latin neither indeed do they deny that the african have a peculiar kind of language but this they firm avouch that they have the very same letter which the (@) or Florentinesa people of Italy have the arabian have no history * * * * * * * * * * * * * perhaps he mean the history of Sallust (@) Livius and other of african matter which be not first write in latin they have certain ancient author who write partly in the time of the arrian and partly before their time the name of all which be clean forget howbeit it be very likely that those latin author have write many volume for when their interpreter labour to persuade something unto we I remember they will say it be contain in the 70 book neither do they in translate of the say volume altogether follow the author order but take the history of some one prince they will conjoin his time and action with the history of the persian assyrian and chaldaean king or of the israelite which concern the same time but when as those which rebel against the Calipha of Bagdet as be aforesaid get the upper hand in Africa they burn all the african book for they be of opinion that the african so long as they have any knowledge of natural philosophy or of other good art and science will every day more and more arrogant contemn the law of Mahumet contrariwise some historiographer there be which affirm that the african have a kind of letter peculiar unto themselves which notwithstanding from the time wherein the italian begin first to inhabit Barbary and wherein the christian (@) out of Italy from the goth begin to subdue those province of Africa be utter abolish and take away for it be likely that a people vanquish shall follow the custom and the letter also of their conqueror and do not the same thing happen to the persian while the arabian empire stand for certain it be that the persian at the same time lose those letter which be peculiar unto their nation and that all their book by the commandment the mahometan Calisas cause all the book of the persian to be burn of the mahometan prelate be burn lest their knowledge in natural philosophy or their idolatrous religion may move they to contemn the precept of Mahumet the like also as we show before befall the barbarian when as the italian and the goth usurp their dominion in Barbary which may here I hope suffice the gentle reader howbeit this be out of doubt that all the (@) city and inland-city of Barbary do use latin letter only whensoever they will commit any epitaph or any other verse or prose unto posterity the consideration of all which former particular have make i to be of opinion that the african in time past have their own proper and peculiar letter wherein they describe their do and exploit for it be likely that the roman when they first subdue those province as conqueror usual do utter spoil and take away all their letter and memory and establish their own letter in the stead thereof to the end that the fame and honour of the roman people may there only be continue and who know not that the very same attempt be practise by the goth upon the stately building of the roman and by the arabian against the monument of the persian the very same thing likewise we daily see put in practice by the turk who when they have get any city or town from the christian do present cast forth of the temple all the image and memorial of their saint and to omit all the aforesaid may we not in our time see the like daily practise in Rome where sumptuous and stately building leave unperfect by reason of the untimely death of one pope be for some novelty utter ruin and destroy by his next successor or else do not the new pope cause his predecessor arm to be raze and his own in stead thereof to be set up or at the least if he will not seem so arrogant let his predecessor monument stand still do he not erect other for himself far more sumptuous and stately no marvel therefore though so long success of time and so many alteration have quite bereave the african of their letter concern those nine hundred year wherein the african use the letter of the arabian Rachich a most diligent writer of Africa do in his chronicle most large dispute whether the african ever have any peculiar kind of writing or no. and at last he conclude the affirmative part that they have for say he whosoever deny this may as well deny that they have a language peculiar unto themselves for it can be that any people shall have a proper kind of speech and yet shall use letter borrow from other nation and be altogether unfit for their mother-language of the situation of Africa as there be four part in Africa so the situation thereof be not in all place alike that part which lie towards the Mediterran sea that be to say from the streite of Gibraltar to the frontier of Egypt be here and there full of mountain southward it be extend about a hundred mile albeit in some place it be large and in some other narrow from the say mountain unto mount Atlas there be a very spacious plain and many little hillock fountain there be in this region great store which meet together at one head do send forth most beautiful river and crystal stream between the foresay mountain and the plain country be situate the mountain of Atlas which begin westward upon the ocean sea stretch itself towards the east as far as the border of Egypt over against Atlas lie that region of Numidia which bear date be every where almost sandy ground between Numidia and the land of Negro be the sandy desert of Libya situate which contain many mountain also howbeit merchant travel not that way when as they may go other way with more ease and less danger beyond the libyan desert begin the land of negro all place whereof be barren and sandy except those which adjoin upon the river of Niger or through the which any river or stream run of the unpleasant and snowy place in Africa all the region of Barbary and the mountain contain therein be subject more to cold then to heat for seldom come any gale of wind which bring not some snow therewith in all the say mountain there grow abundance of fruit but not so great plenty of corn the inhabitant of these mountain live for the great part of the year upon barley bread the spring and river issue forth of the say mountain represent the quality and taste of their native soil be somewhat muddy and impure especial upon the confine of Mauritania these mountain likewise be replenish with wood and lofty (@) and be great store with beast of all kind but the little hill and valley lie between the foresay mountain and mount Atlas be far more commodious and abound with corn for ' they be moisten with river spring out of Atlas and from thence hold on their course to the Mediterran sea and albeit wood be somewhat more scarce upon these plain yet be they much more fruitful then be the plain country situate between Atlas and the ocean sea as namely the region of Maroco of Duccala of tedle of Temesna of Azgara and the country lie towards the strait of Gibraltar the mountain the mountain of Atlas exceed cold of Atlas be exceed cold and barren and bring forth but small store of corn be woody on all side and engender almost all the river of Africa the fountain of Atlas be even in the midst of summer extreme cold so that if a man dip his hand therein for any long space he be in great danger of lose the same howbeit the say mountain be not so cold in all place for some part thereof be of such mild temperature that they may be right commodious inhabit yea and sundry place thereof be well store with inhabitant as in the second part of this present discourse we will declare more at large those place which be destitute of inhabitant be either extreme cold as namely the same which lie over against Mauritania or very rough and unpleasant to wit those which be direct opposite to the region of Temesna where notwithstanding in summer time they may feed their great and small cattle but not in winter by any mean for then the north wind so furious rage bring with it such abundance of snow that all the cattle which till then remain upon the say mountain and a great part of the people also be force to lose their life in regard thereof wherefore whosoever have any occasion to travel that way in winter time choose rather to take his journey between Mauritania and Numidia those merchant which bring date out of Numidia for the use and service of other nation set forth usual upon their journey about the end of October and yet they be oftentimes so oppress most wonder and terrible snow and overtake with a sudden fall of snow that scarce one man among they all escape the danger of the tempest for when it begin to snow over night before the next morning not only cart and man but even the very tree be so drown and overwhelm therein that it be not possible to find any mention of they howbeit the dead carcase be then find when the sun have melt the snow I myself also by the goodness of the extreme danger of snow which John Leo himself escape almighty God twice escape the most dreadful danger of the foresay snow whereof if it may not be tedious to the reader I will here in few word make relation upon a certain day of the foresay month of October travel with a great company of merchant towards Atlas we be there about the sun go down weather-beaten with a most cold and snowy kind of hail here we find eleven or twelve horseman arabian to our think who persuade we to leave our cart and to go with they promise we a good and secure place to lodge in for i own part that I may not seem altogether uncivil I think it not meet to refuse their good offer albeit I stand in doubt lest they go about to practice some mischief wherefore I bethink myself to hide up a certain sum of gold which I have as then about i but all be ready to ride I have no leisure to hide away my coin from they whereupon I feign that I will go ease myself and so depart a while their company and get i under a certain tree whereof I take diligent notice I bury my money between certain stone and the root of the say tree and then we ride on quiet till about midnight what time one of they think that he have stay long enough for his prey begin to utter that in word which secret he have conceive in his mind for he ask whether I have any money about i or no to who I answer that I have leave my money behind with one of they which attend the cart and that I have then none at all about i howbeit they be no whit satisfy with this answer command i for all the cold weather to strip myself out of my apparel at length when they can find no money at all they say in jest and scoff wise that they do this for no other purpose but only to see how strong and hardy I be and how I can endure the cold and tempestuous season well on we ride seek our way as well as we can that dark and dismal night and anon we hear the bleat of sheep conjecture thereby that we be not far distant from some habitation of people wherefore out of hand we direct our course thitherwards be constrain to lead our horse through thick wood and over steep and craggy rock to the great hazard and peril of our life and at length after many labour we find shepherd in a certain cave who have with much pain bring their cattle in there have kindle a lusty fire for themselves which they be constrain by reason of the extreme cold daily to sit by who understand our company to be arabian fear at the first that we will do they some mischief but afterward be persuade that we be drive thither by extremity of cold and be more secure of we they give we most friendly entertainment for they set bread flesh and cheese before we wherewith have end our supper we lay we along each man to sleep before the fire all of we be as yet exceed cold but especial myself who before with great horror and tremble be strip stark naked and so we continue with the say shepherd for the space of two day all which time we can not set forth by reason of continual snow but the three day so soon as they see it leave snow with great labour they begin to remove that snow which lie before the door of their cave which do they bring we to our horse which we find well provide of hay in another cave be all mount the shepherd accompany we some part of our way show we where the snow be of least depth and yet even there it touch our horse belly this day be so clear that the sun take away all the cold of the two day go before at length enter into a certain village near unto Fez we understand that our cart which pass by be overwhelm with the snow then the arabian see no hope of recompense for all the pain they have take for they have defend our cart from thief carry a certain jew of our company with they as their captive who have lose a great quantity of date by reason of the snow aforesaid to the end that he may remain as their prisoner till he have satisfy for all the residue from myself they take my horse and commit i unto the wide world and to fortune from whence ride upon a mule within three day I arrive at Fez where I hear doleful news of our merchant and ware that they be cast away in the snow yea they think that I have be destrose with the rest but it seem that God will have it otherwise now have finish the history of my own misfortune let we return unto that discourse where we leave beyond Atlas there be certain hot and dry place moisten with very few river but those which flow out of Atlas itself some of which river run into the libyan desert be dry up with the sand but other do engender lake neither shall you find in these country any place apt to bring forth corn notwithstanding they have date in abundance there be also certain other tree bear fruit but in so small quantity that no increase nor gain be to be reap by they you may see likewise in those part of Numidia which border upon Libya certain barren hill destitute of tree upon the low part whereof grow nothing but unprofitable thorn and shrub among these mountain you shall find no river nor spring nor yet any water at all except it be in certain pit and well almost unknown unto the inhabitant of that region moreover in six or seven day journey they have not one drop of water but such as be bring unto they by certain merchant upon camel back and that especial in those place which lie upon the main road from Fez to Tombuto or from tremizen to * * * Agadez Agad that journey likewise be very dangerous which be of late find out by the merchant of our day from Fez to alcair over the desert of Libya be it not for a huge lake in the way upon the bank whereof the Sinites and the goranite do inhabit but in the way which lead from Fez to Tombuto be certain pit environ either with the hide or bone of camel neither do the merchant in summer time pass that way without great danger of their life for oftentimes it fall out when the south wind blow that all those pit be stop up with sand and so the merchant when they can find neither those pit nor any mention thereof must needs perish for extreme thirst who carcase be afterward find lie scatter here and there and scorch with the heat of the sun one remedy they have a strange remedy use by the african merchant to quench their thirst in this case which be very strange for when they be so grievous oppress with thirst they kill forthwith some one of their camel out of who bowel they wring and express some quantity of water which water they they drink and carry about with they till they have either find some pit of water or till they pine away for thirst in the desert which they call azaoad there be as yet extant two monument build of marble upon which marble be a Epitaphe engrave signify that one of the say monument represent a most rich merchant and the other a carrier or transporter of ware which wealthy merchant buy of the carrier a cup of water for ten a merchant constrain by extreme thirst give ten thousand ducat for a cup of water thousand ducat and yet this precious water can suffice neither of they for both be consume with thirst this desert likewise contain sundry kind of beast which in the four part of this discourse concern Libya and in our treatise of the beast of Africa we will discourse of more at large I be determine to have write more concern those thing which happen unto myself and the rest of my company travel through the libyan desert unto Gualata for sometime be sore a thirst we can not find one drop of water partly because our guide stray out of the direct course and partly because our enemy have cut off the spring and channel of the foresay pit and well insomuch that the small quantity of water which we find be spare to be keep for that which will scarce suffice we for five day we be constrain to keep for ten but if I shall commit to write all thing worthy of memory a whole year be not sufficient for i the land of Negro be extreme hot have some store of moisture also by reason of the river of Niger run through the midst thereof all place adjoin upon Niger do mighty abound both with cattle and corn no tree I see there but only certain great one bear a kind of bitter fruit like unto a chestnut which in their language be call goron the fruit call goron (@) onion likewise in the same region grow cucumber onion and such kind of herb and fruit in great abundance there be no mountain at all either in Libya or in the land of negro howbeit diverse fen and lake there be which as man report the inundation of Niger have leave behind it neither be the wood of the say region altogether destitute of elephant and other strange beast whereof we will make relation in their due place what natural impression and motion the air of Africa be subject unto and what effect ensue thereupon throughout the great part of Barbary stormy and cold weather begin common about the midst of October but in December and januarie the cold grow somewhat more sharp in all place howbeit this happen in the morning only but so gentle and remisse that no man care great to warm himself by the fire February somewhat mitigate the cold of winter but that so inconstant that the weather change sometime five and sometime six time in one day in march the north and west wind usual blow which cause the tree to be adorn with blossom in April all fruit attain to their proper form and shape insomuch that cherry be common ripe about the end of April and the beginning of mayin the midst of may they gather their fig and in mid-Iune their grape be ripe in many place likewise their pear their sweet quince and their damascen attain unto sufficient ripeness in the month of june and julie their fig of autumn may be gather in August howbeit they never have so great plenty of fig and peach as in September by the midst of August they usual begin to dry their grape in the sun where of they make reisin which if they can finish in September by reason of unseasonable weather of their grape as then ungathered they use to make wine and must especial in the province of Rifa as we will in due place signify more at large in the midst of October they take in their honey and gather their pomegranate and quince in the olive of Africa November they gather their olive not climb up with ladder nor pluck they with their hand according to the custom of Europe for the tree of Mauritania and Caesarea be so tall that no ladder be long ynongh to reach unto the fruit and therefore their olive be full ripe they climb the tree beat they off the bough with certain long pole albeit they know this kind of beat to be most hurtful unto the say tree sometime they have great plenty of olive in Africa and sometime as great scarcity certain great olive-tree there be the olive whereof be eat ripe by the inhabitant because they be not so fit for oil no year fall out to be so unseasonable but that they have three month in the spring always temperate they begin their spring upon the fifteen day of February account the eighteen of May for the end thereof all which time they have most pleasant weather but if from the five and twenty of raine signify plenty or (@) April to the five of may they have no rain fall they take it as a sign of ill luck and the rainwater which fall all the time aforesaid they call naisan that be water bless of God some store it up in vessel most religious keep it as a holy thing their summer last till the sixteen of August all which time they have most hot and clear weather except perhaps some shower of rain fall in july and August which do so infect the air that great plague and most pestilent fever ensue thereupon with which plague whosoever be infect most hardly escape death their autumn they reckon from the 17. of August to the 16. of November have common in the month of August and September not such extreme heat as before howbeit all the time between the 15. of August and the 15. of September be call by they the furnace of the whole year for that it bring fig quince and such kind of fruit to their full maturity from the 15. of November they begin their winter-season continue the same till the 14. day of February so soon as winter come they begin to till their ground which lie in the plain but upon the mountain they go to plough in October the african be most certain persuade that every year contain forty extreme hot day begin upon the 12. of june and again so many day extreme cold begin from the 12. of December their be upon the 16. of march and the 16. of September for their they account the 16. of june and the 16. of December these rule they do most strict observe as well in husbandry and navigation as in search out the house and true place of the planet and these instruction with other such like they teach their young child first of all many countrie-people and husbandman there be in Africa the peasant and unlearned people of Africa cunning in astrology who know as they say never a letter of the book will notwithstanding most learned dispute of astrology and allege most profound reason and argument for themselves but whatsoever skill they have in the art of astrology they first learn the same of the latin yea they give those very name unto their month which the latin do moreover they have extant among they a certain great book divide into three volume which they call the treasury or storehouse of husbandry this book be then translate out of latin into their tongue when Mansor be lord of Granada in the say treasury be all thing contain which may seem in any wise to concern husbandry as namely the change and variety of time the manner of sow with a number of such like particular which I think at this day the latin tongue itself whereout these thing be first translate do not contain whatsoever either the african or the mahometan have which seem to appertain in any wise to their law or religion they make their computation thereof altogether according to the course of the moon their year be divide into 354. day for unto six month they the year of the arabian and african allot 30. day and unto the other six but 29 all which be add into one sum do produce the number aforesaid wherefore their year differ eleven day from the year of the latin they have at diverse time festival day and fast about the end of autumn for all winter and a great part of the spring they be trouble with boisterous wind with hail with terrible thunder and lightning yea than it snow much in some place of Barbary the eastern southern and southeasterne wind blow in May and june do very much hurt there for they spoil the corn and hinder the fruit from come to ripeness their corn likewise be great appair by snow especial such as fall in the daytime when it begin to flower upon the mountain of Atlas they divide the year into the year divide into two season one upon the mountaine of Atlas two part only for their winter continue from October to April and from April to October they account it summer neither be there any day throughout the whole year wherein the top of those mountain be not cover with snow in Numidia the year run away very swift for they reap their corn in May and in October they gather their date but from the midst of September they have winter till the beginning of (@) but if September fall out to be rainy they be like to lose most part of their date all the field of Numidia require water from the river but if the mountain of Atlas have no rain fall upon they the numidian river wax dry and so the field be destitute of water October be destitute of rain the husbandman have no hope to cast his seed into the ground and he despair likewise if it rain not in April but their date prosper more without rain whereof the numidian have great plenty then of corn for albeit they have some store of corn yet can it scarce suffice they for half the year howbeit if they have good increase of date they can want abundance of corn which be sell unto they by the arabian for date if in the libyan desert there fall out change of weather about the midst of October and if it continue rain there all December januarie and some part of February it be wonderful what abundance of grass and milk it bring forth then may you find diverse lake in all place and many fen throughout Libya wherefore this be the meet time for the barbarie-merchant to travel to the land of Negro here all kind of fruit grow soon ripe if they have moderate shower about the end of july moreover the land of Negro receive by rain neither any benefit nor yet any damage at all for the river Niger together with the water which fall from certain mountain do so moisten their ground that no place can be devise to be more fruitful for that which Nilus be to Egypt the same be Niger to the land of Negors for it increase like Nilus the increase of the river of Niger and Nilu from the fifteen of june the space of forty day after and for so many again it decrease and so at the increase of Niger when all place be overflow with water a man may in a bark pass over all the land of negro albeit not without great peril of drown as in the five part of this treatise we will declare more at large of the length and shortness of the african life all the people of Barbary by we before mention live unto 65. or 70. year of age and few or none exceed that number howbeit in the foresay mountain I see some which have live a hundred year and other which affirm themselves to be old who age be most healthful and lusty yea some you shall find here of fourscore year of age who be sufficient strong and able to exercise husbandry to dress vine and to serve in the war insomuch that young man be oftentimes inferior unto they in Numidia that be to say in the land of date they live a long time howbeit they lose their tooth very soon and their eye wax wonderful dim which infirmity be likely to be incident unto they first because they continual feed upon date the sweetness and natural quality whereof do by little and little pull out their tooth and second the dust and sand which be toss up and down the air with eastern wind enter into their eye do at last miserable weaken and spoil their eyesight the inhabitant of Libya be of a short life but those which be most strong and healthful among they live oftentimes till they come to threescore year albeit they be slender and lean of body the negro common live the short time of all the rest howbeit they be always strong and lusty have their tooth sound even till their die day yet be there no nation under heaven more prone to venery unto which vice also the libyan and numidian be to too much addict to be short the barbarian be the weak people of they all what kind of disease the african be subject unto the child and sometime the ancient woman of this region be subject unto baldness or unnatural shed of hair which disease they can hardly be cure of they be likewise oftentimes trouble with the headache which usual afflict they without any ague join therewith many of they be torment with the toothache which as some think they be the more subject unto because immediate after hot pottage they drink cold water they be oftentimes vex with extreme pain of the stomach which ignorant they call the pain of the hart they be likewise daily molest with inward gripe and infirmity over their whole body which be think to proceed of continual drink of water yea they be (@) subject unto bone-aches and gout by reason that they sit common upon the bare ground and never wear any shoe upon their foot their chief gentleman and nobleman prove gouty oftentimes with immoderate drink of wine and eat of dainty meat some with eat of olive nut and such course fare be for the most part infect with the scuruy those which be of a sanguine complexion be great trouble with the cough because that in the spring-season they sit too much upon the ground and upon friday I have no small sport and recreation to go and see they for upon this day the people flock to church in great number to hear their (@) sermon now if any one in the sermon-tile fall a sneeze all the whole multitude will sneeze with he for company and so they make such a noise that they never leave till the sermon be quite do so that a man shall reap but little knowledge by any of their sermon if any of Barbary be infect with the disease common call the french pox they die thereof for the most part and be seldom cure this disease begin with a kind of anguish and swell and at the french disease length break out into sore over the mountain of Atlas and throughout all Numidia and Libya they scarce know this disease insomuch that oftentimes the party infect travel forthwith into Numidia or the land of negro in which place the air be so temperate that only by remain there they recover their perfect health and (@) home sound into their own country which I see many do with my own eye who without the help of any physician or medicine except the foresay wholesome air be restore to their former health not so much as the name of this malady be ever know unto the african before (@) the king of Castille expel all jew out of Spain after the return of which jew when and by what mean the french (@) be bring into Africa into Africa certain unhappy and lewd people lie with their wife and so at length the disease spread from one to another over the whole region insomuch that scarce any one family be free from the same howbeit this they be most certain persuade of that the same disease come first from Spain wherefore they for want of a better name do call it the spanish pox notwithstanding at Tunis and over all Italy it be call the french disease it be so call likewise in Egypt and Syria for there it be use as a common proverb of curse the french pox take you among the hernia or the disease call (@) or the rupture barbarian the disease call in latin hernia be not so common but in Egypt the people be much trouble therewith for some of the egyptian have their cod oftentimes so swell as it be incredible to report which infirmity be think to be so common among they because they eat so much gum and salt cheese some of their child be subject unto the fall sickness but when they grow to any stature they be free from that disease this fall sickness likewise possess the woman of Barbary and of the land of negro who to excuse it say that they be take with a spirit in Barbary the plague be rife every ten fifteen or twenty year whereby great number of people be consume for they have no cure for the same but only to rub the plague-sore with certain ointment make of armenian earth in Numidia they be infect with the plague earth of (@) scarce once in a hundred year and in the land of negro they know not the name of this disease because they never be subject thereunto the commendable action and virtue of the african those arabian which inhabit in Barbary or upon the coast of the Mediterran sea be great addict unto the study of good art and science and those thing which concern their law and religion be esteem by they in the first place moreover they have be heretofore most studious of the mathematics of philosophy and of astrology but these art as it be aforesaid be four hundred year ago utter destroy and take away by the chief professor of their law the inhabitant of city do most religious observe and (@) those thing which appertain unto their religion yea they honour those doctor and priest of who they learn their law as if they be petie-god their church they frequent very diligent to the end they may repeat certain prescript and formal prayer most superstitious persuade themselves that the same day wherein they make their prayer it be not lawful for they to wash certain of their member when as at other time they will wash their whole body whereof we will by God help discourse more at large in the second book of this present treatise when we shall fall into the mention of Mahumet and of his religion moreover those which inhabit Barbary be of great cunning and dexterity for building and for mathematical invention which a man may easy conjecture by their artificial work most honest people they be and destitute of all fraud and guile not only embrace all simplicity and truth but also practise the same throughout the whole course of their life albeit certain latin author which have write of the same region be far otherwise of opinion likewise they be most strong and valiant people especial those which dwell upon the mountain the moor be a people of great fidelity they keep their covenant most faithful insomuch that they have rather die then break promise no nation in the world be so subject unto jealousy for they will rather lose their life than put up any disgrace in the behalf of their woman so desirous they be of riches and honour that therein no other people can go beyond they they travel in a manner over the whole world to exercise traffic for they be continual to be see in Egypt in AEthiopia in Arabia Persia India and Turkey and whithersoever they go they be most honourable esteem of for none of they will profess any art unless he have attain unto great exactness and perfection therein they have always be much delight with all kind of civility and modest behaviour and it be account heinous among they for any man to utter in company any bawdy or unseemly word they have always in mind this sentence of a grave author give place to thy superior if any youth in presence of his father his uncle or any other of his kindred do sing or talk aught of love matter he be deem to be worthy of grievous punishment whatsoever lad or youth there light by chance into any company which discourse of love no soon hear nor understand what their talk tend unto but immediate he withdraw himself from among they these be the thing which we think most worthy of relation as concern the civility humanity and upright deal of the barbarian let we now proceed unto the residue those arabian which dwell in tent that be to say which bring up cattle be of a more liberal and civil disposition to wit they be in their kind as devout valiant patient courteous hospital and as honest in life and conversation as any other people they be most faithful observer of their word and promise insomuch that the people which before we say to dwell in the mountain be great stir up with emulation of their virtue howbeit the say mountainer both for learning for virtue and for religion be think much inferior to the numidian albeit they have little or no knowledge at all in natural philosophy they be report likewise to be most (@) warrior to be valiant and exceed lover and practiser of all humanity also the moor and arabian inhabit Libya be somewhat civil of behaviour be plain dealer void of dissimulation favourable to stranger and lover of simplicity those which we before name white or tawny moor be most steadfast in friendship as likewise they indifferent and favourable esteem of other nation and whole endeavour themselves in this one thing namely that they may lead a most pleasant and jocund life moreover they maintain most learned professor of liberal art and such man as be most devout in their religion neither be there any people in all Africa that lead a more happy and honourable life what vice the foresay african be subject unto never be there any people or nation so perfect endue with virtue but that they have their contrary fault and blemish now therefore let we consider whether the vice of the african do surpass their virtue and good part those which we name the inhabitant of the city of Barbary be somewhat needy and covetous be also very proud and high-minded and wonderful addict unto wrath insomuch that according to the proverb they will deep engrave in marble any injury be it never so small and will in no wise blot it out of their remembrance so rustical they be and void of good manner that scarce can any stranger obtain their familiarity and friendship their wit be but mean and they be so credulous that they will believe matter impossible which be tell they so ignorant be they of natural philosophy that they imagine all the effect and operation of nature to be extraordinary and divine they observe no certain order of live nor of law abound exceed with choler they speak always with a angry and loud voice neither shall you walk in the daytime in any of their street but you shall see common two or three of they together by the ear by nature they be a vile and base people be no better account of by their governor then if they be dog they have neither judge nor lawyer by who wisdom and counsel they ought to be direct they be utter unskilful in trade of merchandise be destitute of banker and money-changer wherefore a merchant can do nothing among they in his absence but be himself constrain to go in person whithersoever his ware be carry no people under heaven be more addict unto covetise then this nation neither be there I think to be find among they one of a hundred who for courtesy humanity or devotions sake will vouchsafe any entertainment upon a stranger mindful they have always be of injury but most forgetful of benefit their mind be perpetual possess with vexation and strife so that they will seldom or never show themselves tractable to any man the cause whereof be suppose to be for that they be so greedy addict unto their filthy lucre that they never can attain unto any kind of civility or good behaviour the shepherd of that region live a miserable toilsome wretched and beggarly life they be a rude people and as a man may say bear and breed to theft deceit and brutish manner their young man may go a woo to diverse maid till such time as they have speed of a wife yea the father of the maid most friendly welcome her suitor so that I think scarce any noble or gentleman among they can choose a virgin for his spouse albeit so soon as any woman be marry she be quite forsake of all her suitor who then seek out other new paramour for their like concern their religion the great part of these people be neither mahometan jew nor christian and hardly shall you find so much as a spark of piety in any of they they have no church at all nor any kind of prayer but be utter estrange from all godly devotion they lead a savage and beastly life and if any man chance to be of a better disposition because they have no lawgiver nor teacher among they he be constrain to follow the example of other man life and manner all the numidian being most ignorant of natural domestical and commonwealth-matter be principal addict unto treason treachery murder theft and robbery this nation because it be most slavish will right glad accept of any service among the barbarian be it never so vile or contemptible for some will take upon they to be dung-farmer other to be scullion some other to be ostler and such like servile occupation likewise the inhabitant of Libya live a brutish kind of life who neglect all kind of good art and science do whole apply their mind unto theft and violence never as yet have they any religion any law or any good form of live but always have and ever will have a most miserable and distress life there can any treachery or villainy be invent so damnable which for Lucre sake they dare not attempt they spend all their day either in most lewd practice or in hunt or else in warfare neither wear they any shoe nor garment the negro likewise lead a beastly kind of life be utter destitute of the use of reason of dexterity of wit and of all art yea they so behave themselves as if they have continual live in a forest among wild beast they have great swarm of harlot among they whereupon a man may easy conjecture their manner of live except (@) conversation perhaps be somewhat more tolerable who dwell in the (@) (@) and city for it be like that they be somewhat more addict to (@) neither be I ignorant how much my own credit be (@) when the author of this work his apology for the former relation I myself write so homely of Africa unto which country (@) (@) debt both for my birth and also for the best part of my education howbeit in this regard I seek not to excuse myself but only to appeal unto the duty of a historiographer who be to set down the plain truth in all place and be blame-woorthie for flatter or favour of any person and this be the cause that have move i to describe all thing so plain without gloss or dissimulation wherefore here I be to request the gentle reader friendly to accept of this my most true discourse albeit not adorn with fine word and artificial eloquence as of certain unknown strange matter wherein how indifferent and sincere I have show myself it may in few word appear by that which follow it be report of a lewd countryman of we that be convict of some heinous crime he be adjudge to be severe beat for it howbeit the day follow when the (@) come to do his business the malefactor remember that certain year before he have some acquaintance and familiarity with he which make he to presume that he shall find more favour at his hand than a mere stranger but he be foul (@) for the executioner use he no better then if he have never know he wherefore this caitiff at the first exclaim upon his executioner oh say he my goodfriend what make you so stern as not to acknowledge our old acquaintance hereupon the executioner beat he more cruel than before friend quoth he in such business as this I use to be mindful of my duty and to show no favour at all and so continual lay on he cease not till the judicial sentence be fulfil it be doubtless a great argument of impartial deal when as respect of former friendship can take no place wherefore I think good to record all the particular aforesaid lest that describe vice only I shall seem to flatter they with who I be now present conversant or extol only the virtue of the african I may hereafter be say to sue for their favour which I have of purpose eschew to the end that I may have more free access unto they moreover may it please you for this purpose to hear another resemblance or similitude there be upon a time a most wily bird so endue by nature that she can live as well with the fish of the sea as with the fowl of the air wherefore she be right call this bird be summon before the king of bird to pay her yearly tribute determine forthwith to change her element and to delude the king and so fly out of the air she drench herself in the ocean sea which strange accident the fish wonder at come flock about salute she and ask she the cause of her come good fish quoth the bird know you not that all thing be turn so upside down that we wot not how to live secure in the air our tyrannical king what fury haunt he I know not command i to be (@) (@) to death whereas no silly bird respect ever his commodity as (@) (@) one which most unjust edict I no soon hear of but present (@) fish I come to you for refuge wherefore vouchsafe i I beseech (@) some odd corner or other to hide my head in and then I may just say that I have find more friendship among stranger then ever I do in my own native country with this speech the fish be so persuade that stay a whole year among they not pay one penny or halfpenny at the year end the king of fish begin to demand his tribute insomuch that at last the bird be (@) to pay great reason it be say the bird that each man shall have his due and for my part I be content to do the duty of a loyal subject these word be no soon speak but she sudden spread her wing and up she mount into the air and so this bird to avoid yearly exaction and tribute will eftsoon change her element out of this fable I will infer no other moral but that all man do most affect that place where they find least damage and inconvenience for i own part when I hear the african evil speak of I will affirm myself to be one of Granada and when I perceive the nation of Granada to be discommend then will I profess myself to be a african but herein the african shall be the more behold unto i for that I will only record their principal and notorious vice omit their small and more tolerable fault JOHN LEO his second book of the history of Africa and of the memorable thing contain therein have in my first book make mention of the city bound division and some other notable and memorable thing contain in Africa we will in this second part more full particular large and distinct describe sundry province town mountain situation of place law rite and custom of people insomuch that we will leave nothing untouched which may any way serve to the illustrate and perfect of this our present discourse begin therefore at the west part of Africa we will in this our geographical history proceed eastward till we come to the border of Egypt and all this our narration follow we will divide into seven book whereunto God will we purpose to annex the eight which shall entreat of river of live creature of tree of plant of fruit of shrub and of such other most delightful matter of the region of Hea lie upon the west part of Africa hea be one of the province of Maroco be bound westward and northward with the main ocean southward with the mountain of Atlas and eastward with the river which they call (@) this river spring out of the foresay mountain discharge itself at length into the river of tensift and divide Hea from the province next adjacent of the situation and description of hea. this region of Hea be a uneeven and rough soil full of rocky mountain shady wood and chrystall-streame in all place be wonderful rich and well store with inhabitant they have in the say region great abundance of goat and ass but not such plenty of sheep ox and horse all kind of fruit be very scarce among they not that the ground be uncapable of fruit but because the people be so rude and ignorant in this behalf that very few of they be skilful in plant graft or prune of tree whereof I be easy persuade for I remember that I find among some gardiner of Hea great abundance of fruit of grain they have not much plenty except it be of barley mill and panic they have great abundance of honey which they use in stead of ordinary food but the wax they cast away little regard it because they know not the value thereof likewise there be find in this region certain thorny tree bear a gross kind of fruit not unlike unto those olive which be bring unto we from Spain the say fruit they call in their language arga. of this fruit they make a kind of oil be the fruit (@) arga. of a fulsome and strong savour which they use notwithstanding for sauce and for lamp the manner of live and the food of the people of (@) this people for the most part eat barlie-bread unleavened which be like rather unto a cake then to a loaf this bread be bake in a kind of earthen baking-pan somewhat like unto that wherewith in Italy they use to cover iuncat and dainty dish neither shall you find many in Hea which eat oven-bread they use also a certain unsavoury and base kind of meat which in their language be call Elhasid and be make in manner (@) follow they cast barlie-meale into boil water continual temper and stir the same about with a stick till they perceive it be sufficient sodden then set this pap or hastie-pudding upon the table and pour in some of their countrie-oile all the whole family stand round about the platter and eat the say pap not with spoon but with their hand and finger howbeit in the spring and summer season they temper the say meal with milk and cast in butter in stead of oil and this kind of meat be not usual among they but only at supper for in winter time they break their fast with bread and honey and in summer with milk butter and bread moreover sometime they use to eat sodden flesh whereunto some add onion other bean and some other a kind of season or sauce call by they (@) with they table and tablecloth be quite out of use in stead whereof they spread a certain round mat upon the ground which serve among this rude people both for table cloth and all the apparel and custom of the foresay people of hea. the great part of they be clad in a kind of cloath-garment make of wool after the manner of a coverlet call in their language elchise and not unlike unto those coverlet or blanket which the italian lie upon their bed in these kind of mantle they wrap themselves and then be they gird with a woollen girdle not about their waste but about their hip they have also a certain piece of cloth of ten handful in length and two in breadth wherewith they use to adorn their head these kind of ornament or head-tire they die with the juice of walnut-tree-roote be so put upon their head that their crown be always bare none of they wear any cap except it be a old man or a man of learning albeit learned man be very rare among they which cap of they be double and round not much unlike to the cap of certain physician in Italy you shall seldom find any linen shirt or smock among this people and that as I suppose either because their soil will yield no flax nor hemp or else for that they have none skilful in the art of weave their seat whereon they sit be nought else but certain mat make of hair and rush for bed they use a certain kind of hairy flockbed or mattress some of which bed be ten else in length some more and some less yea some you shall find of twenty else long but none long one part of these mattress they lie upon instead of a couch and with the residue they cover their body as it be with (@) and coverlet in the springtime always they lay the hairy side next unto their body because it be somewhat warm but in sommer-time not regard that side they turn the smooth side upward and thereon they rest themselves likewise of such base and harsh stuff they make their cushion be much like unto the stuff which be bring hither out of Albania and Turkey to serve for horse-cloathe the woman of Hea go common with their face uncover use for their housewifery turn vessel and cup of wood their platter dish and other their kitchen-vessel be for the most part of earth you may easy discern which of they be marry and who be not for a unmarried man must always keep his beard shave which after he be once marry he suffer to grow at length the say region bring forth no great plenty of horse but those that it do bring forth be so nimble and full of mettle that they will climb like cat over the steep and craggy mountain these horse be always unshod and the people of this region use to till their ground with no other cattle but only with horse and ass you shall here find great store of dear of wild goat and of hare howbeit the people be no whit delight in hunt which be the cause as I think why the say beast do so multiply and it be somewhat strange that so many river run through the country they shall have such scarcity of watermil but the reason be because every household almost have a wooden mill of their own whereat their woman usual grind with their hand no good learning nor liberal art be here to be find except it be a little skill in the law which some few challenge unto themselves otherwise you shall find not so much as any shadow of virtue among they they have neither physician nor surgeon of any learning or account but if a disease or infirmity befall any of they they present fear or cauterize cauterize the sick party with red hot iron even as the italian use their horse howbeit some chirurgeon there be among they who duty and occupation consist only in circumcise of their male child they make no soap in all the country but instead thereof they use to wash with lee make of ash they be at continual war but it be civil and among themselves insomuch that they have no leisure to fight against other nation whosoever will travel into a (@) country must take either a harlot or a wife or a religious man of the contrary part to bear he company they have no regard at all of justice especial in those mountain which be destitute of governor or prince yea even the principal man of this very region of Hea which dwell within town and city dare scarce prescribe any law or good order unto the people so great be their insolency in all place the city of Hea be few in number but they have great store of village town and most strong castle whereof God will we will hereafter speak more at large of tedn one of the city of hea. the ancient city of tedn be build by the african upon a most beautiful and large plain which they environ with a lofty wall build of brick and lime likewise a certain river run forth of the city serve to fill up the wall ditch in this city be certain merchant that sell cloth wherein the people of the same place be clad here be likewise utter a kind of cloth which be bring thither out of Portugal howbeit they will admit no artificer but tailor butcher carpenter and a few goldsmiths which be jew in this city there be no inn stove nor wine-tavern so that whatsoever merchant go thither must seek out some of his acquaintance to remain withal but if he have no friend (@) acquaintance in the town than the principal inhabitant there cast lot who shall entertain the strange merchant insomuch that no stranger be he never so mean shall their manner of entertain stranger at tedn want friendly entertainment but be always sumptuous and honourable accept of but whosoever be receive as a guest must at his departure bestow some gift upon his host in token of thankfulness to the end he may be more welcome at his next return howbeit if the say stranger be no merchant he may choose what great man house he will to lodge in be bind at his departure to no recompense nor gift to be short if any beggar or poor pilgrim the same way he have some (@) provide for he in a certain hospital which be found only for the relief of poor people and be maintain at the common charge of the city in the midst of the city stand a ancient temple be most sumptuous build and of a huge bigness which be think to be found at the very same time when as the king of Maroco bare rule in those place this temple have a great cistern stand in the midst thereof and it have many priest and such kind of people which give attendance thereunto and store it with thing necessary in this city likewise be diverse other temple which (@) they be but little yet be they most clean and decent keep there be in this city about a hundred family of jew who pay no yearly tribute at all but only bestow each of they some gratuity upon this or that nobleman who they think to favour they most to the end they may enjoy their favour still and the great part of the say city be inhabit with jew these jew have certain minting-house wherein they stamp silver coin of which 170. asper as they call they do weigh one ounce be like unto the common coin of Hungary save that this Asper be square and the hungarian coin be round the inhabitant of tedn be free from all tribute and yearly taxation howbeit if any sum of money be want for the erection of a public building or for any other common use the people be forthwith assemble and each man must give according to his ability this city be leave desolate in the year 918. of the Hegeira at what time all the citizen tedne leave desolate thereof flee unto the mountain and from thence to Maroco the reason they say be because the inhabitant be inform that their next neighbour the arabian join in league with the Portugal captain who as then hold the town of Azaphi and promise to deliver tedn into the hand of the christian which thing so daunt the citizen that they present seek to save themselves by flight myself I remember see this city utter ruin and deface the wall thereof be lay even with the ground the house be destitute of inhabitant and nothing at that time to be there see but only the nest of raven and of other bird all this I see in the 920. year of the Hegeira of tecule a town of hea. upon the foot of a hill eighteen mile eastward from tedn stand a town call by the african tecule and contain about one thousand household hard by this town run a certain river on both side whereof be most pleasant garden and all kind of tree within the wall of the say town be many pit or well whereout they draw most clear and pleasant water here also be to be see a most stately and beautiful temple as likewise four hospital and a monastery of religious person the inhabitant of this town be far wealthy than they of tedn for they have a most famous port upon the ocean sea common call by merchant goz. they have likewise great abundance of corn and pulse which grow in the fruitful field adjacent these also of tecule send wax into Portugal to be sell and they be very curious in their apparel (@) and about the furniture of their (@) when I myself be at tecule I find there a certain nobleman who be the precedent or chief of their senate this nobleman duty be both to procure tribute which be yearly to be pay unto the arabian and also to make atonement and reconciliation between they when they be at odds this man have gather great riches unto himself which he employ rather to purchase friend then to fill his coffer most liberal he be unto the poor most bountiful and favourable unto all his citizen insomuch that all man do reverence and honour unto he as unto their father and best protector of who courtesy I myself also make trial and be not mean but very sumptuous entertain by he I remain with he for a certain time and read in his house diverse history of african matter this good man together with his son be slay in a skirmish against the portugal which be do according to our computation in the year of the Hegeira 923. that be to say in the year of our lord 1514. after which misfortune tecule destroy by the portugal we hear that the city be raze that the people be part of they put to flight part lead captive and the residue (@) by the enemy all which particular we have declare more at large in that book which be now late 1514. print and publish concern african affair of Hadecchis a town of hea. the city of Hadecchis be situate upon a plain stand eight mile southward of tecule it contain seven hundred family and the wall church and house throughout this whole city be all build of free stone through the midst of the town run a large and fair stream have many vine and gallery on both side thereof there be many jew artificer in this city the citizen here go somewhat decent apparel their horse be good most of they exercise merchandise also they stamp a kind of coin and they have certain yearly fair or whereunto the nation adjoin do usual resort here be to be sell great store of cattle of butter oil iron and cloth and their say mart last fifteen day their woman be very beautiful white of colour fat comely and trim but the man bear a most savage mind be so extreme possess with jealousy that whosoever they find but talk with their wife they present go about to murder they they have no judge nor learned man among they nor any which can assign unto the citizen any function and magistracy according to their worthiness so that he rule like a king that excel the residue in wealth for matter of religion they have certain mahometan priest to administer they who neither pay tribute nor yearly custom even as they who we last before mention here I be entertain by a certain courteous and liberal mind priest who be exceed delight with arabian poetry wherefore be so love entertain I read unto he a certain brief treatise as touch the same argument which he accept so kind at my hand that he will not suffer i to depart without great and bountiful reward from hence I travel unto Maroco and afterward I hear that this town also in the year of the Hegeira Hadecchis sack by the portugal 922. be sack by the portugal and that the inhabitant be all flee into the next mountain and the very same year I return home to visit my 1513. native country which be in the year of our lord 1513. of Ileusugaghen a town of hea. this town be situate upon the top of a certain high mountain which be distant eight mile to the south of Hadecchis it consist of about two hundred family and by the foot of the hill run a small river here be no garden at all nor yet any tree which bear fruit the reason whereof be as I suppose because the inhabitant be such slothful and gross people that they regard nothing but their barley and their oil they be at continual war with their next neighbour which be perform with such monstrous bloodshed and manslaughter that they deserve rather the name of beast then of man they have neither judge priest nor lawyer to prescribe any form of live among they or to govern their commonwealth wherefore justice and honesty be quite banish out of their habitation those mountain be altogether destitute of fruit howbe it they abound great with honey which serve the inhabitant both for food and for merchandise to sell in the neighbour-country and because they know not what service to put their wax unto they cast it forth together with the other excrement of honey the say town of Ileusugaghen have a very small and narrow chapel which will scarce contain a hundred person whither notwithstanding the people do so slow resort that they need not to have any great so much do they neglect religion and piety whensoever they go abroad they carry a dagger or a iavelin about with they and you shall often hear of the slaughter of some one or other of their citizen no people under heaven can be more wicked treacherous or lewd addict than this people be I remember that I myself go once thither with a Seriffo or mahometan priest who make challenge unto the government of Hea to the end that we may arbitrate certain strife and contention for it be incredible to report what cruel war partly for murder and partly for robbery be practise among they but because the Seriffo have bring no lawyer with he nor any judge to decide controversy he will needs that I shall take that office upon i immediate the townsman come flock about we one complain that his neighbour have slay eight of his kindred and family his neighbour on the contrary allege that the former have slay ten of his family wherefore according to the ancient custom he demand to have a sum of money give he for say he there be some recompense due unto i sithence ten of my people have be slay and but eight of this my neighbour whereunto the other reply that the say ten person be just slay because they go about by violence to dispossess he of a certain piece of ground which his father have leave he by inheritance but that his eight be murder only for unjust revenge against all equity and law with these and such like frivolous allegation we spend that whole day neither can we decide any one controversy about midnight we see a great throng of people meet in the marketplace who make there such a bloody and horrible conflict that the sight thereof will have affright any man be he never so hard heart wherefore the say Seriffo fear lest those lewd varlet will make some treacherous conspiracy against he and think it better to depart thence immediate then to expect the conclusion of that fray we take our journey from that place to a town call aghilinghighil of the town of teijeut in hea. moreover the tower of Teijeut stand upon a plain ten mile westward of Ileusugaghen contain about three hundred household the house and wall of this town be build of brick the townsman exercise husbandry for their ground be most fertile for barley albeit it will scarce yield any other grain they have pleasant and large garden store with vine figtree and peach-tree also they have great abundance of goat about this town be many lion whereby the townsman be not a little endamage for they pray continual upon their goat and upon other of their cattle certain of we upon time come into these part for want of a lodging be constrain to repair unto a little cottage which we escry be so old that it be in danger of fall have provide our horse of provender we stop up all the door and passage of the say cottage with thorn and wood as circumspect as possible we can these thing happen in the month of April at what time they have extreme heat in the same country wherefore we ourselves get up to the top of the house to the end that in our sleep we may be near unto the open air about midnight we espy two monstrous lion who be draw thither by the send of our horse and endeavour to break down that fence of thorn which we have make whereupon the horse be put in fear keep such a neigh and such a stir that we misdoubt least the rot cottage will have fall and least ourselves shall have become a prey unto the lion but so soon as we perceive the day begin to break we forthwith saddle our horse and hie we unto that place where we know the prince and his army lay not long after follow the destruction of this town for the great part of the townsman be slay the rest be take by the portugal and be carry Teijeut destroy by the portugal as captive into Portugal this be do in the year of the Hegeira 920 and in the year of our lord 1513. of Tesegdelt a town of hea. the town of Tesegdelt be situate upon the top of a certain high mountain and natural environ with a high rock in stead of a wall contain more than eight hundred family it be distant from teijeut southward about twelve mile and it have a river run by it the name whereof I have forget about this town of Tesegdelt be most pleasant garden and orchard replenish with all kind of tree and especial with walnut-tree the inhabitant be wealthy have great abundance of horse neither be they constrain to pay any tribute unto the arabian there be continual war between the arabian and they and that with great bloodshed and manslaughter on both part the village lie near unto Tesegdelt do usual carry all their grain thither lest they shall be deprive thereof by the enemy who make daily inroad and invasion upon they the inhabitant of the foresay town be much the courtesy of the citizen of Tesegdelt towards stranger (@) unto courtesy and civility and for liberality and bounty unto stranger they will suffer themselves to be inferior to none other at every gate of Tesegdelt stand certain watchman or warder which do most love receive all incommer inquire of they whether they have any friend and acquaintance in the town or no if they have none then be they conduct to one of the best inn of the town and have have entertainment there according to their degree and place they be friendly dismiss and whatsoever his expense come to the stranger pay nought at all but his charge be defray out of the common purse this people of Tesegdelt be subject also unto jealousy howbeit they be most faithful keeper of their promise in the very midst of the town stand a most beautiful and stately temple whereunto belong a certain number of mahometan priest and to the end that justice may be most due administer among they they have a very learned judge who decide all matter in the common wealth except criminal cause only their field where they use to sow their corn be for the great part upon the mountain unto this very town I travel with the foresay Seriffo in the (@) of the Hegeira 919. that be to say in the year of our lord 1510. a description of the city of tagtess the most ancient city of tagtess be build round and stand upon the top of a hill on the side whereof be certain wind step hew out of the hard rock it be about fourteen mile distant from Tesegdelt by the foot of the say hill run a river whereout the woman of tagtess draw their water neither have the citizen any other drink and although this river be almost six mile from tagtess yet a man will think look down from the city upon it that it be but half a mile distant the way lead unto the say river be cut out of the rock in form of a pair of stair be very narrow the citizen of tagtess be addict unto theft and robbery and be at continual war with their neighbour they have no corne-field nor any cattle but only upon the say mountain they have great store of bore but such scarcity of horse that there be not one almost to be find in the whole city the way through their region be so difficult that they will suffer none to pass by without a public testimonial while I (@) be in that country there come such a swarm of locust that they devour the great part of their corn which be as then ripe insomuch that all the upper part of the ground be cover with locust which be in the year of the Hegeira 919. that be in the year of our lord 1510. the town of Eitdevet fifteen mile southward from tagtess stand another town call Eitdevet be build upon a plain and yet upon the high ground thereof it contain to the number of seven hundred family and have in the midst thereof most clear and cool fountain this town be environ on all side with rock and mighty wood in the say town be jew of all occupation and so i there be which affirm that the first inhabitant of this town come by natural descent from king David but so soon as the mahometan religion have infect that place their own law and religion cease here be great store of most cunning lawyer which be perfect well see in the law and constitution of that nation for I remember that I myself see a very age man who can most ready repeat a whole volume write in their language call by they Elmudevuana that be to say the body of the whole law the say volume be divide into three tome wherein all difficult question be dissolve together with certain counsel or commentary of a famous author which they call (@) they have a kind of tribunal or iudgement-hall wherein all contention happen between the citizen of this place and their neighbour-city be present decide and set through neither do the say lawyer deal only in commonwealth matter but also in case pertain to religion albeit in criminal case the people do not so great credit they for indeed their learning little serve they for that purpose be among they it be my hap to sojourn in the house of a certain lawyer who be a man of great learning this lawyer to the end he may give i more solemn entertainment will needs invite diverse learned man of his own profession to bear we company at supper after supper we have many question propound and among the residue this be one namely whether any man may just sell that person for a bondflave who be nourish by any commodity of the people there be in company at the same time a certain age sire have a grave beard and a reverend countenance unto who each one of they ascribe much honour he they call in their own language Hegazzare which name when I have hear thrice or four time repeat I demand of some that be in presence what be the true signification thereof they tell i that it signify a butcher for say they as a butcher know right well the true anatomy of every part of a beast even so can this age sire most learned dissolve all difficult question and doubt of law this people lead a most miserable and distress life their food be barley bread oil arganicke and goates-flesh they know no use of any other grain but barley their woman be very beautiful and of a lovely hue their man be strong and lusty have hair grow upon their breast and be very liberal and exceed jealous of culeihat Elmuridin that be to say the rock of disciple a castle of hea. this culeihat Elmuridin be a castle build upon the top of a certain high mountain have round about it diverse other mountain of a like height which be environ with craggy rock and huge wood there be no passage unto this castle but only a certain narrow path upon one side of the mountain by the one side thereof stand a rock and upon the other side the mountain of Tesegdelt be within half a mile and it be distant from Eitdevet almost eighteen mile this castle be build even in our time by a certain or renouncer of the mahometan religion call by they Homar seijef who be first a mahometan preacher unto a pestiferous mahometan preacher the people propound unto a great number of disciple and sectary who he have draw to be of his opinion certain new point of religion this fellow see that he prevail so with his disciple that they esteem he for some petie-god become of a false preacher a most cruel tyrant and his government last for twelve year he be the chief cause of the destruction and ruin of the whole province at length he be slay by his own wife because he have unlawful lie with her daughter which she have by her former husband and then be his perverse and lewd deal lay open unto all man for he be report to have be utter ignorant of the law and of all good knowledge wherefore not long after his decease all the inhabitant of the region gather their force together slay every one of his disciple and false sectary howbeit the nephew of the say be leave alive who afterward in the same castle endure a whole year siege of his adversary and repel they insomuch that they be constrain to depart yea even until this day he molest the people of Hea and those which inhabit near unto he with continual war live upon robbery and spoil for which purpose he have certain horseman which be appoint to watch and to pursue traveller sometime take cattle and sometime man captive he have likewise certain gunner who although traveller be a good distance off for the common high way stand almost a mile from the castle will put they in great fear howbeit all people do so deadly hate he that they will not suffer he to till one foot of ground or to bear any dominion without the say mountain this man have cause his grandfather body to be honourable bury in his castle suffer he to be adore of his people as if he be a god pass by that way upon a a treatise write by (@) Leo concern the mahometan religion certain time I escape their very bullet narrow the life religion and manner of the foresay Homar seijef I perfect learn by a

only about thing necessary to the end they may make their best gain and advantage thereby their ground be most fertile for barley as likewise they have great abundance of honey and of oil arganicke the passage or way unto this city be very narrow lie only upon one side of the hill and it be so hard and difficult that horse can without great labour and peril go upon it the inhabitant be most valiant people and well exercise in arm maintain continual war against the arabian and that for the most part with very prosperous success by reason of the natural and strong situation of the (@) a more liberal people than this you shall hardly find they general exercise themselves in make of earthen pot and vessel which I think none of their neighhour thereabouts can do of Tefethne a port and most famous mart-towne of hea. near unto the ocean sea stand a city most strong both for situation and building common call Tefethne be westward of ingilingigil about forty mile they say that this town be build by certain african and that it contain more than six hundred household here ship of mean burden may safe harbour themselves and hither the Portugal merchant resort to buy goats-skin and

with he that do the fact he be present without any judgement to have that be like for like inflict upon he but if he escape that he be banish seven year out of the city at the end of which seven year the malefactor have pay a certain sum of money to the friend of the wound or slay party be afterward receive into favour and account among the number of citizen all the inhabitant of Tefethne be of a most white colour be so addict unto friendship and hospitality that they favour stranger more than their own citizen they have a most stately and rich hospital howbeit those which be there place may

here thirteen day with the Seriffo his (@) chancellor who go thither of purpose to buy certain (@) for his lord in the year of the Hegeira 919. which be in the year of our lord 1510. of the mountain of Hanchisa this mountain begin westward from Atlas and from thence stretch almost forty mile eastward at the foot of this mountain stand messa with the residue of the region of sus. the inhabitant of this mountain be such valiant footman that one of they will encounter two horseman the soil will yield no corn at all but barley (@) honey there be in great abundance with snow they be almost at all time trouble but how patient and strong they can endure the cold a man may easy guess for that the whole year throughout they wear one single garment only this people my lord the Seriffo attempt often to bring under his subjection howbeit he have not as yet prevail against they of the mountain of Ilalem this mountain begin westward from the mountain aforesaid on the east it abut upon the region of Guzula and southward upon the plain of sus. the inhabitant be valiant have great store of horse they be at continual war among themselves for certain silver mine of silver mine so that those which have the better hand dig as much silver as they can and distribute to every man his portion until such time as they be restrain from dig by other the situation and estate of the region of Maroco this region begin westward from the mountain of Nefisa stretch eastward to the mountain of Hadimei and northward even to that place where the most famous river of tensift and asfinual meet together that be to say upon the east border of hea. this region be in a manner three square be a most pleasant country and abound with many drove and flock of cattle it be green every where and most fertile of all thing which serve for food or which delight the sense of smell or see it be altogether a plain country not much unlike to Lombardie the mountain in this region be most cold and barren insomuch that they will bring forth nought but barley wherefore according to our former order begin at the west part of this region we will proceed in our description eastward of Elgihumuha a town of Maroco upon that plain which be about seven mile distant from Atlas and not far from the river of Sesseva stand a town call by the inhabitant Elgihumuha which be build as they suppose by the african a while after it be bring under the subjection of certain arabian about that very time when the family of Muachidin aforesaid begin to revolt from the kingdom and at this day the ruin and relic of this town can scarce be see the arabian which now dwell thereabouts do sow so much ground only as to supply their own necessity and the residue they let lie untilled and fruitless howbeit when the country thereabouts be in flourish estate the inhabitant pay yearly unto the prince for tribute 100000. ducat and then this town contain above six thousand family travel that way I be most friendly entertain by a certain arabian and have good experience of the people liberality save that I hear of some that they be most treacherous and deceitful of the castle of Imegiagen the castle of Imegiagen be build upon the top of a certain hill of Atlas be so fortify by natural situation that it neither have nor need any wall it stand southward of Elgihumuha as I take it 25. mile this castle be in time pass under the jurisdiction of the noble man of that region until such time as it be take by one Homar essuef a from the mahometan religion as we will afterward declare the say Homar the (@) of Homar essuef use such monstrous tyranny in that place that neither child nor woman big with child can escape his cruelty insomuch that he cause the unborn infant to be rip out of their mother womb and to be murder this be do in the year of the Hegeira 900 and so that place remain destitute of inhabitant in the year 920. of the Hegeira the say region begin to be inhabit anew howbeit now there can but one side of the mountain only be till for the plain underneath be so dangerous both by reason of the daily incursion of the arabian and also of the portugal that no man dare travel that way of the town of Tenessa upon a certain hill of Atlas name Ghedmin stand a town which be build as some report by the ancient african and call by the name of Tenessa be a most strong and defensible place and be distant about eight mile eastward from the river of asifinuall at the foot of the say hill lie a most excellent plain which be it not for the lewd (@) arabian will yield a incomparable crop and because the inhabitant of Tenessa be deprive of this (@) commodity they till only that ground which be upon the side of the mountain and which lie between the town and the river neither do they enjoy that gratis for they yearly pay unto the arabian for tribute the three part of their corn of the new town of Delgumuha upon the top of a certain high mountain be build in our time a most large and impregnable fort be environ on all side with diverse other mountain and call by the inhabitant new Delgumuha beneath the say mountain spring asifinuall which word signify in the african tongue the river of rumour because that break forth by the side of the hill with a monstrous noise it make a most deep gulf much like unto that which the italian call tivoli the say fort contain almost a thousand family it be sometime govern by a certain tyrant which come thither out of the king of Maroco his court here may you find great store of soldier both horseman and fooreman they gather yearly tribute of the people border upon Atlas to the sum of a thousand crown they have always have great league and familiarity with the arabian each of who have accustom to salute and gratify the other with mutual gift for which cause they have oftentimes much provoke the king of Maroco against they they have always be great lover of civility and have wear neat and decent apparel neither shall you find any corner in the whole town which be not well people in this town be plenty of artificer for it be but fifty mile from the city of Maroco upon the say mountain there be great store of garden and orchard which yield the inhabitant yearly they reap likewise barley hemp and cotton and their goat be almost innumerable likewise they have many priest and judge but as touch their mind they be ignorant froward and exceed addict to jealousy in this town I abode certain day with a kinsman of i who while he dwell at Fez be impoverish with extreme study of alchemy be constrain to flee unto this town where in process of time he become secretary unto the governor of the city of Imizmizi upon a certain part of Atlas stand a city call Imizmizi westward it be distant from new Delgumuha about fourteen mile and this city the arabian be report to have build near unto this city lie the common high way to Guzula over the mountain of Atlas be common call Burris that be a way strew with feather because snow fall often thereupon which a man will think rather to be feather then snow not far from this town likewise there be a very fair and large plain which extend for the space of thirty mile even to the territory of Maroco this most fertile plain yield such excellent corn as to my remembrance I never see the like save that the arabian and soldier of Maroco do so much molest the say plain country that the great part thereof be destitute of inhabitant yea I have hear of many citizen that have forsake the city itself think it better to depart then to be daily oppress with so many inconvenience they have very little money but the scarcity thereof be recompense by their abundance of good ground and their plenty of corn in the time of my abode with they I go unto a certain hermit which they call * * * * * * * * * * sidi signify a saint in the arabian tongue sidi canon which famous and worthy man give i such friendly entertainment as I can easy express of the three town of Tumelgast these three town call by the name of Tumelgast be situate upon a plain about thirty mile from Maroco and fourteen mile northward of Atlas be replenish with palmtree vine and all other tree that bear fruit their field be very large and fertile be they not continual waste by the lewd arabian so few be the inhabitant of these three town that I think there be not in all above fifteen family all which be join in affinity and kindred unto the foresay hermit for which cause they be permit to till some part of that plain without pay of any tribute unto the arabian save only that they entertain the arabian when they travel that way their lowly and base habitation a man will take rather to be hogs-cote then dwell place for man hence it be that they be so continual vex with flea gnat and other such vermin their water be exceed salt this province also I peruse in the company of my dear friend sidi (@) who go thither to gather up the tribute of the country on the behalf of the king of Portugal this sidi be appoint governor over all that circuit which be call by they Azafi of the town of Tesrast this town be situate upon the bank of the river Asifelmel it stand westward of Maroco fourteen mile and about twenty mile from Atlas round about this town they have diverse garden and enclosure abound with date and corn and the chief part of the inhabitant earn their live with garden howbeit sometime the increase of their river be so great that it drown all their garden and corne-field and they be by so much the more miserable in regard that the arabian all summertime do possess the whole region devour all thing which the poor husbandman by their great care and industry have provide with these people I make no long tarry but only till I can have well bait my horse howbeit in that short time I hardly escape with life and good from certain arabian thief a most exact description of the great and famous city of Maroco this noble city of Maroco in Africa be account to be one of the great city in the whole world it be build upon a most large field be about fourteen mile distant from Atlas one joseph the son of the first founder of Maroco Tesfin and king of the tribe or people call Luntuna be report to have be the founder of this city at that very time when he conduct his troop into the region of Maroco and settle himself not far from the common high way which stretch from agmet over the mountain of Atlas to those desert where the foresay tribe or people do usual inhabit here may you behold most stately and wonder workmanship for all their building be so cunning and artificial contrive that a man can easy describe the same this huge and mighty city at such time as it be govern by Hali the son of king joseph contain more than 100000. family Maroco in time past contain above 100000. family it have four and twenty gate belong thereto and a wall of great strength and thickness which be build of white stone and lime from this city the river of tensift lie about six mile distant here may you behold great abundance of temple of college of bathstove and of inn all frame after the fashion and custom of that region some be build by the king of the tribe of Luntuna and other by Elmunchidin his successor but the most curious and magnificent temple of all be that in the midst of the city which be build by Hali the first king of Maroco and the son of joseph aforesaid be common call the temple of Hali be joseph howbeit one Abdul-Mumen which succeed he to the end he may utter abolish the name of Hali and may make himself only famous with posterity cause this stately temple of Maroco to be raze and to be re-edify somewhat more sumptuous than before howbeit he lose not only his expense but fail of his purpose also for the common people even till this day do call the say temple by the first and ancient name likewise in this city not far from a certain rock be build a temple by he that be the second usurper over the kingdom of Maroco Mansor the king of Maroco after who death his nephew Mansor enlarge the say temple fifty cubit on all side and adorn the same with many pillar which he command to be bring out of Spain for that purpose under this temple he make a cistern or vault as big as the temple itself the roof of the say temple he cover with lead and at every corner he make leaden pipe to convey rain water into the cistern underneath the temple the turret or steeple be build of most hard and well frame stone like unto Vespasian his at Rome contain in compass more than a hundred else and in height exceed the steeple of Bononia the stair of the say turret or steeple be each of they nine handful in breadth the utmost side of the wall be ten and * * * the thickness of the turret be five the say turret have seven loft unto which the stair ascend be very lightsome for there be great store of window which to the end they may give more light be make broad within than without upon the top of this turret be build a certain spire or pinnacle rise sharp in form of a sugarloaf and contain five and twenty else in compass but in height be not much more than two spear length the say spire have three loft one above another unto every of which they ascend with wooden ladder likewise on the top of this spire stand a golden half moon upon a bar of iron with three sphere of gold under it which golden sphere be so fasten unto the say iron bar that the great be low and the least high it will make a man giddy to look down from the top of the turret for man walk on the ground be they never so tall seem no big than a child of one year old from hence likewise may you plain escry the promontory of Azaphi which notwithstanding be a hundred and thirty mile distant but mountain you will say by reason of their huge bigness may easy be see a far off howbeit from this turret a man may in clear weather most easy see fifty mile into the plain country the inner part of the say temple be not very beautiful but the roof be most cunning and artificial vault the timber be frame and set together with singular workmanship so that I have not see many fair temple in all Italy and albeit you shall hardly find any temple in the whole world great than this yet be it very mean frequent for the people do never assemble there but only upon friday yea a great part of this city especial about the foresay temple lie so desolate and void of inhabitant that a man can without great difficulty pass by reason of the ruin of many house lie in the way under the porch great store of book in old time to be sell in Maroco of this temple it be report that in old time there be almost a hundred shop of sale-booke and as many on the other side over against they but at this time I think there be not one bookseller in all the whole city to be find and scarce be the three part of this city inhabit within the wall of Maroco be vine palmtree great garden and most fruitful corne-field for without their wall they can till no ground by reason of the arabian often inroad know you this for a certainty that the say city be grow to untimely decay and old age for scarce five hundred and six year be past since the first building thereof forasmuch as the foundation thereof be lay in the time of joseph the son of Tesfin that be to say in the 424. year of the Hegeira which decay I can impute to none other cause but to the injury of continual war and to the often alteration of magistrate and of the common wealth after king joseph succeed his son Hali and the son of Hali be ordain governor after his father decease in who time spring up a factious crew by the mean of a certain mahometan preacher name Elmaheli be a man both bear and bring up in the mountain the say Elmaheli have levy a great army wage war against Abraham his sovereign Lord whereupon king Abraham conduct another army against he have marvelous ill success and after the battle end his passage into the city of Maroco be so stop and restrain that he be force with a few soldier which remain yet alive to flee eastward to the mountain of Atlas but Elmaheli not be satisfy with expel his true sovereign out of his own kingdom command one of his captain call Abdul Mumen with the one half of his army to pursue the distress king while himself with the other half lay siege to Maroco the king with his follower come at length unto oran hope there to have renew his force but Abdul Mumen and his great army pursue the say king so narrow that the citizen of oran tell he in plain term that they will not hazard themselves for he wherefore this unhappy king be utter drive to despair set his queen on horseback behind he and so in the night time ride forth of the city but perceive that he be descry and know by his enemy he flee forthwith unto a certain rock stand upon the seashore the miserable death of Abraham king of Maroco and of (@) (@) where set spur to his horse-side he cast himself his most dear spouse and his horse down headlong and be within a while after find slay among the rock and stone by certain which dwell near unto the place wherefore Abdul Mumen have get the victory return in triumphant manner towards Maroco where the foresay Elmaheli be decease before his come in who place Abdul be choose king and mahometan prelate over the forty disciple and take ten person to be of his privy council which be a new invention in the law of Mahumet this Abdul Mumen have besiege the city of Maroco for the space of a whole year at last overcome it and kill Isaac the only son of king Abraham with his own hand he command all the soldier and a good part of the citizen to be slay this man posterity reign from the five hundred sixteen to the six hundred sixty eight year of the Hegeira and at length they be dispossess of the kingdom by a certain king of the tribe call marin now attend I beseech you and mark what change and alteration of estate befall afterward the family of marin after the say king decease bare rule till the year of the Hegeira 785. at length the kingdom of Maroco decrease daily more and more be govern by king which come out of the next mountain howbeit never have Maroco any governor which do so tyrannize over it as they of the family call (@) the principal court of this family be hold for the most part at Fez but over Maroco be appoint viceroy and deputy insomuch that Fez be continual the head and metropolitan city of all Mauritania and of all the western dominion even as God will we will declare more at large in our brief treatise concern the law and religion of Mahumet but now have make a sufficient digression let we resume the matter subject where we leave in the say city of Maroco be a most impregnable castle which if you consider the bigness the wall the tower and the gate build all of perfect marble you may well think to be a city rather than a castle within this castle there be a stately temple (@) a most (@) and high steeple on the top where of stand a half moon (@) under the half moon be three golden sphere one big than another which all of they together weigh 130000. ducat some king there three golden sphere be who be allure with the value go about to take down the say golden sphere but they have always some great misfortune or other which hinder their attempt insomuch that the common people think it very dangerous if a man do but offer to touch the say sphere with his hand some affirm that they be there place by so forcible a influence of the planet that they can be remove from thence by any cunning or (@) some other report that a certain spirit be adjure by (@) magic to defend those sphere from all assault and injury whatsoever in our time the king of Maroco neglect the vulgar opinion will have take down the say sphere to use they for treasure against the portugal who as then prepare themselves to battle against he howbeit his counselor will not suffer he so to do for that they esteem they as the principal monument of all Maroco I remember that I read in a certain historiographer that the wife of king Mansor to the end she may be famous in time to come cause those three sphere to be make of the princely and precious jewel which her husband Mansor bestow upon she and to be place upon the temple which he build likewise the say castle contain a most noble college which have thirty hall belong thereunto in the a great college midst whereof be one hall of a marvelous greatness wherein public (@) be most solemn read while the study of learning flourish among they such as be admit into this college have their victual and (@) free give they of their professor some be yearly allow a hundred and some two hundred ducat according to the quality of their profession neither will they admit any to hear they read but such as perfect understand what belong to those art which they profess the wall of this (@) hall be most stately adorn with paint and carve especial of (@) hall where lecture be wont public to be read all their porch and vault roof be make of paint and glitter stone call in their language (@) such as be yet use in Spain in the midst of the say building be a most pleasant and clear fountain the wall whereof be of white and polish (@) albeit low-built as in Africa for the most (@) such wall be I have hear that in old time here be great abundance of student but at my be there I find but five in all and they have now a most (@) professor and one that be quite void of all humanity in the time of my abode at Maroco I grow (@) (@) acquaintance with a certain Jew who (@) his skill in the law be but mean be (@) exceed rich and well (@) in history this Jew in regard of many singular duty which he perform to his prince find the king bounty and liberality extend unto he all other which bear any public office be in my opinion man of no high reach moreover the foresay castle as I remember have twelve court most curious and artificial build by one Mansor in the first lodge about five hundred christian which carry crossbow before the king whither soever he go not far from thence be the lodging of the lord chancellor and of the king privy counsel which house be call by they the house of affair the three be call the court of victory wherein all the armour and munition of the city be lay up the four belong to the great master of the king horse upon this court three stable adjoin each one of which stable will contain two hundred horse likewise there be two other (@) whereof one be for mule and the other for a hundred of the king horse only next unto the stable be two barn or garner adjoin in two several place in the low of which barn be lay straw and barley in the other there be also another most large place to lay up corn in every room whereof will contain more than three hundred bushel the cover of the say room have a certain hole whereunto they ascend by stair make of stone whither the beast lade with corn be come they pour the say corn into the hole and so when they will take any corn from thence they do but open certain hole below suffer so much corn to come forth as may serve their turn and that without any labour at all there be likewise a certain other hall where the king son and the son of noble man be instruct in learning then may you behold a certain fower-square building contain diverse gallery with fair glass window in which gallery be many history most curious paint here likewise the glitter and gild armour be to be see next unto this build be another wherein certain of the king guard be lodge then follow that wherein state-matter be discuss whereunto adjoin also another which be appoint for ambassador to confer with the king privy counsel in likewise the king concubine and other lady of honour have a most convenient place assign they next unto which stand the lodging of the king son not far from the castle wall on that side which be next unto the field may you behold a most pleasant and large garden contain almost all kind of tree that can be name moreover there be a sumptuous and stately porch build of most excellent square marble in the midst whereof stand a pillar with a lion very artificial make of marble out of the mouth of which lion issue most clear and crystal water fall into a cistern within the porch at each corner of the say porch stand the image of a leopard frame of excellent spot marble white marble which be natural adorn with certain black spot this kind of particoloured marble be no where to be find but only in a certain place of Atlas which be about a hundred and fifty mile distant from Maroco not far from the garden stand a certain wood or park wall round about and here I think no kind of wild beast be want for here you may behold elephant lion stags roe and such like howbeit the lion be separate in a certain place from other beast which place even to this day be call the lion den wherefore such monument of antiquity as be yet extant in Maroco albeit they be but few do not withstand sufficient argue what a noble city it be in the time of Mansor this king call Mansor be he unto who that famous (@) dedicate his book at this present all the court and lodging before describe lie utter void and desolate except perhaps some of the king ostlery which tend his mule and horse do lie in that court which we say even now be to lodge archer and crossebowe-man all the residue be leave for the fowl of the air to nestle in that garden which you may have name a paradise in old time be now become a place where the filth and dung of the whole city be cast forth where the fair and stately library be of old at this present there be nothing else to be find but hen doove and other such like fowl which build their nest there certain it be that the foresay Mansor who we have so often mention be a most puissant and mighty prince for it be well know that his dominion stretch from the town of messa to the kingdom of Tripoli in Barbary which be the most excellent region of Africa and so large that a man can hardly travel the length the huge dominion of king Mansor thereof in fourscore and ten day or the breadth in fifteen this Mansor likewise be in time past lord of all the kingdom of Granada in Spain yea his dominion in Spain extend from Tariffa to Arragon and over a great part of Castilia and of Portugal neither do this jacob surname Mansor only possess the foresay dominion but also his grandfather Abdul Mumen his father joseph and his son Mahumet Enasir who be vanquish in the kingdom of Valencia lose 60000. soldier horseman and footman howbeit himself escape and return to Maroco the christian be encourage the christian happy (@) against the moor with this victory refrain not from war till within 30. year space they have win all the town follow to wit Valencia Denia Alcauro Murcia cartagena Cordova Sivillia jaen and Vbeda after which unhappy war succeed the decay of Maroco the say Mahumet decease leave behind he ten son of a full and perfect age who contend much about the kingdom hereupon it come to pass while the brother be at discord and assail each other with mutual war that the people of Fez call marini and the inhabitant of other region adjacent begin to usurp the government the people call Habdulvad enjoy tremizen expel the king of Tunis and ordain some other who they please in his stead now have you hear the end of Mansor his progeny and successor the kingdom therefore be translate unto one jacob the son of Habdulach who be the first king of the family call marin and at length the famous city of Maroco itself by reason of the arabian continual outrage fall into most extreme calamity so great be the inconstancy of all earthly thing that which we have here report as touch Maroco partly we see with our own eye partly we read in the history of one Abdul (@) Malich a most exact chronicler of the affair of Maroco and Abdul Malich partly we borrow out of that treatise which ourselves have write concern the law of Mahumet of the town of Agmet the town of Agmet build of old by the african upon the top of a certain hill which begin almost from Atlas be distant from Maroco about four and twenty mile in time past when Muachidin be prince thereof it contain more than six

the field which lie near unto this river be say to be so fruitful that it yield every year fifty fold increase the water of this river look always white albeit if a man steadfast behold the say river it may seem unto he in colour to resemble the soil of narnia or the river Niger of Vmbria in Italy and (@) there be which ariver run under the ground to Maroco affirm that the very same river run under ground to Maroco and not to break forth of the earth till it come to a certain place very near unto the say city (@) prince in time past be desirous to know the hide and intricate passage of the say river send certain person into the hollow cave who the better to discern the same carry candle and torch with they but have proceed a little way under ground there meet they such a flaw of wind that blow out their light and perforce drive they back to the great hazard of their life so that they say they never feel the like they affirm likewise that the river be full of rock which the water drive to and fro and by reason of the manifold channel and stream their passage be altogether hinder wherefore that secret remain unknown even till this day neither be there any man so hardy as to attempt the same enterprise again I remember that I read in some history that king joseph which build Maroco be forewarn by the conjecture of a certain ginger that the whole region shall perpetual be

this river lie the common high way which cross over mount Atlas to Guzula aregion the desolation of Agmet of Maroco howbeit the city of Agmet which I have now describe unto you have at this day no other inhabitant but wolf fox dear and such other wild beast except only at my be there I find a certain hermit who be attend upon by a hundred person of his own sect all of they be well-horsed and do their best endeavour to become governor and commander but their force be insufficient with this hermit I stay as I remember for the space of ten day and find one among his follower with who I have old

of Maroco by which town on the same side of Atlas lie the direct way to Fez. from the say town the river of Agmet be almost fifteen mile distant and the field lie between the say river and town be a most fruitful soil like unto the field adjoin upon the city of Agmet before mention all the region between Maroco and the the (@) of (@) foresay river be in subjection unto the governor of Maroco but from the river unto Hannimei the townsman of Hannimei bear rule this town have a famous young captain who maintain continual war against the governor of Maroco and sometime against the arabian also he have likewise a most ample dominion upon the mountain of Atlas by natural disposition he be right liberal and valiant and have scarce attain to sixteen year of age he slay his own uncle and usurp his government whereof so soon as the arabian have intelligence join three hundred christian horseman which come out of Portugal unto their great force they march on the sudden even to the very gate of the town and the foresay captain with his army contain scarce a hundred horseman with a very few footman meet the arabian and give they such a valiant onset that the great part of they be slay and the christian be so discomfit that as I suppose not one of they return home into Portugal which they say come to pass both by reason that the christian be ignorant of the place and unskilful of the african manner of warfare these thing be do in the 920. year of the Hegeira and in the year of our lord 1511. afterwards be weary by the king of Fez his war which king demand tribute of the town man of Hannimei he be slay with a bullet whereupon the town remain tributary to the king of Fez. yea the decease captain wife deliver as prisoner certain burgess of the town unto the king himself and the king so soon as he have place a lieutenant over Hannimei depart from the same town in the 921. year of the Hegeira and in the year of our lord 1512. of the mountain of Nififa have before describe all the city and town of Maroco it now remain that we brief declare the situation and quality of the mountain there wherefore we will begin with the mountain of Nififa from whence the region of Maroco itself begin westward and be thereby divide from the province of hea. the say mountain have great store of inhabitant and albeit the top thereof be continual cover with snow yet do it yearly afford marvelous increase and abundance of barley the rude people there be so destitute of all humanity and civil behaviour that they do admire not only all stranger but also do even gaze and wonder at their apparel I myself remain two day among they in which space all the people of the town come flock about i great wonder at the white garment which I wear be such as the learned man of our country be usual clad in so that every one be desirous to handle and view this garment of i in two day it be turn from white to black and become all greasy and filthy here one of the townsman be allure with the strangeness and novelty of my sword which I buy at Fez for half a ducat will never leave entreat of i till I have exchange it with he for a horse which cost as himself affirm above ten ducat the reason of which fond and childish behaviour I think to be because they never travail unto Fez nor to any other city and be they never so desirous to travail yet dare they not adventure upon the common high way in regard of the great number of robber and thief of honey goat and oil Arganick they have wonder store for in this mountain begin the say oil to be put in use of the mountain call seem at the bound of Nififa a certain other mountain call by the inhabitant seem take his original and these two mountain be separate by the river of Sefsava seem extend eastward almost 20. mile the inhabitant whereof be most base and witless people great store of spring and fountain be here to be find the snow be perpetual all good law civility and honesty be quite banish from hence except perhaps the people be move thereunto by the advice of some stranger who they find to be of a modest and sober disposition here be entertain by a certain religious man of the same place who be have in great reputation by the people I be constrain to eat of such gross meat as the say people be accustom unto to wit of barley meal mingle with water and of goats-flesh which be extreme tough and hard by reason of the stalenes and long continuance after supper we have no other bed but the bare ground to lie upon the next morning be ready to take horse and desirous to depart fifty of the people come about i lay open each man their cause and suit unto i as our people use to do before a judge unto who I answer that I have never in all my life either know or hear of the manner and custom of that region forthwith come one of the chief man among they affirm that it be their custom never to dismiss any stranger till he have both hear and thorough decide all the quarrel and controversy of the inhabitant which word he have no soon John Leo constrain to play the judge utter but immediate my horse be take from i wherefore I be constrain for nine day and so many night long to abide the penury and misery of that region moreover my trouble be the great for that in such abundance of suit and affair there be not one man present which can set down so much as a word in writing wherefore I myself be fain to play both the judge and the notary upon the eight day they all of they promise to bestow some great reward upon i wherefore the night follow seem unto i a year long for I be in good hope the next morrow to have receive a mass of gold from my client so soon as the next day begin to dawn they place i in a certain church-porch whither after a usual and short prayer end each man full reverent present his gift unto i here some offer i a cock other bring i nut and onion and some other bestow a handful of garlic upon i the principal and headman among they present i with a goat and so by reason that there be no money in all the say mountain they proffer i not one farthing for my pain wherefore all the say gift I bequeath unto my host for his worthy entertain of i and this be all the notable reward which I reap in regard of so great and intolerable pain all thing be thus dispatch they send fifty horseman to accompany and guard i from thief in that dangerous way of the mountain call Seusava this mountain of Seusava take his beginning where seem end out of which spring a certain river have one name with the say mountain from whence it proceed never be the top of this mountain see destitute of snow the inhabitant lead a brutish and savage life wage continual war with their next neighbour for which purpose they use neither sword javelin nor any other warlike instrument but only certain sling out of which they discharge stone after a strange and wonder manner their victual consist of barley honey and goates-flesh in the same mountain great multitude of jew exercise handycrafte do inhabit likewise they make soap yron-hooke and horseshoe diverse mason be here to be find also they build their wall of no other matter but only of rough stone and lime and the roof of their house they use to cover with thatch neither have they any other kind of lime or brick they have among they also abundance of learned man and of skilful lawyer who counsel they use at all time among who I find some who have heretofore be my fellow-student at Fez and for our old acquaintance sake give i most courteous entertainment and to the end I may escape the danger of thief they conduct i a good part of my way of the mountain call upon this most lofty and cold mountain there be nothing almost to be find but continual snow and wood the inhabitant wear white cap and the region in all place be full of spring and fountain out of the say mountain spring a river which in the discourse before-going we call asifinuall all over this mountain be most deep and hollow cave wherein every year for the three cold month of November januarie and February they usual winter their cattle lay up so much fodder namely hay and the leaf of certain tree as they think will suffice they most of their victual be bring unto they from the next mountain because their own soil yield no come at all only in the spring time and in summer they have good plenty of new cheese and butter their old age they bear most lusty and stout sometime at ninety and sometime at a hundred year they give attendance to their cattle all their life long neither do they at any time or seldom see any stranger they wear no shoe at all but certain sandal only to defend the sole of their foot and their leg they wrap in a certain piece of cloth or list instead of a hose to keep themselves from the injury of the snow of the mountain call (@) this high and cold mountain have very many inhabitant upon the top whereof stand a town which be call by the name of the mountain itself in this town be great store of dweller and a most stately and beautiful temple it have likewise a most pleasant and (@) river this town be adorn with the monument of * * * * or Elmaheli Elmahdi who be in time past a most learned mahometan priest and of Abdul Mumen his disciple and albeit the inhabitant be account heretic by all other mahometan yet be there no kind of learning which they will not arrogate unto themselves because perhaps they be well read in the work of Elmahdi who be notwithstanding the ringleader of all the say heretic so that if any stranger come among they they present challenge he to dispute in matter of learning in their apparel they go very ragged and beggarly by reason that they have no tailor in the whole town their commonwealth be govern after a wild and savage manner albeit they have a certain priest which use all the policy and mean he can to bring it into good order their victual be barley-bread and oil of olive likewise they have great store of nut and of pine-tree of the

pay unto the governor of this mountain great sum of money as concern religion they follow they especial which be call Carrain the top of this mountain be continual cover with snow when I first behold this mountain I think it have be cloud so great be the height thereof the side of this mountain be altogether destitute of herb and tree be in many place store with excellent white marble which the people may dig and make a good commodity thereof be they not so sluggish and so ignorant in hew and polish of the fame in this place be many pillar and arch which be most artificial and sumptuous build by those mighty prince who we have often before make mention of which pillar they will have use for the build of water-conduit have they not be hinder by the violence of war to be brief in the say mountain I see many notable thing whereof I will here make no discourse at all partly because they be out of my remembrance and partly for avoid tediousness to the reader because I have determine to pass over these small matter and to proceed unto great of the mountain call Adimmei from Hanteta begin another huge and high mountain call by the inhabitant Adimmei extend eastward to the river of Teseut upon this mountain stand that city the prince whereof as we say before be slay in battle against the king of Fez. this mountain be well store with inhabitant and abound with wood which bring forth acorn olive and quince the people here inhabit be most valiant possess beast and cattle of all sort their air be very temperate and their soil exceed fruitful spring they have great plenty and also two river issue forth of the say mountain whereof in due place we will discourse more at large wherefore have describe all the city and mountain of Maroco border southward upon Atlas let we now pass over the say mountain of Atlas and take a view of the region beyond it common call Guzzula of the region of Guzzula this region be exceed populous westward it abut upon Ilda a mountain of Sus northward it join unto Atlas and eastward it stretch unto the region of hea. it be inhabit with savage and fierce people be most needy of money and yet abound great in cattle great store of copper and iron be here dig out of mine and here be brazen (@) and copper (@) vessel make which be carry into other country to be sell and these vessel they exchange for linen and woollen cloth for horse and for other ware necessary for the say region in all this whole region there be neither town nor castle environ with wall great village they have which contain many of they more than a thousand family a piece they have neither king nor governor to prescribe any law unto they but every one be his own captain and commander whereupon they be at continual war among themselves neither have they any truce at all but three day (@) war (@) (@) only every week during which time every man may safe and free bargain with his enemy and may travel whither he list but these day of truce be past the wretched people of this region do continual commit most horrible slaughter the foresay day of truce a certain hermit appoint unto they who they honour and reverence like a god this hermit with one eye I myself see and find he to be a trusty sincere courteous and most liberal person the common attire of the people of Guzzula be a woollen jacket straight to their body and without (@) they wear crooked broad and two-edged dagger and their sword be like unto the sword of hea. once every year they have a fair of two month long all which time though the number of merchant be never so great they give free entertainment for merchant free entertainment unto all such as either bring ware with they or come thither to fetch away their ware when the time of their fair approach they forthwith make truce and each faction appoint a captain over a hundred soldier to the end they may keep themselves in safety and may defend their say fair from the invasion and injury of all lewd person if any offence be commit the captain immediate give sentence upon the guilty person and whosoever be convict of theft be forthwith slay like a brute beast and his thief carcase be throw out to be devour of dog wild beast and ravenous fowl the say fair be keep in a certain plain or valley between two hill all the ware be contain in tent and in certain cottage make of bough so that each particular kind of

head man to repose themselves in and in the say cottage or bower be merchant stranger as we note before free entertain and bourd also they have certain cater and purveyor among they which make provision of victual and take upon they the friendly and well entertain of stranger and albeit a huge deal of money be spend for this behalf yet make they a good gain thereof for thither do resort all the merchant of that region for traffic sake yea and a great number out of the land of negro who bring with they marvelous plenty of all kind of ware and although they be man of a dull and gross capacity yet be they very industrious in govern and maintain the say fair the beginning whereof be upon the birthday of that great deceiver Mahumet that be upon the twelve day of their month call Rabih which be the three Haraba of the year according to their account I myself be present at this fair in the company of my lord the (@) for the space of fifteen day in the year of the Hegeira 920. which be in the year of our lord 1511. abriefe description of the region of Duccala this region begin westward from the river of tensift northward it be bound with the ocean sea the south part thereof lie upon the river of habid and the east part abut upon the river Ommirabih it be three day journey long and about two day journey broad very populous it be the inhabitant be a rude people and most ignorant of all civility and humanity wall city it have but a few of all which we will in their due place particular discourse neither will we by God help omit any thing which may seem worthy of memory of the town of Azaphi it be build by the african and stand upon the shore of the ocean sea contain four thousand family inhabitant there be great store be for the most part very uncivil and barbarous in time pass there dwell many jew in this town which exercise diverse handicraft their soil be exceed fertile but so gross be their own unskilfulness and negligence that they know neither how to till their ground to sow their corn or to plant vineyard except perhaps some few of they who will seem to be more provident than the residue sow a quantity of potherb in their small garden after the king of Maroco give over the government of the say region the city of Azafi be usurp by certain which be say to fetch their original from Farchon howbeit in our day the say city be govern by a certain prince call this man for a greedy and ambitious desire of reign murder his own uncle after who death he govern the town for certain year he have a daughter of most excellent beauty who fall in love with a certain courtier who name be Hali be son unto one by the help of her mother and her wait maid enjoy oftentimes the company of her paramour which when her father have intelligence of he rebuke his wife threaten death unto she if she reform not the manner of her daughter howbeit afterward he dissemble his fury but the mother thorough know her husband intent tell her daughter paramour that the prince be not to be trust and therefore advise he to take heed unto himself whereupon Hali fear lest some mischief may light upon he begin to determine with himself the prince death and for the occasion of the prince of Azafilin his death his associate in this conspiracy he take a trusty friend of he who have be most familiar with he from his childhood and be captain over a certain band of footman wherefore both of they be alike mischievous bend against their prince expect nothing else but a fit place and opportunity to put their bloody determination in practice contrariwise the king seek by all mean a occasion to effect his purpose send word unto Hali upon a certain festival day that after their mahometan devotion be finish he shall come and walk with he appoint a place where he have lay a troop of man in ambush to kill Hali at his come which be do he go to church Hali suspect no harm at all tell his associate that now be the time wherein they may bring their purpose to effect and this intent of they they forthwith declare unto ten other of their adherent and to the end that the whole matter may go secure and certain forward they present assemble a great multitude of footman which they feign that they will send the next day unto Azamor that if they be constrain to fly they may have aid and succour in a readiness all their complice be arm they come to church at the very same time when as the king with all his train be enter thereinto and have place himself next unto the mahometan preacher the church be full of auditor and the king have his guard attend upon he who because they know the two foresay young gentleman to be very familiar with the king suspect none evil but suffer they to draw near unto his person wherefore one of the say young courtier as though he the prince of Azafi slay as he be hear of a mahometan sermon will have do obeizance unto the king come before he but Hali get in at his back and stab he through with a dagger and at the very same instant the other thrust he in with his sword and so this unhappy king imbrue in his own blood give up the ghost the king guard go about to apprehend the author of this fact but be overmatch by the contrary part and suspect lest the people be author of this conspiracy they seek to save themselves by flight and after they follow all the rest of the assembly till the author of the say murder be leave alone they also immediate come forth and persuade the people with many word that they have slay the king for none other cause but only in regard that he have attempt the utter overthrow both of themselves and of the whole people the citizen be to too credulous advance the two foresay conspirator to the government of the kingdom howbeit they agree not long thereabouts but the commonwealth be diverse toss hither and thither sometime incline to one and sometime to another wherefore the Portugal merchant which usual frequent that city in great number write unto their king to send forthwith a army of soldier thither for they be in good hope that he shall most easy and with small disadvantage win the say city howbeit the king be nothing move with this message of they will not send any force at all till he be more certain inform by his say merchant touch the death of the king of Azaphi and the dissension between the two new governor as also that they have make such a compact with a certain captain of the contrary faction that it be the easy matter in the world for he to conquer the town for they have build they a very strong castle upon the seashore wherein their merchandise may safe be bestow for the portugal have persuade the townsman that during the great tumult about the king death they be all of they in danger to lose both their life and good wherefore into this castle among their vessel of oil and other ware they cunning convey gun and all other kind of warlike instrument but the townsman be ignorant here of exact nothing of the portugal save only custom due for their ware now after the portugal have sufficient provide themselves of all kind of armour and warlike munition they seek by all mean a occasion to fight with the citizen at length it come to pass that a certain Portugal servant buy meat in the city do so provoke a butcher that after much quarrel they fall to blow whereupon the servant feel himself hurt thrust the butcher with his sword and lay he along upon the cold earth and then flee speedy to the castle wherein he know the merchant to be the people immediate rise up in arm and run all of they with one consent unto the castle to the end they may utter destroy it and cut the throat of all they which be therein but the gun and crossbow which be there in a readiness make such havoc among the townsman that it can be but they be great daunt at this first encounter there be a hundred and fifty citizen slay outright howbeit the residue will not therefore give over but give the castle daily assault at length the king of Portugal send aid unto his subject to wit five thousand footman two hundred horseman with a great number of gun which force when the citizen see to approach they present betake themselves to their foot and flee unto the mountain of Benimegher neither dare any man stay in the town but only he that be the author of build the castle and so it (@) win by the portugal come to pass that the Portugal force win the town without any peril or labour soon after the general of the whole army send the builder of the castle unto the king of Portugal but the king send he with a certain number of attendant back again to Azafi and appoint he governor of all the region adjacent for the Portugal king be not acquaint with their custom neither do he sufficient know how they govern their commonwealth soon after ensue the miserable desolation and ruin not only of the city but of the whole region thereabouts in this discourse we have be somewhat tedious to the end we may show of how great evil a woman may be the instrument and what intolerable mischief be breed by dissension these thing be a do as I remember John Leo ten year old at the win of (@) when myself be but ten year old and be fowerteene year of age I have some conference with the Portugal captain aforesaid this captain with a army of five hundred portugal and more than twelve thousand arabian horseman give battle to the king of Maroco conquer

thousand measure of corn so that the arabian do carry grain from thence sufficient to serve they all the year follow in the 919. year of the Hegeira the king of Fez send his brother to govern and defend the region of Duccala who come unto this town be inform that the captain of approach thither with a great army of purpose to destroy the town and to lead the people captive whereupon the king of Fez his brother send immediate unto the say town two captain with two thousand horseman and eight hundred archer but the very same time when they enter the town they meet there the Portugal soldier accompany with two thousand arabian by who be few in number they be so miserable slay that scarce twelve archer of all the eight hundred can escape with the horseman unto the next mountain howbeit afterward the arabian renew the skirmish and 150. of the Portugal horseman be slay they put the enemy to flight whereupon the king of Fez his brother pass on to Duccala require tribute of the people and promise that as long as he live he will stand between they and their enemy afterwards be vanquish he return home to Fez unto the king his brother but the inhabitant see that the king brother have receive tribute of they and have stand they in no stead they present forsake the town and flee unto the mountain of tedle for they fear least the portugal army will come upon they and exact a great

the ocean sea shore where the river of * * * * or (@) Ommirabih disemboqu be distant from Elmadina southward about thirty mile very large it be and well inhabit and contain to the number of five thousand family here do the Portugal merchant continual reside the inhabitant be very civil and decent apparel and albeit they be divide into two part yet have they continual peace among themselves pulse and corn they have great plenty though their garden and orchard bring forth nought else but figs. they have such plenty of fish that they receive yearly for they sometime six thousand and sometime seven thousand ducat and their time of fish dure from October to the end of April they use to fry fish in a certain pan with oil whereby they gather a incredible quantity of trane neither use they any other oil to put into their lamp once a year the portugal make a voyage hither and do carry away so great abundance of fish that they only do disburse the sum of ducat aforesaid hence it be that the king of Portugal be allure for gain have often send most warlike fleet to surprise this town the first whereof in regard of the general indiscretion be the great part disperse and sink upon the sea afterwards the king send another navy of two hundred sail well furnish at the very sight whereof the citizen be so discomfit that they all betake themselves to flight and the throng be so great at their entrance of the gate that more than fourscore citizen be slay therein yea a certain prince which come to aid they be for his safety constrain to let himself down by a rope on the far side of the city the inhabitant be present disperse hither and thither some flee on horseback and other on foot neither can you I know have refrain from tear have you see the weak woman the silly old man and the tender child run away barefooted and forlorn but before the christian give any assault the jew which short after compound with the win by the portugal king of Portugal to yield the city to he on condition that they shall sustain no injury with a general consent open the gate unto they and so the christian obtain the city and the people go to dwell part of they to Sala and part to Fez. neither do I think that god for any other cause bring this calamity upon they but only for the horrible vice of sodomy whereunto the great part of the citizen be so notorious addict that they can scarce see any young stripling who escape their lust of the town call Meramei this town be build by the goth upon a plain almost fourteen mile distant from Azafi and it contain to the number of four hundred family the soil thereabouts abound great with olive and corn it be govern in time pass by the prince of Azafi but afterward be surprise by the portugal and the inhabitant be all put to flight it remain well nigh one whole year destitute of people howbeit soon after make a league with the portugal each man retire unto his own home and now I think it not amiss to report as concern the mountain of Duccala those thing which may seem worthy of memory of the mountain call Benimegher BEnimegher be distant from Azafi about twelve mile contain diverse artisan of all sort every one of which have a house at Azafi this mountain be so exceed fruitful for oil and corn that a man will scarce believe it it be once in subjection unto the prince of Azafi but the inhabitant of Azafi be put to flight as have be aforesaid have no other place for their refuge but only this mountain of Benimegher afterwards they pay tribute for certain year unto the portugal but when the king of Fez come thither with his army he carry with he part of they unto Fez and the residue return to Azafi for they be determine rather to endure any injury then to submit themselves to the christian government of the green mountain this mountain be of a exceed height begin eastward from the river of Ommirabih and extend westward to the hill call in their language Hasara and it divide Duccala from some part of tedle likewise this mountain be very rough and full of wood afford great the fruit call by the italian Frutto africano store of acorn and pineapple and a certain kind of red fruit which the italian common call africano many hermit also do inhabit upon this mountain live with no other kind of victual but such as the wood yield unto they for they be above five and twenty (@) distant from all town and city here be great store of fountain and of altar build after the mahometan fashion and many ancient house also erect by the african at the foot of this mountain there be a notable lake very like unto the lake of Bolsena in the roman territory in which lake be find infinite number of fish as namely eel pickerel and of diverse other sort which to my remembrance I never see in Italy but there be no man that go about to take any fish in this lake no marvel therefore though the number be so great upon a certain time when Mahumet the king of Fez travel great plentic of fish that way towards the kingdom of Maroco he encamp his army eight day upon the side of this lake some of his company he license to fish the same among who I see certain that take off their shirt and coat sow up their sleeve and collar and put certain hoop within they to keep they from close together and so use they in steed of net wherewith notwithstanding they catch many thousand fish but other which have net indeed get more than they and all by reason that the fish as we will now declare be perforce drive into the net for king Mahumet be there accompany with fourteen thousand arabian horseman which bring a great many more camel with they and have five thousand horseman under the conduct of his brother with a huge army of fooreman cause they all at once to enter the lake insomuch that there be scarce water enough to satisfy the camel thirst wherefore it be no marvel though the fish come so fast into the net upon the bank of this lake be many tree bear leaf like unto pine-leave among the bough whereof such abundance of turtle do nestle that the inhabitant reap wonder commodity by they Mahumet have refresh himself eight day by the foresay lake be then desirous to view the green mountain aforesaid myself with a great number of courtier and learned man attend upon he so often as he see any altar he will command his army there to make a stand and low kneel on his knee will say these word follow thou know oh lord my God that I come hither for none other cause but to release the people of Duccala from the arabian and cruel christian which attempt of i if thou think to be unjust let i only feel the punishment of this offence for these my follower be guiltless and thus we range up and down the green hill one whole day but at night we return unto our tent the next day it be king mahumets pleasure to go on hunt and hawk whereupon his hound and hawk which he have in great abundance be bring forth howbeit that sport yield nought but wild goose duck turtle-dove and other fowl but the day follow the king call for his hound falcon and eagle their game be hare dear porcupike roe-deere wolf quail and starling and by reason that none have hunt or hawk there a hundred year before they have very good pastime and after we have here stay certain day the king with his army march unto the say Elmadin a town of Duccala will all his learned man and priest which he have John Leo send ambassador from the king of Fez unto Maroco bring with he to return unto Fez. but myself as ambassador and a certain number of soldier he send unto Maroco this be do in the 922. year of the Hegeira and in the

the town wall be build of most excellent marble which be call in their language Tefza and hereupon the town be so call likewise here do reside most rich merchant of all sort of Jew here be two hundred family who exercise merchandise and diverse other trade and here you shall find many outlandish merchant which buy from hence certain black mantle with hood common call Ilbernus of these there be great number both in Ilbernus Italy and Spain neither be there in Fez any kind of ware which be not here to be buy if any merchant will exchange his ware for other he may the soon be dispatch for the townsman be furnish with diverse kind of merchandise as namely with slave horse woad leather and such like whereas if the foreigner be desirous to sell their ware for ready money they shall never attain to the value of they they have golden coin without any image or superscription their apparel be decent and their woman be beautiful and of good behaviour in this town be diverse mahometan temple and many priest and judge their commonwealth be wont always to be most prosperous and well-governed but degenerate from better to worse they be afterward so turmoil with dissension and war that certain be expel hence come unto the king of Fez humble beseech he that by force he will restore they to their native country conditional that all matter well succeed on their side they shall deliver the town unto the king this condition be accept and the king have a thousand brave horseman ready to do the feat join five hundred horse and two hundred gunner on horseback unto they moreover he write unto certain arabian which be common call Zuair and have almost four thousand horeseman at command that if need so require they will come in and aid his troop over the say army the king appoint as captain one Ezzeranghi a most valiant and redoubt warrior who have pitch his tent near unto the town begin present to give the townsman a assault but when he have do his best the warlike citizen easy give he the repulse moreover the arabian call Benigeber be come with five thousand horseman to succour the town which so soon as captain Ezzeranghi be advertise of he raise his siege and go sudden to meet with the foresay arabian who after he have discomfit in three day he then safe return to lay new siege the citizen see themselves cut off from all hope of the arabian aid begin serious to treat of peace with the enemy which the easily to obtain they promise to defray all the king charge lay out in this expedition and to pay he for yearly tribute more than ten thousand ducat howbeit with this proviso that they for who cause the king have send the say army if they enter the town shall be seclude from all magistracy and government but they hear of these condition speak unto the captain in manner follow sir if it shall please you to restore we unto our former dignity and state we will procure you above a hundred thousand ducat neither be there cause why any man shall fear any injury or violence for we protest unto you that no man shall be a farthing endamage by we only we will exact at our adversary hand the revenue of our possession which they have these three year unjust detain from we the sum whereof will amount unto thirty thousand ducat all which we be most willing to bestow upon you in regard of those labour which you have undergo for our sake moreover the revenue of the whole region shall be you which will come to twenty thousand ducat and the jew tribute shall yield you ten thousand more upon these speech the captain return answer unto the citizen that his master the king of Fez have most faithful promise those which move he unto this war that he will never forsake they till they have attain their heart desire for which cause he be more willing to have they govern than the townsman which be now in possession and that for many reason wherefore say he if you be determine to yield unto the king assure yourselves that no inconvenience shall light upon you but if you will to the end remain perverse and obstinate be you assure also that the king will deal most extreme with you this message be no soon know unto the people but forthwith they begin to be distract into diverse faction some there be which stand for the king and other choose rather manful to fight it out then that the king shall be admit insomuch that the whole city resound with brawl quarrel and contention this tumult come at length by spy unto the captain ear who present cause half his force to take arm and by their mean in three hour space he win the city with little slaughter on his part for those townsman that favour the king do what they can on the inside to set open the gate and so do the assailant on the outside neither do any resist their attempt by reason of the foresay civil dissension whereupon captain Ezzeranghi enter the city cause the king colour to be advance in the marketplace and upon the wall charge his horseman to range about the city that no citizen may escape by flight and last of all make a proclamation unto all his soldier that they shall not upon pain of death offer any injury unto the townsman then he cause all the chieftain of the contrary faction to be bring prisoner unto he to who he threaten captivity and thraldom till they shall disburse so much as the king have spend in that expedition the total sum be twelve thousand ducat which the wife and kinsfolk of the captive present pay neither can they yet obtain their liberty for the exile for who cause the king have send that army demand restitution of all their good which the other have for certain year detain from they the captive therefore be commit that night and the next morning lawyer and attorney come to plead on both side before a judge and the captain howbeit after a great deal of tedious fend and prove have conclude nothing at all the captain be so weary that he leave they and go to supper afterwards he cause the captive to be bring forth wish they to pay the sum demand for say he if you come before the king of Fez he will make you to disburse more than twice the value at which word be terrify they write unto their wife if they will ever see they alive to procure they money by some mean eight day after the woman bring as many gold ring bracelet and other such jewel as be value at eight and twenty thousand ducat for they have rather bestow these for the ransom of their husband then to reveal their great wealth bring forth all their costly ornament as if their money have be quite exhaust when therefore the king and the exile be full satisfy insomuch that nothing seem now to let the say captive from liberty the captain speak unto they in this wise sir I have signify though unwilling unto my master the king all matter which have here pass between we for I dare by no mean release you till the king letter authorize i so to do howbeit I wish you to be of good cheer for sithence you have honest restore to every man his own there be no doubt but yourselves shall short be set at liberty the same night the captain a notable and effectual practice to wring more money out of the (@) purse call a friend of he who counsel he find oftentimes to take good effect and ask he by what mean he may without suspicion of guile or treachery wring any more sum of money from they whereunto his friend reply make they believe quoth he that you be will by the king letter to put they all to death howbeit that you will not for pity sake deal so extreme with innocent person but that you will send they to Fez to receive punishment or pardon at the king pleasure hereupon the king letter be counterfeit which the day follow the captain with a lamentable voice publish unto his two and forty prisoner my friend quoth he so it be that the king have receive some sinister and wrong information that you shall go about to make a conspiracy most firm enjoin i by these his letter to put each one of you to death which though it be full sore against my will yet needs I must obey my prince if I will not witting run upon my own destruction and then shed some feign tear sithence quoth he we can upon the sudden device no better course I think it most convenient to send you with a troop of horseman unto the king who wrath perhaps you may by some mean pacify whereupon the captive grow far more pensive than before recommend themselves unto God and to the captain clemency request his good will with many tear and forthwith there come one in among they who advise they to make up some round sum of money and therewithal to try if they can appease the king and seem likewise to entreat the captain that he will by his letter stand their friend to the king hereunto the captive agree with one voice promise that they will give the king a great sum of gold and will most liberal reward the captain the captain as though forsooth this condition much dislike he ask at length how much gold they mean to send the king one say that he will disburse a thousand ducat another that he will give five hundred and the three eight hundred but the captain make show that this be too little say that he be loath to make signification of so small a sum unto the king howbeit better it be for you quoth the captain to go yourselves unto the king with who perhaps you shall make a more reasonable end than you be aware of but they fear hard measure if they shall be carry unto the king be far more importunate with the captain then before that he will to his power be good unto they wherefore the captain as though at length he have be move with their vehement petition speak unto they in this wise here be of you my master two and forty noble and rich person if you will promise two thousand ducat a man I will signify on your behalf so much unto the king and so I hope to persuade he but if this condition will not please he then must I needs send you to make answer for yourselves this condition they all of they yield unto howbeit with this proviso that every man shall give proportionable to his wealth and that they may have for the payment fifteen day of far respite the twelve day follow the captain feign that he have receive letter from his king signify that the king for his sake will show the captive more favour the fifteen day he have pay unto he eighty four thousand ducat neither can he sufficient wonder how in so small a town among two and forty inhabitant only such huge sum of money can so ready be find then write he unto his king how all matter have pass demand what shall be do with the gold and so the king forthwith send two of his secretary with a hundred horseman to fetch home the say gold unto Fez. the captive be restore to their liberty present the say captain with horse slave civet and such like gift to the value of two thousand ducat give he exceed thanks for their liberty and request he to take their present in good worth for have not their treasure be quite consume they say they will have bestow far great upon he wherefore from thence forward that region be subject unto the king of Fez and to the foresay captain Ezzeranghi till he be treacherous slay by certain arabian moreover the king receive from that city even at this present twenty thousand ducat for yearly tribute I have in this narration be indeed somewhat more large than need require howbeit perhaps I do it because I myself be present in all the expedition and be a earnest mediator for the citizen release neither see I ever to my remembrance a great mass of gold than be by subtlety draw from they yea the king himself never have so much gold in his coffer at one time for albeit he receive yearly thirty thousand ducat yet never can he store himself with so much at once nor his father before he these thing be do in the year of the Hegeira 915. and in the year of our lord 1506. and here I will have the reader to consider what man industry and wit may do in get of money the king marvel much at this sum of gold but afterward he have great cause to wonder at the wealth of a certain Jew who pay more out of his own purse than all the forename captive and his riches be the cause why the king of Fez exact fifty thousand ducat from the jew for that they be say to favour his enemy I myself bear he company that go in the king name to receive the say sum of the jew of Efza a town of tedle this town stand two mile from Tefza and contain almost six hundred family be build upon a little hill at the foot of mount Atlas in this town be many moor and jew which make * * * * * * * * * or (@) be a kind of garment Bernussi the natural inhabitant be either artificer or husbandman be in subjection to the governor of Tefza their woman be excellent spinster whereby they be say to gain more than the man of the town between this town and Tefza run a certain river call by the inhabitant derne which spring forth of Atlas run through the plain of that region till at length it fall into Ommirabih on both side of this river be most beautiful and large garden replenish with all kind of fruit the townsman here be most liberal and courteous people and will permit merchant travel that way free to come into their garden and to take thence as much fruit as they will no people be slow than they for pay of debt for albeit the merchant lay down ready money to receive Bernussi within three month yet be they sometime fain to stay a whole year myself be in this town when the king army lie in tedle and then they yield themselves to the king the second time that the king general of his army come unto they they present he with fifteen horse and as many slave afterwards they give he fifteen kine in token that they be the king loyal subject of Cithiteb this town be build by the african upon a high hill almost ten mile westward of Efza well people it be with rich and noble inhabitant and because Bernussi be here make it be always frequent with * ilbernus store of merchant the top of the say high mountain be continual cover with snow the field adjoin to the town be full of vineyard and garden which bring forth fruit in such abundance that they be nought worth to be sell in the market their woman be beautiful fat and comely be adorn with much silver their eye and hair be of a brown colour the inhabitant be so stout and sullen that when the other city of tedle yield to the king they alone stand out yea they assemble under a certain captain a army of a thousand horseman wherewith they so vex the king force that he be often in danger to have lose all that which he have get afterwards the king send his brother with a new supply of man to aid his lieutenant but he also have hard success at length have maintain war for three whole year the king command a jew to poison their captain and so at last the king win this city also in the year of the Hegeira 921. of the town of Eithiad this town be build by the african upon a certain hillock of Atlas contain to the number of three hundred family it be wall only towards the mountain for that side which respect the plain be so fortify natural with rock that it seem not to need any wall from cithiteb it be about twelve mile distant the temple of this town be little but most beautiful round about which run a mote in manner of a river the inhabitant be wealthy and noble they have great store of merchant as well townsman as foreigner the jew here inhabit be partly artificer and partly merchant about this town be abundance of spring which break through the rock of the mountain do fall into a certain river under the town on both side of this river be diverse garden wonderful replenish with grape fig and walnut likewise the side of the mountain itself abound great with olive their woman be no less beautiful than civil be adorn with much silver and wear fine ring upon their finger and arm their valley be fruitful for all kind of grain but their hill be meet only for barley and for goates-pasture in my time one raoman Benguihazzan usurp this town and enjoy it to his die day myself be once entertain by a priest of this place in the year of the Hegeira 921. of seggheme a mountain of tedle albeit this mountain stand much southerly yet be it to be account one of the mountain of tedle westward it begin from the mountain of tesavon extend itself eastward to mount Magran from whence the famous river of Ommirabih be say to take his beginning the south part border upon mount deed the inhabitant be say original to be descend from the people of Zanaga they be personable cheerful valiant and warlike people their weapon be dart turkish sword and daggers they sling stone likewise with great dexterity and force they be at continual war with the inhabitant of tedle insomuch that no merchant can pass that way without public safe-conduct and without great expense of money their house be so homely build that sometime three or four room be contain in one of goat they have great abundance as likewise of mule scarce so big as ass which range so far into the forest to seek their food that they be often devour of lion they will never submit themselves to any prince for their mountain be so rough and steep that it seem almost impregnable in my time the same captain which have win the town of tedle go about to assail they in like manner which when the mountainer understand assemble a great army they shroud themselves in a certain part of the mountain near which they know their enemy will pass and so soon as they see all the enemy horseman ascend up the hill sudden rush forth they give they the onset the skirmish be not so long as bloody for the captain army be too weak for the mountainer can neither march on nor retire wherefore they be constrain to fight it out by handblowe many of they with their horse be throw headlong down the rock be miserable crush in piece the residue be either take or slay so that I think scarce one man of they escape but of all other the captive be most miserable for the mountainer themselves will not slay they but deliver they over to their wife to be torment who as if they have be she-tigres or lioness put they to a most horrible and vile death from thencefoorth they have no traffic nor familiarity with the people of tedle neither seem they great to stand in need of their friendship for they have great store of barley of cattle and of sweet fountain unless it be for that they be exclude from all trade of merchandise of the mountain call Magran somewhat beyond the foresay mountain of seggheme stand mount Magran southward it border upon the region of Farcala near unto the lybian desert westward it begin at seggheme and extend eastward to the foot of mount deed it be continual cover with snow the inhabitant have such abundance of small and great cattle that they can long remain in one place together they build their house of the bark of certain tree the roof whereof depend on slender spar fashion like unto the hoop environ the lid of such chest or trunk as the woman of Italy when they travel carry upon their mule so likewise these these people live like the tartar people transport their whole house up and down by the strength of mule till they have find a fit place of abode where so soon as they arrive they plant their say house remain there with their whole family so long as they have grass sufficient to feed their cattle howbeit all the spring time they settle themselves in one place make certain low stable or cottage and (@) they with the bough of tree which serve for their cattle to lie in a night and to the end that the cold may not pinch they overmuch they kindle certain huge fire near unto their say stable whereupon sometime the wind so violent drive the fire that unless the cattle escape by flight they be in great danger to be consume and as their house be destitute of wall so be their (@) they be continual molest and haunt with lion and wolf in their apparel and custom they whole agree with the foresay people of seggheme save that these have house of bark and wood and the other of stone I myself in the 917. year of the Hegeira be in this mountain as I travel from dara to Fez. a description of mount deed this high and cold mountain great abound with fountain and wood westward it begin at mount Magran extend thence almost as far as the mountain of adesan and southward it border upon the plain of Todga the length thereof be almost fourscore mile upon the very top of this mountain there be a city build in ancient time whereof a few ruinous monument be to be see at this present namely certain wall of white stone wherein be diverse letter and word grave which the inhabitant themselves do not understand many be of opinion that this city be build long ago by the roman howbeit I myself can never find so much affirm by any african writer nor yet the city itself mention save that (@) Essacalli in a certain story of he make mention of Tedsi which he say be near unto segelmesse and dara but he declare not whether it be build upon mount deed or no. howbeit for my own part I think it to be the very same for there be no other city in the whole region the inhabitant of deed be in very deed most base people of who the great part dwell in cave under the ground their food be barley and Elhasid that be to say barley meal sod with water and salt which we mention before in our description of Hea for here be nothing but barley to be have goat and ass they have in great abundance the cave wherein their cattle lodge be exceed full of * * * * or Salt-peter nitre so that I very think if this mountain be near unto Italy the say nitre will yearly be worth five and twenty thousand ducat but such be their negligence and unskilfulness that they be utter ignorant to what purpose nitre serve their garment be so rude that they scarce cover half their nakedness their house be very loathsome be annoy with the stink smell of their goat in all this mountain you shall find neither castle nor wall town when they build a house they pile one stone upon another without any mortar at all the roof whereof they make of certain rubbish like as they do in some place of Sisa and Fabbriano the residue as we have say do inhabit in cave neither see I ever to my remembrance great swarm of flea then among these people moreover they be treacherous and strong thief so give to steal and quarrel that for one unkind word they will not only contend but seek also the destruction one of another they have neither judge priest nor any honest governor among they no merchant resort unto they for be give to continual idleness and not exercise any trade or handiecraft they have nothing meet for merchant to buy if any merchant bring any ware into their region unless he be safe conduct by their captain he be in danger to be rob of altogether and if the ware serve not for their own necessary use they will exact one four part of they for custom their woman be most forlorn and sluttish go more beggarly apparel then the man so continual and slavish be the toil of these woman that for misery the life of ass be not comparable to they and to be brief never be I so weary of any place in all Africa as I be of this howbeit in the year of the Hegeira 918. being command by one to who I be in duty bind to travel unto segelmesse I can not choose but come this way JOHN LEO his three book of the history of Africa and of the memorable thing contain therein a most exact description of the kingdom of Fez. the kingdom of Fez begin westward at the famous river Ommirabih and extend eastward to the river Muluia northward it be enclose partly with the ocean and partly with the Mediterran sea the say kingdom of Fez be divide into seven province to wit Temesna the territory of Fez Azgar * * * elhabet Errif garet and * * * * * Chauz or Cheuz Elchauz every of which province have in old time a several governor neither indeed have the city of Fez always be the king royal seat but be build by a certain mahometan be govern by his posterity almost a hundred and fifty year after which time the family of marin get the upper hand who here settle their abode be the first that ever call Fez by the name of a kingdom the reason why they do so we will declare more at large in our small treatise concern the mahometan religion but now let we as brief as we may describe the foresay seven province of Temesna one of the province of Fez. westward it begin at the river Ommirabih and stretch to the river Buragrag eastward the south frontier thereof border upon Atlas and the north upon the ocean sea it be all over a plain country contain in length from west to east almost fourscore mile and in breadth from Atlas to the ocean sea about threescore this province have ever almost be the principal of the seven before name for it contain to the number of forty great town beside three hundred castle all which be inhabit by barbarian african in the 323. year of the Hegeira this province be by a certain heretic against the mahometan religion call chemim the son of Mennal free from pay of tribute this bad fellow persuade the people a dangerous seducer of Fez to yield no tribute nor honour unto their prince and himself he profess to be a prophet but a while after he deal not only in matter of religion but in commonwealth-affaire also at length wage war against the king of Fez who be himself then war with the people of Zenete it so befall that a league be conclude between they conditional that chemim shall enjoy Temesne and that the king shall contain himself within his signiory of Fez so that from thencefoorth neither shall molest other the say chemim govern the province of Temesne about five and thirty year and his successor enjoy it almost a hundred year after his decease but king joseph have build Maroco go about to bring this province under his subjection whereupon he send sundry mahometan doctor and priest to reclaim the governor thereof from his heresy and to persuade he if it be possible to yield unto the king by fair mean whereof the inhabitant be advertise they consult with a certain kinsman of the foresay governor in the city call to murder the king of Maroco his ambassador and so they do soon after levy a army of fifty thousand man he march towards Maroco intend to expel thence the family of Luntuna and joseph their king king joseph hear of this news be drive into wonder perplexity of mind wherefore prepare a huge and mighty army he stay not the come of his enemy but on the sudden within three day have conduct his force over the river of Ommirabih he enter Temesne when as the foresay fifty thousand man be so dismay at the king army that they all pass the river Buragrag and so flee into Fez. but the king so dispeople and waste Temesne that without all remorse he put both man woman and child to the sword this army remain in the region eight day in which space they so raze and demolish all the town the horrible desolation of Temesne and city thereof that there scarce remain any fragment of they at this time but the king of Fez on the other side hear that the people of Temesne be come into his dominion make a truce with the tribe of Zenete and bend his great army against the say Temesnites and at length have find they half famish near unto the river of buragrag he so stop their passage on all side that they be constrain to run up the craggy mountain and thicket at last be environ with the king force some of they be drown in the river other be throw down headlong from the rock and the residue be miserable slay by their enemy and for the space of ten month there be such havoc make among the temesnite that a silly remnant of they be leave alive but king joseph prince of the luntune return forthwith to Maroco for the repair of his force to the end he may bid the king of Fez a battle howbeit Temesne be bereave of her people be leave to be inhabit of wild beast neither have that province any new colony or supply of inhabitant till that about 150. year after king Mansor return from Tunis bring thence certain arabian with he unto who he give the possession of Temesne and these arabian enjoy the say province for fifty year till such time as king Mansor himself be expel out of his kingdom and then be they also expolled by the (@) and be bring unto extreme misery afterwards the king of the family of marin bestow the say province upon the people of Zenete and Haoara hence it come to pass that the say people of Zenete and Haoara be always great friend unto the marin family and be think to have defend they from the fury of the king of Maroco from which time they have peaceable enjoy Maroco and now they be grow in less than a hundred year so mighty that they stand not in fear of the king of Fez. for they be able to bring threescore thousand horseman to the field and have two hundred castle at their command myself have great familiarity and acquaintance with they and therefore I will not stick to record all memorable thing which I see among they of a town in Temesna this famous town be build by the roman upon the ocean sea shore northward of Atlas sixty eastward of azamursixtie and westward of forty mile the citizen thereof be most civil and wealthy people the field thereto adjoin be exceed fruitful for all kind of grain neither do I think that any town in all Africa be for pleasant situation comparable thereto the plain round about it except it be to the sea northward be almost fourscore mile over in old time it be fraught with stately temple rich warehouse and shop and beautiful palace which the monument as yet remain do sufficient testify they have also most large and fair garden out of which they gather great abundance of fruit especial of melon and pome-citron even at this day all which be perfect ripe by mid-Aprill so that the inhabitant usual carry their fruit unto Fez by reason that the fruit of Fez be not so soon ripe their attire be trim and decent and they have always have great traffic with the portugal and the English likewise they have many learned man among english traffic they howbeit two reason be allege of the destruction of this town first because they be too desirous of liberty and second for that they maintain certain galley or foist wherewith they daily molest the island of Cadiz and the portugal wherefore at length the king of Portugal send a strong navy of fifty sail against they the consideration whereof strike such terror into the inhabitant that take such good as they can carry foam flee to and other to Sela and so their town be destroy by the portugal leave naked to the spoil of the enemy but the general of the king fleet not know that they be flee put all his force into battell-array howbeit after a while be advertise how the matter stand he conduct his soldier into the city which in one day space they so deface burn the house and lay the wall even with the ground that until this day it have remain void of inhabitant myself be in this place I can scarce refrain from tear when I serious behold the miserable ruin of so many fair building and temple whereof some monument be as yet extant the garden albeit they bring forth some fruit yet be they more like unto wood than garden and now by reason of the king of Fez his weakness and default this place be fall into so great desolation as I utter despair that ever it will be inhabit again of the city of Mansora this town be build by Mansor the king and mahometan patriarch of Maroco upon a most pleasant field be two mile distant from the ocean sea five and twenty mile from and five and twenty from it contain in time pass almost four hundred family by this town run a certain river call by the inhabitant guir on both side whereof in time past be most beautiful garden but now there be no fruit at all to be find for upon the surprise of the inhabitant of this town flee unto fear lest they also shall have be assail by the portugal howbeit the wall of this town remain all whole save that the arabian of Temesne break it down in certain place this town also I can not but with great sorrow behold for easy it be to repair it and to furnish it with new inhabitant if but a few house be save from ruin but such be the malice of the arabian thereabouts that they will suffer no people to re-edify the same of the town of Nuchaila this little town call by the inhabitant Nuchaila be build almost in the midst of Temesne it be well people in time past and then so long as the foresay chemim and his successor bare rule there be fair yearly hold whereunto all the inhabitant of Temesne usual resort the townsman be exceed wealthy for the plain stretch almost forty mile right forth from each side of their town i red as I remember in a certain story that they have in time past such abundance of corn as they will give a camel burden thereof for a pair of shoe howbeit when king joseph of Maroco destroy all the region of Temesne this town be lay waste together with all the town and city of the same province howbeit at this day certain fragment thereof be to be see namely some part of the town-wall and one high steeple here also in the large and pleasant garden you may see many vine and tree plant which be so old and sear that they yield no fruit at all the husbandman thereabouts have finish their day work do lay up their rake and other such country tool in the say steeple suppose that by virtue of a certain holy man which lie there bury no man dare remove they out of their place I have often see this town as I travel between and Maroco of the town of this town be situate among certain hill almost fifteen mile from mount Atlas and five and twenty mile from the town last name the soil near unto it be exceed fruitful for corn not far from the wall thereof spring a certain river about which place be great store of palmtree be but low and fruitless the say river run through certain valley and rock where iron-mine be say to have be of old iron-mine which may seem probable for the earth resemble iron in colour and the water in taste here be nothing now to be see but a few relic and ruin of house and pillar overturn for this town be destroy at the same time when the whole region as be before declare be lay waste of the town of tegeget this town be build by the african upon the bank of Ommirabih near unto the high way lead from tedle to Fez. it have in time past civil and wealthy inhabitant for it stand not far from the way which pass over Atlas into the desert hither be all the neighbour-people wont to resort for to buy corn and albeit this town be raze with all the residue in the province yet be it after long time replant with inhabitant hither do all the arabian of Temesne bring their corn deliver it unto the townsman to be keep here be no shop nor artificer at all but certain smith only which make tool of husbandry and horseshooe the townsman be straight enjoin by the arabian their governor courteous to entertain all stranger travel that way merchant pay custom there for each pack of cloth to the value of a rial but for their horse and camel they give no custom at all often travel the same way the town do not great please i albeit the ground about it do plentiful abound with cattle and corn of the town call hain Elchallu this small town stand on a certain plain not far from Mansora about this town grow abundance of wild cherrie-tree and of other thorny tree bear a round fruit not much unlike to a cherry save that it be yellow it be somewhat big than a olive and the utter part thereof be nothing pleasant in taste the fen and marsh on all side of the town be full of snail and toad which toad as the inhabitant tell i be no whit venomous there be not any african historiographer which make description or mention of this town because perhaps they think it not worthy the name of a town or for that it be long since destroy neither be it as I conjecture build by the african but either by the roman or some other foreign people a description of this great and famous town be build not many year ago by Mansor the king and mahometan patriarch of Maroco upon the ocean sea shore by the east part thereof run the river Buragrag beforenamed and there discharge itself into the main sea the rock whereon this town be found stand near the mouth of the say river have the river on the one side thereof and the sea on the other in build it much resemble Maroco which Mansor will to be a pattern thereof save that it be a great deal less than Maroco some say that the reason why it be build why king Mansor build the town of upon the seashore in this place be for that king Mansor possess the kingdom of Granada and a great part of Spain beside and consider that Maroco be so far distant that if any war shall happen he can not in due time send new force against the christian determine to build some town upon the sea shore where he and his army may remain all summer time some persuade he to lie with his army at Ceuta a town upon the streite of Gibraltar but Mansor see that by reason of the barrenness of the soil he can not maintain a army royal for three or four month in the town of Ceuta he cause this town of in short space to be erect and to be exceed beautify with temple college palace shop stove hospital and other such building moreover on the south side without the wall he cause a certain high tower like the tower of Maroco to be build save that the wind stair be somewhat large insomuch that three horse abreast may well ascend up from the top whereof they may escry ship a huge way into the sea so exceed be the height thereof that I think there be no where the like building to be find and to the end that great store of artificer and merchant may hither from all place make resort he appoint that every man according to his trade and occupation shall be allow a yearly stipend whereupon it come to pass that within few month this town be better store with all kind of artificer and merchant than

whereas the portugall-king may at his own cost have send another fleet for a new supply he will by no mean join his own people and castilian together for by reason of the diversity of counsel and of

have be diminish sometime forty thousand and fifty thousand ducat and sometime more and I have red that it have be besiege for six or seven year together in my time the governor thereof the king of Fez his cousin rely upon the favour of the people rebel against his kinsman and sovereign whereupon the Fessan king with a great army besiege the town two month together and because it will not yield so waste and destroy all the country thereabouts that the governor lose by that mean five and twenty thousand ducat of yearly revenue what then shall we think of the six and seven year siege before mention at length those Mecnase reduce under (@) by the king of Fez. citizen which favour the king of Fez open the gate and stout resist the contrary faction give the king and his soldier entrance thus by their mean the king win the city carry home to Fez the rebellious governor captive who within few day escape from he this most strong and beautiful city have many fair street whereinto by

liberal and civil people but their wit be not so refine as other some of they be merchant some artificer and the residue gentleman they count it unseemly for any man to send a horselode of seed to his husbandman or farmer they be at continual jar with the citizen of Fez but whereupon this dissension of they shall arise I can well determine their gentleman wife never go forth of the door but only in the night season and then also they must be so veil and muffle that no man may see they so great be the jealousy of this people this town be so dirty in the spring-time that it will irk a man to walk the street of a town call Gemiha elchman this ancient town stand on a plain near unto certain bath be distant southward of Mecnase fifteen mile westard of Fez thirty and from Atlas about ten mile by this town lie the common high way from Fez to tedle the field of this town be possess by certain arabian and the town itself utter destroy in the war of Sahid howbeit in certain place the wall be yet remain and diverse tower and temple stand without roof of the town call Metgara this town be build by certain african in the field of Zuaga almost fifteen mile westward from Fez. without this town for two mile together be most pleasant and fruitful garden but by the cruel war of Sahid all be lay waste and the place itself remain void of inhabitaut a hundred and twenty year howbeit when part of the people of Granada come over into Africa this region begin to be inhabit anew and whereas the granatines be great merchant of silk they cause for the breed of silkworm great store of white mulberry tree to be bring hither here likewise they plant abundance of sugarcane which prosper not so well in this place as in the province of Andaluzia in time past the inhabitant of this place be very civil people but in our time they have not be so by reason that all of they exercise husbandry of the town of Banibasil this town be build by the african upon a certain small river just in the mid way between Mecnase and Fez be distant from Fez about eighteen mile westward out of their field many river take their original which field be by the arabian sow all over with barley and hemp neither indeed will the soil yield any other commodity both by reason of the barrenness and also for that it be for the most part overflow with water whatsoever commodity arise out of this place redound to the priest of the principal mahometan temple in Fez and it amount almost yearly to twenty thousand ducat here also in time past be most large pleasant and fruitful garden as appear by the monument and relic thereof howbeit they be like other place lay waste by the war of Sahid the town itself remain destitute of inhabitant a hundred and ten year but as the king of Fez return home from Duccala he command part of his people to inhabit the same albeit their incivility make they loath so to do of Fez the principal city of all Barbary and of the founder thereof FEz be build in the time of one aron a mahometan patriarch in the year of the Hegeira 185. and in the year of our lord 786. by a certain heretic against the religion of Mahumet but why it shall so be call some be of opinion because when the first foundation thereof be dig there be find some quantity of gold which mettle in the arabian language be call Fez. which etymology seem to i not improbable albeit some will have it so call from a certain river of that name but howsoever it be we leave that to be discuss by other affirm for a undoubted truth that the founder of this city be one idris be the foresay aron his near kinsman this idris ought rather to have be mahometan idris the first founder of fe patriarch because he be nephew unto Hali the cousin-german of Mahumet who marry falerna mahumets own daughter so that idris both by father and mother be of mahumets lineage but aron be nephew unto one the uncle of Mahumet be of kindred only by the father side howbeit both of they be exclude from the say patriarkship for certain cause mention in the african chronicle although aron usurp the same by deceit for Aaron uncle be a most cunning and crafty man and feign himself to bear great favour unto the family of Hali and to be most desirous that the patriarkship shall light thereon send his ambassador almost throughout the whole world whereupon the dignity be translate from vmeve to Habdulla Seffec the first patriarch which vmeve be inform of wage war against the family of Hali and so prevail that some of they he chase into Asia and some into India howbeit a ancient religious man of the same family remain still alive at Elmadina who be very old no whit regard the dignity but this ancient sire leave behind he two son who when they be come to man estate grow into so great favour with the people of Elmadin that they be chase thence by their enemy the one be take and hang and the other who name be idris escape into Mauritania this idris dwell upon mount Zaron about thirty mile from Fez govern not only the commonwealth but matter of religion also and all the region adjacent pay he tribute at length idris decease without lawful issue leave one of his maid big with child which have be turn from the goth religion to the moor be deliver of her son they call he after his father name idris this child the inhabitant choose for their prince cause he to be most careful bring up and as he grow in year to the end they may train he up in feat of chivalry they appoint one Rasid a most valiant and skilful captain to instruct he insomuch that while he be but fifteen idris his (@) valour at fifteen year of age year of age he grow famous for his valiant act and stratagem and begin wonderful to enlarge his dominion wherefore his troop and family increase every day more and more he set his mind upon building of a city and change of his habitation and so he send for cunning builder into all nation who have diligent peruse all place in the region at last make choice of that where the city of Fez now stand for here they find great store of fountain and a fair river which spring forth of a plain not far of run pleasant almost eight mile amid the little hill till at length it cast itself upon another plain southward of the place they find a wood which they know will be right commodious for the town here therefore upon the east bank of the say river they build a town contain three thousand family neither omit they ought at all which may be require in a flourish commonwealth after the decease of idris his son erect another town direct over against the foresay on the other side of the river but in process of time either town so increase that there be but a small distance between they for the governor of each labour might and main to augment their own jurisdiction a hundred and fourscore year after there fall out great dissension and civil war between these two city which by report continue a hundred year together at length joseph king of Maroco of the luntune-familie conduct a huge army against both these prince take they prisoner carry they home unto his dominion and put they to a most cruel death and he so vanquish the citizen that there be slay of they thirty thousand then determine king joseph to reduce those two town into firm unity and concord for which cause make a bridge over the river and beat down the wall of either town right against it he unite both into one

pillar of diverse colour to support they and between pillar and pillar the arch be beautiful overcast with gold azure and diverse other colour and the roof be very artificial build of wood the side of these cloister be so close that they which be without can see such as walk within the wall round about as high as a man can reach be adorn with plaister-worke of Majorica in many place you may find certain verse which declare what year the college be build in together with many epigram in the founder commendation the letter of which verse be very great and black so that they may be red a far off this college-gate be of brass most curious carve and so be the door artificial make of wood in the chapel of this college stand a certain pulpit mount nine stair high which stair be of ivory and some affirm that the king have build this college be desirous to know how much money he have spend in build it but after he have peruse a leaf or two of his account-booke find the sum of forty thousand ducat he rend it asunder and throw it into the foresay little river add this sentence out of a certain arabian writer each precious and amiable thing though it cost dear yet if it be beautiful it can choose but be good cheap neither be any thing of too high a price which please a man affection howbeit a certain treasurer of the king make a particular account of all the say expense find that this excellent building stand his master in 480000. ducat the other college of Fez be somewhat like unto this have every one reader and professor some of which read in the forenoon and some in the afternoon in time past the student of these college have their apparel and victual allow they for seven year but now they have nothing but their chamber for the war of Sahid destroy many possession whereby learning be the (@) of learning and learned man a principal cause of disorderly and base government maintain so that now the great college of all have yearly but two hundred and the second but a hundred ducat for the maintenance of their professor and this perhaps may be one reason among many why the government not only of Fez but of all the city in Africa be so base now these college be furnish with no scholar but such as be stranger and live of the citie-alme and if any citizen dwell there they be not above two or three at the most the professor be ready for his lecture some of his auditor read a text whereupon the say professor dilate and explain obscure and difficult place sometime also the scholar dispute before their professor a description of the hospital and bath in the city of Fez. many hospital there be in Fez no whit inferior either for building or beauty unto the foresay college for in they whatsoever stranger come to the city be entertain at the common charge for three day together there be likewise as fair and as stately hospital in the suburb in time past their wealth be marvelous great but in the time of sahids war the king stand in need of a great sum of money be counsel by some of his greedy courtier to sell the live of the say hospital which when the people will in no case yield unto the king orator or speaker persuade they that all those live be give by his majesty predecessor and therefore because when the war be end they shall soon recover all again that it be far better for they by that mean to pleasure their sovereign then to let his kingly estate fall into so great danger whereupon all the say live be sell the king be prevent by untimely and sudden death before he can bring his purpose to effect and so these famous hospital be deprive of all their maintenance the poor indeed and impotent people of the city be at this day relieve but no stranger be (@) save only learn man or gentleman howbeit there be another hospital for the relief of sick and disease stranger who have their diet only allow they but no physician or medicine certain woman there be which attend upon they till they recover their former health or die in this hospital likewise there be a place for frantic or distraught person where they be bind in strong iron chain whereof the part next unto their walk be strengthen with mighty beam of wood and iron the governor of these distraught person when he bring they any sustenance have a whip of purpose to chastise those that offer to bite strike or play any mad part sometime it fall out that these frantic people will call unto they such as pass by declare how unjust they be there detain and how cruel they be handle by the officer when as notwithstanding they affirm themselves to be restore unto their right mind and have thus persuade the commers-by approach near and near unto they at length they take hold with one hand on their garment and like villain with the other hand they shameful defile their face and apparel with dung and though all of they have their privy and close stool yet will they be poison in their own filth if the servant do not often wash their lodging so that their abominable and continual stink be the cause why citizen never visit they likewise this hospital have many room for the purveyor notary cook and other officer John Leo in his youth a notary of a hospital for two year together belong to the sick person who each of they have some small yearly stipend be a young man I myself be notary here for two year which office be worth three ducat a month in this city be more than a hundred bathstove very artificial and stately build which though they be not of equal bigness yet be they all of one fashion each stove have four hall without which be certain gallery in a high place with five or six stair to ascend unto they here man put off their apparel and hence they go naked into the bath in the midst they always keep a cistern full of water first therefore they that mean to bathe themselves must pass through a cold hall where they use to temper hot water and cold together than they go into a room somewhat hot where the servant cleanse and wash they and last of all they proceed into a three hothouse where they sweat as much as they think good of the say water they give unto every man two vessel only but he that will have more and will be extraordinary wash must give to the servant one Liardo at the least and to the master of the stove but two farthing the fire that heat their water be make of nought else but beast dung for which purpose many boy be set on work to run up and down to stable and thence to carry all the dung and to lay it on heap without the towne-walle which be parch in the sun for two or three month together they use for fuel likewise the woman have their stove apart from the man and yet some hothouse serve both for man and woman but at sundry time namely for man from the three to the fourteen hour of the day and the residue for woman while woman (@) bathe themselves they hang out a rope at the first entrance of the house which be a sign for man that they may then proceed no far neither may husband here be permit to speak with their own wife so great a regard they have of their honesty here man and woman both after they have do bathe use to banquet and make merry with pleasant music and sing young stripling enter the bath stark naked without any shame but man cover their privity with a linen cloth the rich sort will not enter the common bath but that which be adorn and fine set forth and which serve for nobleman and gentleman when any one be to be bathe they lay he along upon the ground anoint he with a certain ointment and with certain instrument do away his filth the rich sort have a carpet to lie on their head lie on a wooden cushion cover with the same carpet likewise here be many barber and surgeon which attend to do their office the most part of these bath pertain to the temple and college yield unto they a great sum of money for yearly rend for some give a hundred some a hundred and fifty ducat a year neither must I here omit the festival day which the servant and officer of the bathe yearly celebrate who with trumpet and pipe call their friend together go forth of the town and there gather a wild onion put it in a certain brazen vessel and cover the same with a linen cloth wet in lee afterward with a great noise of trumpet and pipe they solemn bring the say onion unto the hothouse door and there they hang it up in the little brazen vessel or laver say that this be a most happy bode or sign of good luck unto their stove howbeit I suppose it to be some such sacrifice as the ancient moor be wont in time past when they be destitute of law and civility to offer and that the same custom have remain till this very day the like be to be see even among christian who celebrate many feast whereof they can yield no reason likewise every african town have their peculiar feast which when the christian once enjoy Africa be utter abolish and do away of the inn of Fez. in this city be almost two hundred inn the great whereof be in the principal part of the city near unto the chief temple every of these inn be three story high and contain a hundred and twenty or more chamber apiece likewise each one have a fountain together with sink and water-pipe which make avoidance of all the filth never to my remembrance do I see great building except it be the spanish college at Bologna or the palace of the cardinal di San giorgio at Rome of which inn all the chamber-doore have walk or gallery before they and albeit the inn of this city be very fair and large yet they afford most beggarly entertainment to stranger for there be neither bed nor couch for a man to lie upon unless it be a course blanket and a mat and if you will have any victual you must go to the shambles yourself and buy such meat for your host to dress as your stomach stands-to in these inn certain poor widow of Fez which have neither wealth nor friend to succour they be relieve sometime one and sometime two of they together be allow a chamber for which courtesy they play both the chamberlain and cook of the inn the innkeeper of Fez be all of one family call Elcheva go apparel like woman and shave their beard and be so delight to imitate woman that they will not only counterfeit their speech but will sometime also sit down and spin each one of these have his concubine who he deny as if she be his own lawful wife albeit the say concubine be not only ill-favoured in countenance but notorious for their bad life and behaviour they buy and sell wine so free that no man control they for it none resort hither but most lewd and wicked people to the end they may more bold commit villainy the innkeeper have a consul over they and they pay tribute unto the governor of the city and when the king have occasion to send forth a army than they as be most meet for the purpose be constrain large to victual the camp have not the strait law of history enforce i to make relation of the foresay particular as they stand I will much rather have smother such matter in silence as tend so extreme to the disgrace of Fez which be reform there be not any city in all Africa for the honesty and good demeanour of the citizen comparable thereunto for the very company of these innkeeper be so odious and detestable in the sight of all honest man learned man and merchant that they will in no wise vouchsafe to speak unto they and they be firm enjoin not to enter into the temple into the burse nor into any bath neither yet be they permit to resort unto those inn which be next unto the great temple and wherein merchant be usual entertain all man in a manner be in utter detestation of these wretch but because the king army have some use of they as be aforesaid they be bear withal whether the citizen will or no. of the mill of Fez. in this city be mill in four hundred

gentleman so mean which for fine diet and stately furniture excel not the great potentate and lord of all Africa the manner of solemnize marriage as touch their marriage they observe these course follow so soon as the maid father have espouse she unto her lover they go forthwith like bride and bridegroom to church accompany with their parent and kinsfolk and call likewise two notary with they to make record before all that be present of the covenant and dowry the mean sort of people usual give for their daughter dowry thirty ducat and a woman-slave of fifteen ducat price as likewise a

whereunto for great dainty be bring a kind of bread fry and temper with honey which we have before describe then they bring roast-meat to the board all this be at the bridegroom cost afterward the bride father make a banquet in like sort who if he bestow on his daughter some apparel beside her dowry it be account a point of liberality and albeit the father promise but thirty ducat only for a dowry yet will he sometime bestow in apparel and other ornament belong to woman two hundred yea sometime three hundred ducat beside but they seldom give a house a vineyard or a field for a dowry moreover upon the bride they bestow three gown make of costly cloth and three other of silk chamlet or of some other excellent stuff they give her smock likewise curious wrought with fine veil and other embroider vesture as also pillow and cushion of the best sort and beside all the former gift they bestow eight carpet or coverlet on the bride four whereof be only for seemliness to spread upon

see what be the appurtenance of their dowry wherein some do strive so much to excel other that oftentimes many gentleman have bring themselves unto poverty thereby some italian think that the husband bestow a dowry upon his wife but they altogether mistake the matter the bridegroom be ready to carry home his bride cause she to be place in a wooden cage or cabinet eight-square cover with silk in which she be carry by porter her parent and kinsfolk follow with a great noise of trumpet pipe and drum and with a number of torch the bridegroom kinsman go before with torch and the bride kinsfolk follow after and so they go unto the great market place and have pass by the temple the bridegroom take his leave of his father in law and the rest hie he home with all speed and in his chamber expect the presence of his spouse the father brother and uncle of the bride lead she unto the chamber-door and there deliver she with one consent unto the mother of the bridegroom who as soon as she be enter touch her foot with he and forthwith they depart into a several room by themselves in the mean season the banquet be come forth and a certain woman stand before the (@) door expect till the bridegroom have deflower his bride reach she a napkin stain with blood which napkin she carry incontinent and show to the guest proclaim with a loud voice that the bride be ever till that time a unspotted and pure virgin this woman together with other woman her companion first the parent of the bridegroom and then of the bride do honourable entertain but if the bride be find not to be a virgin the marriage be make frustrate and she with great disgrace be turn home to her parent at complete marriage they make for the most part three banquet the first the same day when the bridegroom and bride be join in wedlock the second the day follow for woman only and the three seven day after whereat all the kinsfolk and friend of the bride be present and this day the bride father according to his ability send great store of dainty dish unto his son in law but so soon as the new marry man go forth of the house which be for the most part on the seven day after the marriage he buy great plenty of fish which he cause his mother or some other woman to cast upon his wife foot and this they from a ancient superstitious custom take for a good bode likewise at the bridegroom father they use to make two other feast the one upon the day before the bride be marry and so that night they spend in dance and disport the morrow after a company of woman go to dress the bride to comb her lock and to paint her cheek with vermillion her hand and her foot they die black but all this paint present lose the fresh hue and this day they have another banquet the bride they place in the high room that she may be see of all and then those that dress the bride be condign entertain be come to the bridegroom house his parent salute the new bride with certain great cup full of new wine and cake with other iuncat which we will here pass over in silence all which be bestow upon the bridegroom companion the same night which we say be spend in dance there be present at the bridall-house certain minstrel and singer which by turn sometime use their instrument and sometime voice-musicke they dance always one by one and at the end of each galliard they bestow a largesse upon the musician if any one will honour the dancer he bid he kneel down before he and have fasten piece of money all over his face the musician present take it off for their fee the woman dance alone without any man at the noise of their own musician all these thing use to be perform when the bride be a maid but the marriage of the marriage of widow widow be conclude with less ado their cheer be boil beef and mutton and stew hen with diverse iuncate dish among in stead of trencher the guest be ten or twelve in number have so many great round platter of wood set before they and this be the common custom of gentleman and merchant the mean sort present their guest with certain sop or bruesse of bread like unto a pan-cake which be dip in flesh-pottage they eat out of a great platter not with spoon but with their finger only and round about each great platter stand to the number of ten or twelve person likewise they make a solemn feast at the circumcision of their male child which be upon the seven day after their birth the circumcision of their child and at this feast the circumciser together with all their friend and kinsfolk be present which be do each one according to his ability bestow a gift upon the circumciser in manner follow every man lay his money upon a lad face which the circumciser bring with he whereupon the lad call every one by his name give they thanks in particular and then the infant be circumcise they spend that day with as great jollity as a day of marriage but at the birth of a daughter they show not so much alacrity of their rite observe upon festival date and their manner of mourn for the dead among the people of Fez there have remain certain relic (@) christian ceremony (@) among the (@) of festival day institute of old by the christian whereupon they use certain ceremony which themselves understand not upon Christmas even they eat a salad make of diverse herb they see likewise that night all kind of pulse which they feed upon for great dainty upon newyear day the child go with mask and vizard on their face to the house of gentleman and merchant and have fruit give they for sing certain carol or song when as the feast of saint John Baptist be hallow among christian you shall here see all about great store of fire make with straw and when their child tooth begin to grow they make another feast call according to the latin Dentilla they have also many other rite and custom of divine or soothsay the like whereof I have see at Rome and in other city of Italy as touch their feast prescribe by the mahometan law they be at large set down in that brief treatise which we have write concern the same law the woman have by death lose their funeral their husband father or any other of their dear friend assemble forthwith a great multitude of their own sex together who strip themselves out of their own attire put on most vile sackcloth and defile their face with much dirt then call they certain man clad in woman attire bring great fower-square drum with they at the noise of which drum the women-mourner sing a funeral song tend as much as may be to the commendation of the party decease and at the end of every verse the say woman utter most hideous shriek and outcry tear their hair and with much lamentation beat their cheek and breast till they be all-imbrued with blood and so these heathenish superstition continue for seven whole day together at which seven day end they surcease their mourn for the space of 40. day and then they begin anew to torment themselves for three day together in manner aforesaid howbeit these kind of obsequy be observe only by the base people but the gentleman and better sort behave themselves more modest at this time all the widow friend come about she to comfort she and send diverse kind of meat unto she for in the mourn house they may dress no meat at all till the dead corpse be carry forth the woman herself that lose her husband father or brother never go forth with the funeral but how they wash and bury the dead corpse and what superstition they use thereabouts you shall find record in my little treatise above mention of their dove-house diverse there be in this city that take much pleasure in keep of dove which be here in great plenty of all colour these dove they keep in certain cage or locker on the top of their house which locker they set open twice a day to wit morning and evening delight great to see they fly for those that out-flie the residue be account the best oftentimes it fall out that neighbour dove will be mingle together for which cause you shall see the owner go together by the ear some have a certain net bind unto two long cane wherewith they use to take their neighbour dove as they come fly forth of their lover among the collier you shall find seven or eight shop only of those that sell dove their manner of game at Fez. the citizen use most of all to play at chess and that from ancient time other game there be also but very rude and use only by the common people at certain time of the year the boy of one street will fight with club against the boy of another street and that sometime with so great fury that they (@) themselves to other weapon and slay one another especial upon their festival day what time they will challenge and provoke one another forth of the citie-walle and have fight hard all the whole day at night they fall to throw of stone till at length the citie-officer come upon they take some and beat they public throughout the city sometime it fall (@) that the young stripling arm themselves and go by night out of the city range up and down the field and garden and if the contrary faction of yoonker and they mere it be wonder what a bloody skirmish ensue howbeit they be often most severe punish for it of the african poet in Fez there be diverse most excellent poet which make verse in their own mother tongue most of their poem and song entreat of love every year they pen certain verse in the commendation of Mahumet especial upon his birthday for then betimes in the morning they resort unto the palace of the chief judge or governor ascend his tribunall-seate and from thence read their verse to a great audience of people and he reward for poet in Fez. who verse be most elegant and pithy be that year proclaim prince of the poet but when as the king of the marin-family prosper they use to invite all the learned man of the city unto their palace and honourable entertain they they command each man in their hear to recite their verse to the commendation of Mahumet and he that be in all man opinion esteem the best poet be reward by the king with a hundred ducat with a excellent horse with a woman-slave and with the king own robe wherewith he be then apparel all the rest have fifty ducat apiece give they so that none depart without the king liberality but a hundred and thirty year be expire since this custom together with the majesty of the Fessan kingdom decay a description of the grammar-schoole in Fez. of school in Fez for the instruct of child there be almost two hundred every one of which be in fashion like a great hall the schoolmaster teach their child to write and read not out of a book but out of a certain great table every day they expound one sentence of the Alcoran and have red quite through they begin it again repeat it so often till they have most firm commit the same to memory which they do right well in the space of 7. year then read they unto their scholar some part of orthography howbeit both this and the other part of grammar be far more exact teach in the college then in these trivial school the say schoolmaster be allow a very small stipend but when their boy have learn some part of the Alcoran they present certain gift unto their master according to each one ability afterwards so soon as any boy have perfect learn the whole Koran his father invite all his son schoolfellow unto a great banquet and his son in costly apparel ride through the street upon a gallant horse which horse and apparel the governor of the royal citadel be bind to lend he the rest of his schoolfellow be mount likewise on horseback accompany he to the banquet house sing diverse song to the praise of God and of Mahumet then be they bring to a most sumptuous banquet whereat all the kinsfolk of the foresay boy father be usual present every one of who bestow on the schoolmaster some small gift and the boy father give he a new suit of apparel the say scholar likewise use to celebrate a feast upon the birthday of Mahumet and then their father be bind to send each man a torch unto the school whereupon every boy carry a torch in his hand some of which weigh thirty pound these torch be most curious make be adorn round about with diverse fruit of wax which be light betimes in the morning do burn till sunrise in the mean while certain singer resound the praise of Mahumet and so soon as the sun be up all their solemnity cease this day use to be very gainful unto the schoolmaster for they sell the remnant of the wax upon the torch for a hundred ducat and sometime for more none of they pay any rent for his school for all their school be build many year ago and be free bestow for the train up of youth whatsoever ornament or toy be upon the (@) the schoolmaster divide they among their scholar and among the singer both in these common school and also in the college they have two day of recreation every week wherein they neither teach nor study of the fortune-teller and some other artisan in Fez. we have say nothing as yet of the leatherdresser who have diverse mansion by the river side pay for every skin a halfpenny custom which amount yearly almost unto three hundred ducat here be likewise surgeon and barber who because they be so few I think not to have mention in this place now let we speak of the fortune-teller and diviner of who there be a great number and three kind for one three sort of diviner in Fez. sort use certain geomanticall figure other pour a drop of oil into a vial or glass of water make the say water to be transparent and bright wherein as it be in a mirror they affirm that they see huge swarm of devil that resemble a whole army some whereof be travel some be pass over a river and other fight a land-battell who when the divine see at quiet he demand such question of they as he be desirous to be resolve of and the devil give they answer with beckon or with some gesture of their hand or eye so inconsiderate and damnable be their credulity in this behalf the foresay glasse-viall they will deliver into child hand scarce of eight year old of who they will ask whether they see this or that devil many of the city be so besot with these vanity that they spend great sum upon they the three kind of diviner be women-witche which be affirm to have familiarity with devil some devil they call red some white and some black devil and when they will tell any man fortune they perfume themselves with certain odour say that then they possess themselves with that devil which they call for afterward change their voice they feign the devil to speak within they then they which come to inquire ought with great fear and tremble ask these vile and abominable witch such question as they mean to propound and last offer some fee unto the devil they depart but the wise and honest sort of people call these woman sahaoat which in latin signify fricatrice because they have a damnable custom to commit unlawful venery among themselves which I can express in any modest term if fair woman come unto they at any time these abominable witch will burn in lust towards they no otherwise then lusty yoonker do towards young maid and will in the devil behalf demand for a reward that they may lie with they and so by this mean it often fall out that think thereby to fulfil the devil command they lie with the witch yea some there be which be allure with the delight of this abominable vice will desire the company of these witch and feign themselves to be sick will either call one of the witch home to they or will send their husband for the same purpose and so the witch perceive how the matter stand will say that the woman be possess with a devil and that she can no way be cure unless she be admit into their society with these word her silly husband be persuade do not only permit she so to do but make also a sumptuous banquet unto the damn crew of witch which be do they use to dance very strange at the noise of drum and so the poor man commit his false wife to their filthy disposition howbeit some there be that will soon conjure the devil with a good cudgel out of their wife other feign themselves to be possess with a devil will deceive the say witch as their wife have be deceive by they of the conjurer enchanter and juggler in Fez. in Fez likewise there be a kind of juggler or conjurer call Muhazzimin who of all other be report to be most speedy caster out of devil and because their necromancy sometime take effect it be a wonder to see into what reputation they grow thereby but when they can cast forth a devil they say it be a airy spirit their manner of adjure devil be this first they draw certain character and circle upon a ash-heape or some other place then describe they certain sign upon the hand and forehead of the party possess and perfume he after a strange kind of manner afterwards they make their enchantment or conjuration inquire of the devil which way or by what mean he enter the party as likewise what he be and by what name he be call and last charge he to come forth other there be that work by a certain cabalistical rule call Zairagia this rule be contain in many write for it be think to be natural magic neither be there any other necromancer in all Fez that will more certain and true resolve a doubtful question howbeit their art be exceed difficult for the student thereof must have as great skill in astrology as in cabala myself in time past have attain to some knowledge in this faculty continue I remember a whole day in describe one figure only which kind of figure be describe in manner follow first they draw many circle within the compass of a great circle in the first circle they make a cross at the four extremity whereof they set down the four quarter of the world to wit east west north and south at each end of one of the say cross line they note either pole likewise about the circumference of the first circle they paint the four element then divide they the same circle and the circle follow into four part and every four part they divide into other seven each one be distinguish with certain great arabian character so that every element contain eight and twenty character in the three circle they set down the seven planet in the four the twelve sign of the zodiac in the five the twelve latin name of the month in the six the eight and twenty house of the moon in the seven the 365. day of the year and about the convexity thereof the four cardinal or principal wind then take they one only letter of the question propound multiply the same by all the particular aforenamed and the product or sum total they divide after a certain manner place it in some room according to the quality of the character and as the element require wherein the say character be find without a figure all which be do they mark that figure which seem to agree with the foresay number or sum produce wherewith they proceed as they do with the former till they have find eight and twenty character whereof they make one word and of this word the speech be make that resolve the question demand this speech be always turn into a verse of the first kind which the arabian call Ethavil consist of eight and twelve according to the meet of the arabian tongue whereof we have entreat in the last part of a arabian grammar write by John leo. our arabian grammar and the verse consist of those character comprehend always a true and infallible answer unto the question propound resolve first that which be demand and then expound the sense of the question itself these practitioner be never find to err which cause their art of cabala to be have in great admiration which although it be account natural yet never see I any thing that have more affinity with supernatural and divine knowledge I remember that I see in a certain open place of king Abulunan his college in Fez upon a floor pave with excellent smooth marble the description of a figure each side of this floor or court be fifty (@) long and yet two three part thereof be occupy about the figure and about the thing pertain thereto three there be that make the description every one attend his appoint place and they be a whole day in set it down another such figure I see at Tunis draw by one that be marvelous cunning in the art who father have write two volume of commentary or exposition upon the precept of the same art wherein whosoever have exact skill be most high esteem of by all man I myself never see but three of this profession namely one at Tunis and two other at Fez likewise I have see two exposition upon the precept of the say art together with a commentary of one margian father unto the foresay cabalist which I see at Tunis and another write by Ibnu caldim the historiographer and if any be desirous to see the precept and commentary of that art he may do it with the expense of fifty ducat for sail to Tunis a town near unto Italy he may have a sight of all the particular aforesaid I myself have fit opportunity divination and soothsay forbid by the law of (@) of time and a teacher that offer to instruct i in the same art howbeit I think good not to accept his offer because the say art be forbid and account heretical by the law of Mahumet for mahumets law affirm all kind of divination to be vain and that God only know secret and thing to come wherefore sometime the say cabalist be imprison by the mahometan inquisitour who cease not to persecute the professor of that art of certain rule and stition observe in the Mahumet a law here also you may find certain learned man which will have themselves call wizard and moral philosopher they observe certain rule which Mahumet never prescribe by some they be account catholic or true mahumetan and by other they be hold for heretic howbeit the great part of the common people reverence they as if they be god notwithstanding they commit many thing unlawful and forbid diverse mahometan sect by the mahometan law as namely whereas the say law forbid any love-matter to be express in any musical ditty or song these moralist affirm the contrary in the foresay mahometan religion be a great number of rule or sect every of which have most learned patroness and protector the foresay sect spring up fourscore year after Mahumet the first author thereof be call Elhesen Abilhasen and be bear in the town of Basora this man teach his disciple and follower certain precept but write he leave none behind he about a hundred year after there come another notable doctor of that sect from bagaded call Elharit Ibnu ese who leave volume of write unto his disciple afterwards those that be find to be his follower be all condemn by the mahometan patriarch and lawyer howbeit 80. year after that sect begin to revive again under a certain famous professor who draw after he many disciple unto who he publish his doctrine this man at length and all his follower be by the patriarch and lawyer condemn to die which he understanding write forthwith unto the patriarch request that he may be license to dispute with the lawyer as touch his doctrine of who if he be convince he will most willing suffer death otherwise that it will be against all equity that so many innocent shall perish upon a unjust accusation the patriarch think his demand to be reasonable condescend whole thereunto but when the matter come to disputation the party condemn soon put all the lawyer to silence which when the patriarch perceive he revoke the sentence as unjust and cause many college and monastery to be erect for the say party and his follower after which time this sect continue about a hundred year till the emperor Malicsach of the turkish race come thither out of Asia the great and destroy all the maintainer thereof whereupon some of they flee unto cairo and the rest into Arabia be disperse here and there for the space of twenty year till in the reign of Caselsah nephew unto one of his counsellor and a man of a high spirit be addict unto the say sect so restore erect and confirm the same that by the help of one Elgazzuli a most learned man who have write of the same argument a notable work divide into seven part he reconcile the lawyer with the disciple of this sect conditional that the lawyer shall be call conserver of the prophet Mahumet his law and the sectary reformer of the same this concord last between they till bagade be sack by the tartar which befall in the year of the Hegeira (@) sack by the tartar 656. at what time those sectary so increase that they swarm almost over all Africa and Asia neither will they admit any into their society but such as be very learned and train up in all kind of liberal science to the end they may the better defend their own opinion and confute their adversary but now adays they admit all kind of rude and ignorant person affirm all sort of learning to be needless for the holy spirit say they reveal the knowledge of the truth unto such as be of a clean hart and they allege many reason for the confirmation of this their opinion though not very forcible wherefore despise their ancestor rite and the strict observation of the law they addict themselves to nought else but delight and pleasure feast often and sing lascivious song sometime they will rend their garment either allude thereby to the verse that they sing or be move thereunto by their corrupt and vile disposition say false that they be then ravish with a fit of divine love but I rather impute it to their abundance of meat and gluttony for each one of they will devour as much meat as may well suffice three or which be more likely they utter those passionate clamour and out-cry because they be inflame with unlawful and filthy lust for sometime it happen that some one of the principal of they with all his scholar and disciple be (@) to the marriage of some gentleman and at the begin of the banquet they will rehearse their devout orison and song but so soon as they be rise from the table the elder of the company be about to dance tear their garment and if any one in the midst of their dance that have drink immoderate chance to fall down he be take up forthwith by one of the scholar and to too lascivious kiss whereupon this proverb grow among the people of Fez the heremite banquet which they use in reproach of those master that make their scholar their minion of diverse other rule and sect and of the superstitious credulity of many among these sect there be some that have not only a diverse law but also a different belief from the residue whereupon by some other they be call heretic some there be also which hold that a man by good work by fast and abstinence may attain unto the nature of a angel which good work fast etc. do say they so purge and free the mind from all contagion of evil that by no mean it can sin any more though it will never so fain howbeit they think themselves not capable of this felicity before they have ascend thereunto by the degree of fifty discipline or science and although they fall into sin before they be come to the fifty degree yet they say that God will not impute that sin unto they these fellow indeed in the beginning lead a most strict life and do even macerate and consume themselves with fast but afterward they give themselves to all licentiousness and pleasure they have also a most severe form of live set down in four book by a certain learned man of their faction call sehravard and bear in the city of Corasan likewise there be another author call ibnul Farid that describe all their religion in witty verse which be fraught with allegory seem to entreat of nought but love wherefore one Elfargani expound the say verse with a commentary and thereout gather the canon and order of the sect and show the degree to the attainment of felicity moreover the say verse be so sweet and elegant that the maintainer of this sect will sing and repeat none other in their banquet for these three hundred year no author have so adorn their language as the say ibnul these sectary take the heaven the element the planet and the fix star to be one god and that no law nor religion be erroneous for every man say they may lawful worship that which his mind be most addict to worship they think that all the knowledge of God be infuse into one man who they call in their language Elcorb this man they say be elect by god and be make equal in knowledge to he forty there be among they call all by the name of elauted which signify in our language a block or stock of a tree out of this number when their decease they create another in his room namely seventy person that have the authority of election commit unto they there be likewise 765. other who name I do not well remember who be choose into the say elector room when any of they decease these 765. be bind thereunto by a certain canon or rule of their order be constrain always to go unknown and they range almost all the world over in a most vile and beggarly habit so that a man will take they for mad man and estrange from all sense of humanity for these lewd miscreant under pretence of their religion run like rogue naked and savage throughout all Africa have so little regard of honesty or shame that they will like brute beast ravish woman in public place and yet forsooth the gross common people reverence they as man of wonder holiness great swarm of these filthy vagabond you may see in Tunis but many more in Egypt and especial at alcair whereas in the market call bain elcasrain I see one of these villain with i own eye in the presence of much people deflower a most beautiful woman as she be come forth of the bath which be do the fond people come flock about the say woman strive to touch her garment as a most holy thing say that the adulterer be a man of great sanctity and that he do not commit the sin but only seem to commit it which when the silly cuckold her husband understand he show himself thankful to his false god with a solemn banquet and with liberal give of alm the magistrate of the city will have punish the adulterer but they be in hazard to be slay of the people for their labour who as be before say adore these varlet for saint and man of singular holiness other more villainous act I see commit by they which I be ashamed to report of the caballiste and certain other sect likewise there be another sort of man which we may fit call cabalist these fast most strait neither do they eat the flesh of any live creature but have certain meat and garment allot unto they they rehearse likewise certain set-praier appoint for every hour of the day and for the night according to the variety of day and month and they use to carry about certain square table with character and number engrave therein they feign themselves to have daily conference with the angel of who they learn they say the knowledge of all thing they have once a famous doctor of their sect call (@) who be author of their canon prayer and square table which when I see i think their profession have more affinity with magic then with cabala their art be divide into eight part whereof the first be call Elumha Enormita that be the demonstration of light the which contain prayer and fast the second call semsul Meharif that be the sun of science contain the foresay square table together with their use and profit the three part they call (@) Lasmei Elchusne this part contain a catalogue of those 99 virtue which they say be contain in the name of God which I remember I see at Rome in the custody of a certain Venetian Jew they have also a certain other rule call Suvach that be the rule of heremite the professor and follower whereof inhabit wood and solitary place neither have they any other food but such as those wild desert will afford the conversation of these heremite no man be able exact to describe because they be estrange from all human society but if I shall take upon i to describe the variety of mahometan sect I shall digress too far from my present purpose he that desire to know more of this matter let he read over the book of Elefacni who discourse at large of the sect 72. principal sect in the religion of Mahumet belong to the mahometan religion the principal whereof be 72. every one of which defend their opinion to be true and good and such as a man may attain salvation by at this day you shall find but two principal sect only the one of Leshari be disperse over all Africa Egypt Syria Arabia and Turkey the other of Imamia which be authorize throughout the whole kingdom of Persia and in certain town of Corasan and this sect the great sophi of Persia maintain insomuch that all Asia have like to be destroy thereabouts for whereas before they follow the sect of Leshari the great sophi by force of arm establish his own of Imamia and yet one only sect stretch over all the mahometan dominion of such as search for treasure in Fez. moreover in the city of Fez there be certain man call Elcanesin who suppose to find treasure under the foundation of old house do perpetual search and delve these gross fellow use to resort unto certain den and cave without the citie-walle certain persuade themselves that when the roman be chase out of Africa and drive into baetica or Granada in Spain they hide great abundance of treasure in the bowel of the earth which they can not carry with they and so enchant the same by art-magique that it can by no mean be attain unto but by the same art wherefore they seek unto enchanter to teach they the art of dig up the say treasure some of they there be that will steadfast affirm that they see gold in this or that cave other that they see silver but can not dig it out by reason that they be destitute of perfume and enchantment fit for the purpose so that be seduce with this vain opinion and deep delve into the earth they turn upside down the foundation of house and sepulchre and sometime they proceed in this manner ten or twelve day journey from Fez yea so fond they be and so besot that they esteem those book that profess the art of dig gold as divine oracle before my departure from Fez these fantastical people have choose they a consul and get licence of certain owner to dig their ground when they have dig as much as they think good they pay the say owner for all damage commit of the alchemisst of Fez. in this city likewise there be great store of alchemist which be mighty addict to that vain practice they be most base fellow and contaminate themselves with the steam of sulphur and other stink smell in the evening they use to assemble themselves at the great temple where they dispute of their false opinion they have of their art of alchemy many book write by learned man among which one geber be of principal account who live a hundred year after Mahumet and be a greek bear be say to have renounce his own religion this geber his work and all his precept be full of allegory or dark borrow speech likewise they have another author that write a huge volume of the same art entitle by the name of Attogrehi this man be secretary unto the sultan of bagaded of who we have write in the life of the arabian philosopher a book write by John (@) of the life of the arabian philosopher also the song or article of the say science be write by one Mugairibi of Granada whereupon a most learned mamaluch of Damascus write a commentary yet so that a man may much more easy understand the text than the exposition thereof of alchemisst here be two sort whereof the one seek for the elissir that be the matter which colour brass and other metal and the other be conversant about multiplication of the quantity of metal whereby they may convenient temper the same but their chief drift be to coin counterfeit money for which cause you shall see most of they in Fez with their hand cut off of charmer andinchanter of snake in this city likewise there be a great swarm of base people such as the italian common call Ciurmatori these sing foolish song and rhyme in all the street of the city and broach mere trifle with the music of drum harp and cittern they sell unto the rude people certain scroll or brief charm instead of preservative unto these you may add another kind of refuse people of one family and disposition with the former who carry dance ape up and down and have their neck and arm all entwine with (@) snake these also profess geomancy and persuade woman that they can foretell they their (@) likewise they carry stone-horse about with they which for a certain fee they will let other have to cover their mare I can here reckon up more sort of people but let it suffice to have admonish in this place that the great part of the forename be people of most base condition and such as bear little good will to stranger albeit there be but a few in this city by reason it be distant more than a hundred mile from the sea the way thither also be rough and dangerous their gentle man be very stately and high mind and will have little or no familiarity at all with the citizen so likewise the doctor and judge of principal account will admit but few unto their acquaintance this city itself be most beautiful and right commodious situate where albeit in winter time the street be so miry that you can walk in they without startup yet they let pass such abundance of water out of their conduct that all the filth be wash clean away where conduct be want they carry all the dirt in cart unto the next part of the river a description of the suburb without the foresay city of Fez. without the wall of this city westward stand a suburb contain almost five hundred family the house whereof be but mean and the inhabitant base as namely driver of camel water-bearer and cleaver of wood for the king palace yet here you may find diverse shop and all kind of artificer here likewise dwell all the charmer and roguish minstrel before name as also great swarm of sluttish and filthy harlot in the principal street of this suburb you shall find certain cave most artificial hew out of excellent marble wherein the noble man of Fez be wont to lay up their corn but after that by reason of the war it be often take from thence they have since usual convey their corn into new Fez and there store it up and from that time to this the marble-cave have remain desolate it be a wonder to see how wide and large these cave be for the least of they will contain more than a thousand measure of corn there be above a hundred and fifty of they in all but now they lie waste and open insomuch that diverse fall into they at unaware for which cause their brim be environ with wall here every one may play the vintner and the bawd so that this suburb may just be call the sink of Fez. from the twenty hour you shall see none at all in their shop for then every man run to the tavern to disport to spend riotous and to be drunken another suburb there be allot unto the leper of who there be two hundred family these leprous person the habitation of leper in Fez and their governor have a governor which gather certain yearly revenue from the nobleman and take such care of the say leper that they want no necessary thing he be bind by his office to discharge the city of all leprous person and to compel all such as he understand to be infect with that disease to depart into the foresay suburb if any leper chance to die without issue part of his good be employ to the common benefit of the leper and part fall to the governor share but if he have any child they enjoy his good among the leper also those be place which be infect with white botch or with any other incurable malady next beyond stand another suburb inhabit only with muleteer plasterer and woodmonger which although it be but little yet contain it about a hundred and fifty family moreover upon the way lead westward from the city there be another great suburb of more than four hundred house howbeit they be low and base and the inhabitant be beggarly which neither can nor will dwell among any other people by this suburb there be a certain broad plain which lead to the river two mile off and extend westward almost three mile upon this plain every week there be a exceed great market of cattle likewise the shopkeeper of the city resort hither and sell their ware in tent also a certain company of gentleman use to come hither and to divide a ram among themselves leave the head unto the butcher for his fee but the foot and the skin they sell unto the wooll-chapman for those ware that be here sell they pay so little tribute to the king that it be not worth the mention but this one thing I must in no wise pass over in silence namely that I never see neither in Asia Africa nor Italy a market either more populous or better furnish with ware not far from Fez stand certain high rock environ with a ditch of two mile compass out of which rock certain matter be hew to make lime withal near unto the say ditch be many furnace some whereof be so large that they will contain more than six thousand measure of lime and this lime be make at the cost of the rich citizen in Fez. westward without the wall of Fez by the river side stand about a hundred cottage which be only inhabit by they that white linen cloth hither in the spring and in summer use the citizen to bring their linen cloth spread it upon the meadow and as often as they see it dry in the sun cast water thereupon which water they fetch either out of the river or out of some cistern in certain leather tankard make for the same purpose but at night each one carry his cloth into the foresay cottage neither be the meadow wherein they bleach their cloth ever destitute of grass a most gallant prospect it be to behold a far off the white clothes disperse over the green meadow and the crystal stream of the river which seem to be of a azure hue run along all which the poet have celebrate in their verse a description of the common place of burial without the city many field there be without the city which have be give by certain nobleman for the burial of the dead upon their sepulchre for the most part they lay a long threesquare stone when any noble man or any principal citizen decease they lie one stone over his head and another over his foot whereon use to be engrave some epitaph with the day and year when the party decease I myself bestow much labour in gather of epitaph which I see both about Fez and in other place of Barbary all which be set down in a book I give unto the king brother the matter of their epitaph be diverse some tend to consolation and other to sorrow of the sepulcher of the king of Fez. northward of the city upon a certain high hill stand a palace wherein be the monument of diverse marin king be most artificial hew out of marble with epitaph upon they so that I can condign express the majesty and beauty thereof a description of their garden without the north east and south part of the city be great store of garden replenish with all kind of fruit and with stately tree through the midst of these gardenn they derive some small vain of the river some whereof be so full of tree that you will take they for grove rather than for garden these garden they manure not at all but only water they continual in the month of May whereupon they have great abundance of fruit all their fruit save their peach only be of a most delicate taste whereof so soon as they be ripe above five hundred cart-loades be daily carry into the market beside grape which here I do not mention but the say fruit be carry unto a certain place in Fez where tribute be pay for they they be sell by crier unto the fruiterer there present in the same place likewise after pay of tribute they sell certain negro-slave towards the east of Fez lie a plain fifteen mile broad and thirty mile long this plain be full of fountain and freshet and be reserve for the use of the great temple it be farm out unto gardiner who sow thereupon such abundance of hemp melon turnip or navewe radish and other such like root and herb that every summer there be say to be gather thereof above fifteen thousand cartload and as many in winter howbeit the air be very unwholesome thereabouts for the inhabitant be continual vex with fever and be of a yellowish colour of that part of Fez which be call new Fez. new Fez be environ with a high and impregnable wall and situate on a most beautiful plain not far from the river side be almost a mile distant from old Fez and that upon the east and south side thereof between the wall of either town to the northward enter a certain arm of the river where the foresay mill do stand and the other part of the river be sever into two branch one whereof run between new Fez and old Fez not far from the edge of the rock and the other pass through certain valley and garden trend at length southward the other part of the river hold on his course by the rock and so by the college of king * * * * or Aburinan Abutiman this city of new Fez jacob the son of Abdultach cause to (@) build who be the first king of the marin family and expel the king of Maroco and usurp the kingdom unto himself but the founder of new Fez. the king of Telensin to the end he may make the people of Maroco behold unto he and may subvert the prosperous success of the marin family go about to hinder the king of Fez his attempt against Maroco wherefore king jacob have finish the war of Maroco determine to revenge himself to the uttermost for the injury offer by they of Telensin but consider with himself that the strong town of his own kingdom be far distant from Telensin he think it a better course to build this city whereunto the seat royal of all Maroco may be translate which be erect he call the white city but it be afterward name by the inhabitant new Fez. this city king jacob the founder divide into three part whereof the first contain his royal palace and diverse noble man house unto every one of which he allot a most pleasant garden not far from his palace he build a most stately and sumptuous temple in another part of this city he build a large and fair stable for the king horse to stand in then also he cause other palace to be erect for his captain and principal courtier from the west gate to the east he appoint the market place the distance between which gate be a mile and a half and on both side he place artificer and merchant shop at the west gate he cause a fair portal to be set up to harbour the watchman and warder of the city not far from thence he erect two stable sufficient to contain three hundred horse which he may use for the protection of his own palace the three part of the city be appoint for the king guard and attendant which be most of they bear eastward of Fez neither have they any other weapon but hand-bowe for crossbow be not then use in that kingdom unto which attendant the king allow a large stipend but now the same place be full of beautiful temple and stove near unto the king palace stand the mint have in the midst a fower-square court with certain portal or cell round about it wherein the money-minters dwell likewise there be another lodging in the midst of the same court where the governor of the mint with his scribe and notary have their abode here as well as in any other place whatsoever commodity be raise redound whole to the king near unto the mint stand the goldsmith shop who consul or governor keep the seal and stamp of the coin in Fez neither ring nor any other jewel or commodity can be make of silver or gold before the metal be seal for the offender be most severe punish and the metal be seal whatsoever be make thereof be weigh as if it be money the great part of goldsmith dwell in new Fez be jew who carry their vessel of gold and silver unto a certain place of old Fez near unto the grocer shop and there sell they for in old Fez neither gold nor silver be coin nor any mahometan be suffer to be goldsmith because they have usurer among they which will sell any piece of wrought silver or gold dear than the weight require albeit the same privilege be by the governor of the city grant unto the jew some there be also that only make plate for the citizen who be pay hire only for their work that part of the city which the king attendant or guard once possess be now inhabit by jew for now a day the king use no such guard the jew indeed first dwell in old Fez but upon the death of a certain king they be all rob by the moor whereupon king abusabid cause they to remove into new Fez and by that mean double their yearly tribute they therefore even till this day do occupy a long street in the say new city wherein they have their shop and synagogue and their number be marvellous increase ever since they be drive out of Spain these jew be have in great contempt by all man neither be any of they permit to wear shoe but they make they certain sock of sea-rush on their head they wear a black * * * orturbant dulipan and if any will go in a cap he must fasten a red cloth thereunto they pay unto the king of Fez monthly four hundred ducat at length within the space of a hundred and forty year this new city be environ with most impregnable wall and adorn with temple college palace and other such building as serve to beautify a city so that I engine for the conveyance of water think there be more bestow in garnish of the city then in building of the wall without the citie-walle be build many huge wheel or engine for the convey of river-water over the say wall into cistern from whence it be convey in certain channel and pipe unto the temple garden and palace the say wheel be build not full a hundred year past before which time water be bring unto the city by a certain conduct from a fountain ten mile distant of which artificial conduct a certain genovese be then in great favour with the king be report to have be the author but the wheel they say be invent by a Spaniard and in they there be marvelous cunning workmanship for to the conveyance of so huge a quantity of water each wheel be turn about but four and twenty time only in a day and a night to conclude here be but few gentleman in this city except such as attend upon the court for the residue be base and mechanical people but such as carry any show of honesty do so hate and disdain the king courtier and gentleman that they will by no mean vouchsafe to marry their daughter unto they of the fashion and custom use in the king court among all the prince of Africa I never red of any that be create by the common suffrage and consent of the people unto his kingdom or princedom or that be call from any strange province or city to bear rule also by the law of Mahumet no man may bear any secular authority which may be call lawful save only the mahometan patriarch and prelate howbeit the say patriarch authority decrease daily more and more the ringleader of such people as range up and down the desert begin to invade place inhabit and civilize and by force of arm against mahumets law and maugre his prelate to ordain sundry prince as for example in the east whereas the turk cordian and tartar have usurp dominion over such as be not able to repel they so likewise in the west part first the family of Zeneta and Luntuna than the seditious mahometan preacher and afterward the family of marin get the upper hand howbeit the family of Luntuna be report to have aid the western region and to have release they from the fury of the seditious heretic wherein they show themselves friend and not enemy but afterward their tyranny begin to show itself and this be the reason why they do not now a day attain unto government by hereditary succession or by election of the people or of the nobility but the prince himself when he feel death seize upon he call about he all his peer and noble and bind they by oath to establish his son brother or any other who he most favour in his kingdom but they after the prince decease neglect their oath will choose any other who they list and this be ordinary the election of the king of Fez who so soon as he be proclaim king choose forthwith some one of his noble to be his chief counsellor and on he he bestow the three part of all his kingly revenue the manner of choose officer in the court of Fez. then choose another to be his secretary treasurer and high steward of his household then be create the captain of the horseman appoint for the king guard and these horseman with their horse live most common in the field last he appoint a new governor over every city unto who all the tribute and revenue of the same place redound with condition that as often as any war betide he shall maintain a certain company of horse to the king service after a while also he place certain deputy and commissioner over his people inhabit the mountain and over the arabian subject unto he the governor of city diverse administer justice according to the custom of the place some there be also appoint by the king to collect all the tribute and revenue of his kingdom and due to pay the same unto he likewise there be other choose who they call in their language keeper or guardian and unto every one of these the king give some castle or village whereby he may procure his own maintenance and be able to serve the king in time of war moreover the king of Fez maintain a troop of light horseman who so long as they serve the king in his camp have their diet allow they out of the king provision but in time of peace he find they corn butter and pouldered flesh for the whole year but money they have very seldom once a year they be apparel at the king cost neither do they provide for their horse either within the city or without for the king furnish they with all necessary those that give attendance to their horse be christian captive which go shackle in great chain and fetter but when the army remove any whither the say christian be carry upon camel back another officer there be that give attendance only to the camel assign certain pasture unto the herdsman and divide field among they and make such provision for the king camel as himself shall think expedient each camel-driver have two camel which be lade with the king furniture according to the appointment of the governor likewise the king have a certain purveyor or steward who office be to provide keep and distribute corn both to the king household and to his army this man in time of war have ten or twelve tent to lay up corn in and every day with change of camel he send for new corn lest the army shall be unprovided of victual he have also cook at his command moreover there be a governor or mastergroome of the stable who provide for the king horse mule and camel and be furnish with all necessary by the steward there be another also appoint overseer of the corn who duty it be to provide barley and other provender for the beast and this man have his scribe and notary about he who diligent set down all particular expense for they must give up a perfect account unto the chief steward they have also a certain captain over fifty horseman which horseman may well be call pursuivant for they be send by the secretary in the king name to do his business likewise the Fezzan king have another captain of great name be as it be governor of his guard who in the king name may compel the judge to do justice and to put their sentence in execution this man authority be so great that sometime he may commit principal nobleman to ward and may severe punish they according to the king commandment moreover the say king have a most trusty chancellor who keep the great seal and write and sign the king letter he have also a great number of footman the governor of who accept and dismiss who he think good and give to every one wage according to his agility and desert and whensoever the king come in place of judgement the say governor always attend upon he and be in a manner his high chamberlain also there be another that take charge of the carriage and baggage of the army and cause the tent of the light horseman to be carry up and down on mule and the tent of the other soldier on camel there be likewise a company of ensigne-bearer who in march on a journey carry their colour wrap up but he that go before the army have his banner display and of a great height and every one of the say standard-bearer know most exact always ford of river and passage through wood wherefore they be for the most part appoint to guide the army the drummer of who there be great store in the king host play upon certain drum of brass as big as a great kettle the low part whereof be narrow and the upper broad be cover with a skin these drummer ride on horseback have always on the one side of their horse a great weight hang down to counterpoise the heaviness of their drum on the other side they be allow most swift horse because the moor account it a great disgrace to loose a drum the say drum make such a loud and horrible noise that they be not only hear a far off but also strike exceed terror both upon man and horse and they be beat only with a bull pizzle the musician be not maintain at the king charge for the city be bind at their cost to send a certain number of they to the war who according to their demeanour in the war be admit or not admit unto the king table this king have also a certain master of ceremony who sit at his foot in the senate-house and command each man to sit down and to speak according to his dignity all the maidservant in the king family be negro-slave which be partly chamberlain and partly waiting-maid and yet his queen be always of a white skin likewise in the king of Fez his court be certain christian captive be partly Spanish and partly Portugal woman who be most circumspect keep by certain eunuch that be negro-slave the king of Fez have very large dominion but his revenue be small to wit scare three hundred thousand ducat the five part whereof redound not to the king for the remainder be divide into sundry portion as we have before signify yea the great part of the say revenue be pay in corn cattle oil and butter all which yield but small store of money in some place they pay a ducat and one four part tribute for every acre but in other place a whole family pay but so much in some other region each man above fifteen year of age pay as much tribute also neither be the people of this great city more vex with any thing then with pay of their tribute and imposition here also be to be note that the mahometan governor the priest only except may not exact great revenue than those that Mahumet have allot unto they namely of every of their subject which possess 100 ducat in ready money they be to have two ducat and a half for yearly tribute every husbandman likewise be bind to pay for tribute the ten part of all his corn and all the say tribute he appoint to be pay unto the patriarch who shall bestow that which be superfluous for the prince to have upon common use namely for the relieve of poor impotent people and widow and for maintain of war against the enemy but since the patriarch begin to decay the prince as we have beforesaid exercise tyranny for it be not sufficient for they to exact all the forename tribute and riotous to consume the same but also to urge people unto great contribution so that all the inhabitant of Africa be so oppress with daily exaction that they have scarce wherewithal to feed and apparel themselves for which cause there be almost no man of learning or honesty that will seek any acquaintance with courtier or will invite they to his table or accept any gift be they never so precious at their hand think that whatsoever good they have be get by theft and bribery the king of Fez continual maintain the king of Fez his guard six thousand horseman five hundred crossbow and as many harquebusier be at all assay prepare for the war who in time of peace when the king go on progress lie within a mile of his person for be at home in Fez he need not so strong a guard when he wage how the king of Fez ride on progress war against the arabian that be his enemy because the forename garrison be not sufficient he require aid of the arabian his subject who at their own cost find he a great army of man better train to the war than his own soldier beforementioned the pomp and ceremony of this king be but mean neither do he willing use they but only upon festival day and when mere necessity require when the king be to ride forth the master of ceremony signify so much unto certain herbenger or post whereupon the herbenger give notice thereof unto the king * * * * * or kine folk parent unto his nobility his senator captain guardian and gentleman who present arrange themselves before the palace gate at the king come forth of the palace the herbenger appoint unto each man his place and order of ride first and foremost go the standard-bearer next the drummer then follow the chief groom of the stable with his servant and family after he come the king pensioner his guard his master of ceremony his secretary his treasurer and last of all his chief judge and his captain general at length come the king accompany with his principal counsellor or with some other great peer before the king also ride certain officer belong to his person whereof one carry his sword-royall another his shield and the three his crossbow on each side of he march his footman one carry a payer of stirrup another the king partisan the three a cover for his saddle and the four a halter for his horse and so soon as the king be dismount they forthwith cover his saddle and put the foresay halter upon his horsehead likewise there be another footman that carry the king pantofle most artificial wrought after the king follow the captain of the footman than the eunuch the king family the light horseman and last of all the crossbow and harquebusier the apparel of the king be then very moderate and plain insomuch that if a man know he not he will think he to be absent for the attendant be far more sumptuous attire moreover no mahometan king or prince may wear a crown diadem the king of Fez his (@) of warfare or any such like ornament upon his head for that be forbid by the law of Mahumet when the king lie with his army in the field first his own great tent be pitch in a four square form like unto a castle each side of the say square be fifty else in length at every of the four corner stand a little sharp turret make of cloth with a gallant sphere on the top which glister like gold this royal pavilion have four gate every one of which be keep by eunuch within the say pavilion be contain diverse other tent among which be the king lodging be frame in such wise that it may easy be remove from place to place next unto it stand the tent of the nobleman and of such as be most in the king favour then the lodging of the principal guard be make of goates-skinne after the arabian fashion and in the midst of all stand the king kitchen and his pantry not far from hence the light horseman have their abode who all of they be victual out of the king storehouse notwithstanding their attire be very base next of all be the stable wherein their horse be marvelous well tend without this circuit keep such as carry the tent and the king furniture from place to place here be also butcher victualler and such like all merchant and artificer that resort hither take up their abode next unto the tent-carrier so that the king pavilion be pitch like a strong city for it be so environ with the lodging of the guard and with other tent adjoin that there be very difficult passage to the king round about the say royal pavilion there be certain appoint to watch and ward all night long howbeit they be base and unarmed people in like sort there be a watch keep about the stable but sometime so negligent that not only some horse have be steal but there have be find enemy in the king own pavilion that come to murder he the king live the great part of the year in the field both for the safeguard of his kingdom and also that he may keep his arabian subject in obedience and sometime he recreate himself with hunt and sometime with play at chess I know right well how tedious I have be in the description of this city but because it be the metropolitan not only of Barbary but of all Africa I think good most particular to decipher every parcel and member thereof of the town of Macarmeda this town stand almost twenty mile eastward of Fez and be build by the family of Zeneta upon the bank of a most beautiful river it have in time past a large territory and great store of inhabitant on both side of the say river be many garden and vineyard the king of Fez be wont to assign this town unto the governor of their camel but in the war of sahid it be so destroy and waste that at this day scarce be there any mention of wall to be find but the field thereof be now in the possession of certain gentleman of Fez and of the peasant of the castle of hubbed this castle stand upon the side of a hill about six mile from Fez and from hence you may behold the city of Fez and all the territory adjacent it be found by a certain hermit of Fez be repute for a man of singular holiness the field thereto belong be not very large because the house be demolish it be utter destitute of inhabitant the wall only and the temple as yet remain in this castle I live four summer because it stand in a most pleasant air be separate from concourse of people and a solitary place fit for a man to study in for my father have get a lease of the ground adjoin to this castle from the governor of the temple for many year of the town of Zavia the town of Zavia be found by joseph the second king of the marin-famy and be distant from Fez about fowerteene mile here king joseph build a stately hospital and command that his corpse shall be inter in this town but it be not his fortune here to be bury for he be slay in the war against tremizen from thencefoorth Zavia fall to decay and grow destitute of inhabitant wherein at this present the hospital only remain the revenue of this place be give unto the great temple of Fez but the field thereof be till by certain arabian dwell in the region of Fez. of the castle of Chaulan the ancient castle of Chaulan be build upon the river Sebu eight mile a (@) (@) southward of Fez. not far from this castle there be a certain hot bath whereunto Abulhezen the four king of the marin-famy add a fair building unto this bath once a year in the month of April the gentleman of Fez usual resort remain there four or five day together there be no civility to be find in this castle for the inhabitant be base people and exceed covetous of the mountain of zelag this mountain begin eastward from the river of Sebu extend thence almost fowerteene mile westward and the high part thereof to the north be seven mile distant from Fez. the south part of this mountain be utter destitute of inhabitant but the north side be exceed fertile and plant with great store of castle and town most of their field be employ about vineyard the grape whereof be the sweet that ever I taste and so likewise be their olive and other fruit the inhabitant be very rich have most of they house in the city of Fez. and so likewise most part of the gentleman of Fez have vineyard upon

describe of the town of Teurerto this ancient town be build upon a mountain by the african not far from the river Zha the field hereof not be very large but exceed fruitful adjoin upon a certain dry and barren desert the north part of the same border upon the desert of garet and the south upon the desert of adurha eastward thereof lie the desert of Anghad which be near unto the kingdom of * * * * or Tremisen Telensin and westward it be enclose with the desert of Tafrata which border likewise upon the town of Tezza this Teurerto be in time past a most populous and rich town and contain about three thousand family here also be stately palace temple and other such building to be see the town wall be build of most excellent marble ever since the marin-family enjoy the western kingdom of Fez this town be a occasion of great war for the marin-famy will have it belong to the crown of Fez but the king of Telensin challenge it as his own of the town of Haddagia this town be build by the african in manner of a isle for it be environ with the river Mululo which not far from hence fall into the river Muluia it be in time past a most populous and flourish town but after the arabian become lord of the west it fall by little and little to decay for it border upon the desert of Dahra which be inhabit with most lewd and mischievous arabian at the same time when Teurerto be sack this town be utter destroy also whereof nothing remain at this day but the town wall only of the castle of Garsis it stand upon a rock by the river Muluia fifteen mile distant from Teurerto here as in a most impregnable place the family of beni marin lay their provision of corn when as they inhabit the desert afterwards it become subject unto Abuhenan the five king of the marin-family it have no great quantity of arable or pasture ground belong thereto but it have a most pleasant garden replenish with grape peach and fig and environ on all side with most thick and shady wood so that it be a paradise in respect of other place thereabouts the inhabitant be rude and uncivil people neither do they ought but keep such corn as the arabian commit unto their custody if a man behold the castle a far off he will think it rather to be a cottage then a castle for the wall be in many place ruin make show of great antiquity and the roof be cover with certain black stone or slate of the town of Dubdu this ancient town be build by the african upon a exceed high and impregnable mountain and be inhabit by certain people of the family of Zeneta from the top of this mountain diverse spring come run into the town from this town the next plain be distant almost five mile and yet they seem to be but a mile and a half off for the way be very crooked and wind all the jurisdiction long to this town be only upon the top of the mountain for the plain underneath be unpleasant and barren except certain garden on either side of a little river run by the foot of the hill neither have the townsman corn grow upon the same hill sufficient for their provision unless they be supply with great store of corn from Tezza so that this town be build for a fortress only by the family of marin what time they be dispossess of the western kingdom afterwards it be inhabit by a certain family call beni Guertaggen who be lord of the say town even till this day but when the marin-famy be expel out of the kingdom of Fez the next arabian endeavour to win the town howbeit by the aid of one mose Chamu who be one of the say family the arabian be so valiant resist that they conclude a truce with the people of marin and so mose Ibnu remain governor of the town after who death his son acm succeed he who tread just in his father virtuous step keep the say town in great tranquillity even till his die day after he succeed one Mahumet a man high (@) for his noble valour and great skill in martial affair this Mahumet have before time conquer many city and castle upon the foot of the mount Atlas southward whereof border the land of Numidia but have get this town in possession he beautify it exceed with store of fair house and building likewise he great alter and reform the government of the great courtesy of Mahumet towards stranger this town and show such extraordinary courtesy unto all stranger that he grow very famous moreover the say Mahumet consult how to get Tezza from the king of Fez and offer great matter to the performance of his intent and that he may the easily attain his purpose he determine to go to the market of Tezza in a simple habit and so to make a assault upon the captain of the town for he hope that a great part of the townsman who he know to be his friend will assist he in that enterprise howbeit this practice be at length discover unto the king of Fez which king be call Saich and be the first of the family of Quattas and father unto the king that * * * 1526. now reign who present assemble a huge army and march of purpose against Dubdu utter to destroy it and so come unto the foot of the mountain he there encamp the people of the mountain have gather a army of six thousand man hide themselves crafty behind the rock suffer their enemy to ascend by certain difficult and correced reading passage from whence they be sure they can hardly escape and so at length they break forth on the sudden and encounter their say enemy be weary of ascend and because the way be very troublesome and narrow the king of Fez his soldier can not endure their assault but be constrain to give back be more than a thousand of they throw down headlong and slay in this skirmish be slay in all to the number of three thousand Fessan soldier and yet the king not be dismay with so great a overthrow prepare forthwith a band of five hundred crossbow and three hundred harquebuzier and determine to make a new assault upon the town but Mahumet see that he can no long withstand the king resolve to go himself unto he that he may if it be possible obtain peace and to release his country from the fury of the enemy wherefore put on the habit of a ambassador he go and deliver a letter with his own hand unto the king which the king have peruse ask he what he think concern the governor of Dubdu mary I think quoth Mahumet he be not well in his wit in that he go about to resist your majesty then say the king if I have conquer he as I hope to do within these few day I will cause he to be dismember and tear in piece but what if he shall come hither say Mahumet to submit himself and to acknowledge his offence may it then please the king to admit he into favour then the king answer I swear unto thou by this my head that if he will come and acknowledge his fault in manner as thou have say I will not only receive he into favour but will espouse my daughter unto his son and will bestow most ample and princely dowry upon they but I be sure be distraught of his wit as thou have say that he will by no mean come and submit himself then say Mahumet he will soon come I assure you if it please the king to protest this for a certainty unto his noble I think say the king it have be sufficient protest and affirm sithence I have bind it with a solemn oath in the presence of these four for here stand my chief secretary the general of my force my father in law and the chief judge and patriarch of Fez the testimony of which four may well satisfy you whereupon Mahumet humble fall at the king foot (@) here the man quoth he that submiss acknowledge his fault and crave the king gracious pardon with that the king himself lift he from the ground embrace he and salute he with friendly speech then cause he both his daughter to be call which he bestow upon mahumets son all which be do he remove his army from that mountain and return conqueror unto Fez. this be do in the year of the Hegeira 904. which be in the year of our lord 1495. and in the year of the Hegeira 921. I myself be at the city of Dubdu where I be most courteous entertain by the foresay Mahumet in regard of certain letter of commendation which I bring from the king of Fez and his brother neither will he cease inquire how all thing pass at the king of Fez his court of the city of Teza or Tezza this great noble and rich city of Tezza be build by the african five mile from mount Atlas be distant from Fez fifty from the ocean a hundred and thirty and from the Mediterran sea seven mile and stand in the way from garet to Chasasan it contain in time pass about five thousand family the building of this town be not very stately except nobleman palace college and temple which be somewhat beautiful out of Atlas spring a little river which run through the chief temple of this city and sometime it fall out that certain people border upon the city upon some quarrel with the citizen will cut off this river from the city and turn the course thereof some other way which breed great inconvenience unto the citizen for than they can neither build house nor get any water to drink but only corrupt water which they take out of certain cestern for which cause they be often constrain to make a league with those borderer this city both for wealth civility and abundance of people be the three city of all the kingdom and have a great temple then that at Fez here be likewise three college with diverse bathstove and a great number of hospital each trade and occupation have a several place in this city like as they have in Fez the inhabitant be of a more valiant and liberal disposition than they of

be replenish with all kind of fruit here be abundance of vine also yield very sweet grape whereof the jew be five hundred family make excellent wine such as I think all Africa scarce afford better in this town stand a fair castle where the governor have his abode the king of Fez assign the government of this town unto his second son be rather a meet place for the king own residence in regard of the wholefome air both in summer and winter here be the noble of the marin-famy wont to remain all summer both in respect of the holesomenes of the place and also that they may defend those region from the arabian dwell in the desert which arabian resort yearly to Tezza to the end they may there furnish themselves with victual and other necessary and bring date thither from Segelmese to exchange for come the citizen also receive of the arabian for corn great sum of money whereupon all of they in a manner grow exceed rich neither be they annoy so much with any inconvenience as with dirty street in winter I myself be acquaint in this city with a certain age sire who the townsman adore as if he have be a god he be marvellous rich both in fruit ground and other commodity which the people bestow upon he in great abundance the citizen of Fez use to come fifty mile for so far be Fez distant only to visit the say old man myself conceive some great opinion of this age sire but after I have see he I can find no such superexcellency in he save only that he delude the fond people with strange device the jurisdiction of this city be very large contain diverse mountain under it as we will forthwith declare in order of mount Matgara this mountain be very high and difficult to ascend both by reason of the vast desert and the narrow passage and it be distant from Teza almost five mile the top of this hill be most fruitful ground and full of clear fountain the inhabitant be burden with no exaction gather yearly great store of corn flax and oil they have likewise abundance of cattle and especial of goat neither do they any whit regard prince have upon a day vanquish the king of Fez in battle they carry a certain captain of Fez take prisoner unto the top of the hill where in the king own presence they put he to a most cruel and miserable death whereupon the say inhabitant have be at continual discord with the people of Fez they have almost a thousand soldier and their mountain contain about fifty village and hamlet of mount Gavata this mountain be as difficult to ascend as the former stand westward of Fez almost fifteen mile both the side and top of this mountain be very fruitful for barley and flax it be extend in length from east to west eight mile and in breadth about five mile many desert here be haunt with ape and leopard the great part of the inhabitant be linnen-weavers people they be of a frank disposition neither can they till the field adjoin to their mountain by reason of their continual dissension with the king of Fez unto who they will pay no tribute nor custom at all perhaps because of the strong situation of their mountain and for that it abound with all thing necessary for man sustenance so that albeit this mountain be besiege ten year together yet can it by no mean be win neither be it ever destitute of water for thereupon be two huge fountain which run down into the plain become the head of two river of mount Megesa this mountain also be somewhat difficult to ascend it be rough and full of wood and yield little corn but great plenty of olive the inhabitant be most part weaver for their soil yield good store of flax be in the war right valiant both on foot and horseback their face be white and that perhaps for the coldness of the mountain neither do these pay any tribute at all here also the exile of Fez and Teza have safe abode and albeit they have great store of garden and vineyard yet be they no wine-drinker soldier they have to the number of seven thousand and almost forty village of mount this mountain stand fifteen mile northward of Teza the inhabitant be rich and mighty and possess great store of horse neither do they pay any tribute at all this hill abound with plenty of corn fruit and grape and yet

this high cold and large mountain contain in length about thirty and in breadth about fifteen mile eastward it border upon the (@) of Dubdu and westward upon mount beni-iazga and it be distant from Teza almost fifty mile southward at all time of the year the top of this mountain be cover with snow the inhabitant in time past be most rich and valiant people and live in great liberty but afterward when they begin to play the tyrant the people of all the mountain adjoin have gather great force invade this mountain slay they every one and so burn and waste their town and village that unto this day it have remain void of inhabitant except only a few which detest the cruel tyranny of their parent convey themselves and all their good unto the top of the mountain where they live a abstinent and virtuous life wherefore these be spare and their posterity remain in the mountain till this present they be all learned and of honest conversation and well esteem of by the king of Fez one of they in my time be a very learned and famous old man be use by the king of Fez both about treaty of peace and in other serious affair and in this man the king repose all his confidence as if he have be some petie-god for which cause all the courtier have he in great detestation of mount beni jesseten this mountain be subject unto the governor of Dubdu be inhabit with most base and beggarly people their house be make of sea-rush and so likewise be their shoe make of such rush when they travel any journey whereby a man may conjecture the miserable estate of this people the mountain yield nought but

civility nor learning but live after a brutish manner without all discretion and humanity of mount Selelgo this woody mountain be full of pine-tree and fountain their house be not make of stone but of sea-rush so that they may easy be remove from place to place which be very commodious to the inhabitant for every spring they leave the mountain and descend into the valley from whence about the end of may they be expel by the arabian which inhabit the desert who by reason of their abundance of goat and other cattle forsake the say desert seek unto the fountain and moist place but in winter because their camel be so impatient of cold they resort unto the wood and warm region in this mountain be great store of lion leopard and ape and from the say mountain run lion leopard and ape a certain stream of water with such violence that I have see a stone of a hundred pound weight carry with the force thereof and here subu take his beginning which be the great river of all Mauritania of mount beni jasga the inhabitant of this mountain be rich and civil people it stand so near the mountain last mention that they be only separate with the foresay river and to the end they may the easy pass from one mountain to another they have make a certain strange bridge in the midst a wonderful bridge and that in manner follow on either side stand certain post through the which run a rope upon a truckle or pulley unto which rope be fasten a great basket that will contain ten person and that in such sort that so often as they will pass over to the opposite mountain they enter into the basket and draw the rope whereon it hang they be easy carry aloft in the air over the river by the help of the foresay pulley but sometime with great hazard of their life especial if the basket or the rope be wear in any place yea and the distance of place be often a occasion of great terror in this mountain there be great store of cattle but little wood it abound likewise with most excellent fine wool

of excellent and great beam of timber all the plain be so barren and dry that it will scarce bring forth any good thing at all of the plain call Camaren this plain also be environ around with woody mountain be a kind of medowe-ground for it be cover all over with most pleasant herb and grass wherefore in the summer time they use to keep their cattle here and to defend they with high and strong hedge from the fury of the lion of mount Centopozzi upon this high mountain be great store of most ancient building near unto the which there be a hole or dry pit of so great a depth that the bottom thereof can in no wise be see into this pit some mad fellow will have themselves let down by rope carry a candle or torch in their hand and beneath they say it be divide into many room and as it be chamber and last of all they come to a most large place hew out of the rock with instrument and compass about as it be with a wall in which wall be four door which lead to other more narrow place where they say that fountain of spring water be and sometime it fall out that some miserable end their life here for if their light chance to be blow out with any sudden blast of wind they can by no mean find the place where the rope hang but be there constrain to die for extreme famine it be tell i by a certain nobleman of Fez that there be ten person who be desirous to see the wonder of this pit and be prepare for the same purpose go first three of they down who when they be come to the foresay four door two of they go one way and the three go alone another way and be thus divide after they have proceed almost a quarter of a mile there come great swarm of bat fly about their light insomuch that one light be put out at length be come to the spring fountain they find there certain white bone of man and five or six candle whereof some be new and other be old and wear with long lie there but have find nothing but water in the say fountain they return back again the same way that they come and they have scarce go half way but their other light also be blow out with a sudden blast afterwards seek earnest up and down and be weary of many fall that they catch among the rock they find that there be no hope of return wherefore in this desperate case commit themselves with tear into the hand of God they vow if they (@) (@) this danger never to adventure any more they that stand at the (@) mouth be ignorant of their companion mishap expect their (@) and have stay over long at length they let down themselves by the rope and begin with light to seek their fellow make a great noise and at length find they heavy and sad but the three who be wander up and down those dark place they can by no mean find wherefore leave he they return forth of the cave and he that be leave behind hear at length a noise like the bark of little dog and shape his course towards they he find immediate four strange and as it shall seem newborn beast after which follow the * * * * * * the beast call Dabah dam be not much unlike to a shee-woolfe save that she be big wherefore he begin exceed to fear howbeit there be no danger for be about to flee the beast come towards he fawn gentle upon he with her tail and so at length after long seek he find the hole mouth with great joy and escape the danger for within a while he say that he begin to see some glimmer of light as they do which have long be in the dark but after a certain time this cave be fill with water up to the top of the mountain of raven call Cunaigel this mountain stand very near the former and be full of wood and lion here be no city nor any other place of habitation perhaps by reason of the extreme coldness of the place from this mountain run a certain little river and here be a rock of a exceed height

large plain almost two mile from a certain mountain and about twelve mile from the Mediterran sea and near unto it run a little river the historiographer of those time report that this town be in all respect build after the fashion of Rome whereupon they say it borrow the name for Ned in the arabian tongue signify like the wall of this town be as yet to be see but all the ancient building of the

small quantity of barley and panic the townsman be most base apparel and utter destitute of humanity of the town of Hunain this town be found by the african and be famous both for stately build and civil inhabitant have a little haven belong thereunto well fortify with two turret stand one on the one side and another on the other side the town-wall also be very high and beautiful especial on that side which stand next unto the sea hither do the venetian yearly bring great store of merchandise and do traffic with the merchant of Telensin for the city of Telensin be but fourteen mile from hence since the time that oran be surprise by the christian the venetian will no long frequent oran sear lest the spaniard have it in possession shall work they some mischief wherefore then they begin

likewise here be many vine run pleasant upon bower or arbour their house be pave with mat of diverse colour and their chamber and vault be curious paint and carve howbeit so soon as the inhabitant be advertise of the loss of oran they flee from Hunain and leave it void of inhabitant save that the king of Telensin maintain here a garrison of footman who give notice when any merchant ship approach their field abound with cherry peach fig olive and other fruit howbeit they reap but little commodity thereby I myself pass this way can not but bewail the extreme calamity whereinto the inhabitant of this town be fall at the same time there arrive a certain ship of a ship of great (@) Genoa which one ship bring commodity sufficient to serve Telensin for five year the ten part whereof amount to fifteen thousand ducat be pay for tribute to the king of the town of Haresgol the great and ancient town of Haresgol be build upon a rock environ on all side with the Mediterran sea save on the south where lie a way from the firm land to the town it stand northward of Telensin fourteen mile and be in time pass well store with inhabitant the governor thereof be one idris uncle unto that idris that

it remain void of inhabitant almost a hundred year after which time it be reinhabit by certain people of Granada which come thither with Mansor which Mansor repair the town to the end it may always be a place of refuge for his soldier after who decease and the death of his son Mudaffir all the soldier be expel by the tribe or people of Zanhagia and Magraoa and this second desolation of that town happen in the year of the Hegeira 410. of the great city of Telensin other wise call tremizen TElensin be a great city and the royal seat of the king but who be the first founder thereof it be uncertain howbeit most certain it be that this city be very small at the beginning and begin great to be augment at the same time when Haresgol be lay waste for then a certain family call Abdulguad bear rule it increase so exceed that in the reign of king Abu Tesfin it contain sixteen thousand family and then it be a honourable and well-governed city howbeit joseph king of Fez continual molest it and with a huge army besiege it for seven year together this joseph have build a fort upon the east side of the town put the besiege citizen to such distress that they can no long endure the extreme famine wherefore with one accord they all go unto their king beseech he to have compassion upon their want the king to make they acquaint with his dainty fare which he have to supper show they a dish of sodden horseflesh and barley and then they well perceive how little the king estate be better than the estate of the mean citizen of they all soon after the king have procure a assembly persuade his people that it be much more honourable to die in battle for the defence of their country then to live so miserable a life which word of the king so inflame all their mind to the battle that the day follow they resolve to encounter the enemy and valiant to fight it out but it fall out far better for they then they expect for the same night king joseph be slay by one of his own people which news be bring unto the citizen with (@) courage they march all out of the town easy vanquish and kill the confuse multitude of their enemy after which unexpected victory they find victual sufficient in the enemy camp to relieve their long and tedious famine about forty year after the four king of Fez of the marin-family call Abulhesen build a town within two mile westward of the city of Telensin then he besiege Telensin for thirty month together make daily and fierce assault against it and every night erect some new fort so that at length the Fessan force next unto Telensin easy enter the city and have conquer it carry home the king thereof the king of Telensin take prisoner and behead captive unto Fez where he be by the king of Fez behead and his carcase be cast forth among the filth of the city and this be the second and the great damage that Telensin sustain after the decay of the marin-family (@) begin in many place to be repair and replenish with new inhabitant insomuch that it increase to twelve thousand family here each trade and occupation have a peculiar place after the manner of Fez save that the building of Fez be somewhat more stately here be also many and beautiful temple have their mahometan priest and preacher likewise here be five college most sumptuous build some by the king of Telensin and some by the king of Fez. here also be store of goodly bath and hothouse albeit they have not such plenty of water as be at Fez. also here be very many inn build after the manner of Africa unto two of which inn the merchant of Genoa and Venice do usual resort a great part of this city be inhabit with jew who be in time past all of they exceed rich upon their head they wear a * * * * or turban dulipan to distinguish they from other citizen but in the year of the Hegeira 923 upon the death of king Abuhabdilla they be all so rob and spoil that they be now bring almost unto beggary moreover in this city there be many conduct the fountain whereof be not far from the citie-walle so that they may easy be stop by any foreign enemy the citie-wall be very high and impregnable have five great gate upon it at every one of which there be place a guard of soldier and certain receiver of the king custom on the south side of the city stand the king palace environ with most high wall and contain many other palace within it which be none of they destitute of their fountain and pleasant garden this royal palace have two gate one lead into the field and the other into the city and at this gate stand the captain of the guard the territory of Telensin contain most pleasant habitation whither the citizen in summertime use to retire themselves for beside the beautiful pasture and clear fountain there be such abundance of all kind of fruit to delight both the eye and the taste that to my remembrance I never see a more pleasant place their fig they use to dry in the sun and to keep until winter and as for almond peach melon and pome-citron they grow here in great plenty three mile eastward of this city be diverse mill upon the river of Sefsif and some other there be also not far from the city upon the mountain of Elcalha the south part of the city be inhabit by jew lawyer and notary here be also very many student and professor of diverse art which have maintenance allow they out of the five forename college the citizen be of four sort to wit some artificer some merchant other scholar and doctor and all the residue soldier the merchant be man most just trusty liberal and most zealous of the common good who for the most part exercise traffic with the negro the artificer live a secure quiet and merry life the king soldier be all of a comely personage and of great valour receive very large and liberal pay for they be monthly allow three piece of the gold-coine of Telensin which be worth three italian ducat and one second part all student before they attain to the degree of a doctor live a bare and miserable life but have attain thereunto they be make either professor or notary or priest the citizen and merchant of this city be so neat and curious in their apparel that sometime they excel the citizen of Fez in bravery the artificer wear short garment carry seldom a dulipan upon their head and content themselves with plain cap their shoe reach up to their leg of all other the soldier go worst apparel for wear a shirt or jacket with wide sleeve they cast over it a large mantle make of cotton and thus they be clad both summer and winter save that in winter they have certain jacket of leather with hood upon they such as traveller use in Italy and by this mean their head be defend from rain and from snow the scholar and student be diverse apparel according to their ability and according to the fashion of their native country the doctor judge and priest go in more sumptuous and costly attire the custom and rite observe in the king of Telensin his court a wonder it be to see how stately and magnificent the king of Telensin behave himself for no man may see he nor be admit to parley with he but only the principal noble of his court each one of who be assign to bear office according to their place and dignity in this court be sundry office and dignity and the king lieutenant be principal officer allot unto each one such place of dignity as may be correspondent to their honour and this lieutenant levy the king army and sometime conduct they against the enemy the second officer be the king chief secretary who write and record all thing pertain to the King the three be the high treasurer who be bind by (@) office to receive tribute and custom the four be the king or almoner who bestow such liberality as the king vouchsafe the five be the captain of the king guard who so often as any noble be admit to the king presence conduct the guard unto the palace-gate then be there other mean officer as namely the master of the king stable the overseer of his saddle and stirrup and his chief chamberlain who give attendance only at such time as any courtier be admit unto the king audience for at other time the king wife with certain christian captive and eunuch do perform that duty the king sometime in sumptuous and costly apparellride upon a stately stead rich trap and furnish in ride he observe not much pomp nor many ceremony neither indeed do he carry so great a train for you shall scarce see a thousand horseman in his company except perhaps in time of war when as the arabian and other people give attendance when the king go forth with a army there be not many carriage transport therein neither can you then discern the king by his apparel from any mean captain and though he conduct never so great a guard of soldier yet a man will not think how spare he be of his coin gold-money he coin of base gold then that whereof the italian money call Bislacchi be coin but it be of a great size for one piece thereof waigh a italian a passage from Europe to Acthiopia through the kingdom of tremizen ducat and one four part he stamp likewise coin of silver and of brass his dominion be but slender inhabit howbeit because the way from Europe to Aethiopia lie through his kingdom he reap much benefit by the ware that pass by especial since the time that oran be surprise by the christian at the same time Telensin itself be make tributary which be ever before a free city whereupon the king that be the author thereof be extreme hate of his subject till his die day afterwards his son that succeed he demand custom and tribute likewise for which cause be expel out of his kingdom by the people he be enforce to crave aid of the emperor Charles the five by who mean as be beforesaid he be restore unto his say kingdom when oran be subject unto the king of Telensin the region thereabout pay unto the king for yearly tribute sometime three thousand and sometime four thousand ducat the great part whereof be allow unto the king guard and to the arabian soldier I myself continue certain month in this king court have good experience of his liberality I have indeed omit many particular in the description of this court of Telensin but because they agree for the most part with those thing which we report of Fez I have here pass they over lest I shall seem too tedious unto the reader of the town of hubbed this town be build in manner of a castle stand about a mile and a half southward of Telensin it contain store of inhabitant who be for the most part dyer of cloth in this town be bury one Sadi Bu median be repute a man of singular holiness who they adore like a god ascend up to his monument by certain step here be likewise a stately college and a fair hospital to entertain stranger in both which be build by a king of Fez of the marin-family as I find record upon a certain marble stone of the town of Tefesra TThis town stand upon a plain fifteen mile from Telensin have great store of smith therein by reason of the iron-mine which be mine

here be likewise cloth-merchant and diverse other chapman which for brevity sake I pass over in silence I myself continue for some time among they find to my hindrance what cunning thief they be the king of Telensin collect yearly out of this province the sum of five and twenty thousand ducat and it contain so many most expert soldier of the town of Batha this great rich and populous town be build in my time upon a most beautiful and large plain which yield great abundance of corn the tribute which the king of Telensin have here amount to the sum of twenty thousand ducat howbeit this town be afterward destroy in that war which happen between the king and certain of his kinsman for they grow mighty by the king of Fez his aid win many town in the kingdom of Telensin and whatsoever town they think themselves not able to keep by force of arm they burn it quite down and thus they serve Batha whereof now there remain but very few ruin not far from this town run a little river on both side whereof there be many garden and field replenish with all kind of fruit moreover the foresay plain be utter destitute of inhabitant till a certain eremite a (@) (@) with his follower who they

insomuch that the whole family of this eremite and of his son contain five hundred person he be great honour by all the arabian and by the king of Telensin himself myself be once desirous to try what manner of man this eremite be and for three day I be entertain by he in the most secret place of his habitation where among other thing he show i certain book entreat of art-magique and of (@) and he endeavour by all mean to persuade i that magic be a most true and undoubted art whereby I perceive that himself be a magician albeit he never use nor regard the art except it be in invocate of God by certain name of the town of oran this great and populous town contain about six thousand family and build many year ago by the african upon the Mediterran sea shore be distant from Telensin a hundred and forty mile here may you see great store of stately building as namely of temple college hospital bathstove and inn the town be compass with most high and impregnable wall have on the one side a fair plain and on the other side diverse mountain the great part of the inhabitant be weaver and the residue live of their yearly revenue the territory of this town yield but small store of corn so that the townsman make all their bread of barley howbeit they be most courteous and friendly to all stranger this town be great frequent with merchant of Catalonia and of Genoa and one street thereof be at this present call the street of the genovese they be at perpetual enmity with the king of Telensin neither will they ever accept of any governor but one which receive the king tribute but the townsman choose one of their chief burgo-master to judge of case civil and criminal the merchant of this town maintain at their own cost certain foist and brigandine of war which commit many piracy upon the coast of Catalonia and insomuch that oran be full of christian captive afterwards don Ferdinando king of Spain encounter oran with a great armada determine to release the say christian out of captivity but he have very hard success howbeit within a few month after be oran take by the spaniard aid by the Biscayne and the cardinal of Spain he take oran for the moor issue forth with great fury upon the christian army leave the town utter destitute of soldier which the spaniard perceive begin to assail the town on the other side where be resist by none but by woman they have easy entrance whereupon the moor see the christian banner advance upon their wall they return back into the town and be there put to so great a slaughter that few of they escape thus be oran take by the spaniard in the year of Mahomet his Hegeira 916. of the town Mersalcabir this town be build in my time by the king of Telensin upon the Mediterran sea not far from oran and Mersalcabir in the moor language signify a great or large haven for I think there be not the like haven to be find in the whole world beside so that here infinite number of ship and galley may find most safe harbour in any tempestuous Mersalcabir surprise by the spaniard weather hither the venetian ship make often resort when they perceive any tempest to approach and from hence they will cause all their ware to be transport to oran in other vessel this town also be at length take by the spaniard as well as oran of the town of Mezzagran this town also be build by the african upon the Mediterran sea near unto the

from the town there be most pleasant garden but they lie now untilled and desolate their field be exceed fruitful there belong haven unto this town whereunto many merchant of Europe use to resort albeit they find not much traffic here because the (@) be so destitute of money of the town of Bresch this ancient town build by the roman upon the Mediterran sea stand many mile distant from Mustuganin it contain great store of inhabitant which be many of they weaver the people of this town use to paint a black cross upon their cheek and two other black cross upon the palm of their hand and the like custom be observe by all the inhabitant of the mountain of alger and Bugia the occasion whereof be think to be this namely that the goth when they first begin to invade these region release all those from pay of tribute as our african historiographer affirm that will embrace the christian religion but so often as any tribute be demand every man to eschew the payment thereof will not stick to profess himself a Christian wherefore it be then determine that such as be christian indeed shall be distinguish from other by the foresay cross at length the goth be expel they all revolt unto the mahometan religion howbeit this custom of paint cross remain still amongthem neither do they know the reason thereof likewise the mean sort of people in Mauritania use to make such cross upon their face as we see use by some people of Europe this town abound great with fig and the field thereof be exceed fruitful for flax and barley the townsman have continue in firm league and friendship with the people of the mountain adjoin by who favour they live a hundred year together without pay of any tribute at all but Barbarossa the Turk have win the kingdom of Telensin put they to great distress from hence they use to transport by sea great store of fig and flax unto alger Tunis and Bugia whereby they gain great store of money here also you may as yet behold diverse monument of the roman ancient building of the town of sersell this great and ancient town build by the roman upon the Mediterran sea be afterward take by the goth and last by the mahometan the wall of this town be exceed high strong and stately build and contain about eight mile in circuit in that part of the town next unto the Mediterran sea stand a most beautiful and magnificent temple build by the roman the inward part whereof consist of marble they have also in time past a impregnable for it stand upon a rock by the Mediterran sea their field be most fruitful and albeit it this town be much oppress by the goth yet the mahometan enjoy a great part thereof for the space almost of five hundred year and then after the war of Telensin it remain void of inhabitant almost three hundred year at length when Granada be win by the christian diverse moor of Granada flee hither which repair the house and a good part of the castle afterward they begin to build ship wherewith they transport their merchantable commodity into other region and they increase so by little and little that now they be grow to twelve hundred family they be subject not long since unto Barbarossa the Turk unto who they

govern by a king and be near thereunto they submit themselves unto the king of Bugia for they see that the king of Telensin can not sufficient defend they against their enemy and also that the king of Bugia may do they great damage wherefore they offer unto he a yearly tribute of their own accord and yet remain almost free from all exaction but certain year after the inhabitant of this city build for themselves galley begin to play the pirate and great to molest the foresay island whereupon king Ferdinando provide a mighty armada hope thereby to become lord of the city likewise upon a certain high rock stand opposite against the town he cause a strong fort to be build and that within gunshot of the alger become tributary to the king of Spain city albeit the city wall can not be endamage thereby wherefore the citizen immediate send ambassador into Spain to crave a league for ten year upon condition that they shall pay certain yearly tribute which request be grant by king Ferdinando and so they remain for certain month free from the danger of war but at length Barbarossa hasten to the siege of Bugia and have win one fort build by the spaniard determine to encounter another hope if he can obtain that also that he shall soon conquer the whole kingdom of Bugia howbeit all matter fall not out according to his expectation for a great part of his soldier be husbandman when they

he retire himself to the castle of Gegel be from Bugia about sixty mile distant where he remain for certain day in the mean while king Ferdinando decease the people of alger release themselves from pay any more tribute for see Barbarossa to be a most valiant warrior and a deadly enemy unto christian they send for he and choose he captain over all their force who present encounter the fort but to

king of Tunis and albeit for certain year the king of Telensin be lord thereof yet be it at length recover again by the king of Tunis who commit the government of the city unto one of his son both for the tranquillity of Bugia and also that no discord may happen among his son after his decease he leave behind he three son the elder whereof be call Habdulhaziz and unto he he bequeath the kingdom of

they have great store of fig and nut which they use to carry in certain bark unto Tunis they have in despite of the king of Bugia and Tunis continue always free from tribute for that impregnable mountain can be surprise by no siege nor encounter of the enemy at length they yield themselves unto Barbarossa who demand none other tribute of they but only the (@) of certain fruit and corn of the

upon the Mediterran sea at the foot of a certain high mountain be environ with no wall at all for the wall be raze to the ground by the goth neither do the mahometan when they have get possession build they up again howbeit this town be notable well govern and well store with inhabitant which be all man of a liberal and tractable disposition they have continual great traffic with the merchant of Genoa and do gather abundance of wax and hide their field upon the mountain be exceed fruitful and they have always so defend themselves against the prince of Tunis and Constantina that until this present they remain free from tribute from the injury of Constantina they be easy defend both in regard of the difficult mountain lie in the midway and also in respect of the great distance for Constantina stand almost a hundred and twenty mile off neither be there any city throughout the whole kingdom of Tunis either for wealth or strong situation any way comparable unto this of the town of sucaicada this ancient city build by the roman also upon the Mediterran sea and stand about thirty five mile from Constantina be waste and almost utter destroy by the goth howbeit by reason of the haven be so famous and so frequent by the merchant of Genoa the prince of Constantina cause certain fair house to be build thereabouts for the say merchant of Genoa to repose themselves and their good therein and upon a mountain not far off he build a strong (@) for the security and defence of the say merchant from all enemy whatsoever from the say haven to Constantina the high way be pave with certain black stone such as be to be see in some place of Italy be there call roman which be a manifest argument that sucaicada be build by the roman of the city of Constantina no man can deny the roman to have be founder of this city that shall consider the great strength height and antiquity of the wall and how curious they be beset and adorn with black stone this city stand upon the south side of a exceed high mountain and be environ with steep rock under which rock and within the compass whereof run the river call sufegmare so that the say deep river with the rock on either side serve in stead of a towne-ditch to Constantina the north part be compass with a wall of great thickness and there be two extreme narrow passage only to enter into the city one on the east part and another on the west the citie-gate be very large and stately the city itself contain above eight thousand family building it have very sumptuous as namely the chief temple two college three or four monastery and other such like here every trade and occupation have a several place assign and the inhabitant be right honest and valiant people here be likewise a great company of merchant whereof some sell cloth and wool other send oil and silk into Numidia and the residue exchange linnen-cloth and other ware for slave and date neither be date so cheap in any region of all Barbary beside the king of Tunis usual commit the government of Constantina unto their elder son the hard success of the king of Tunis his three son and so he that be now king of Tunis bestow Constantina upon his elder son in like sort who wage war against the arabian be slay in the first battle then fall the government of Constantina unto his second son who intemperate life be the cause of his sudden and untimely death after he succeed the three and young son who in regard of his insolent and shameless behaviour be so hate of all the citizen that some have determine to kill he whereof his father have intelligence send for he and keep he for certain year prisoner at Tunis afterwards he commit the government of Constantina to a certain renegado that of a christian become a mahometan this renegado he trust as his own brother for he have make former trial of he who for many year govern the place with great tranquillity upon the north part of the city stand a certain strong castle build at the same time when the city itself be build which castle be more strong fortify then before by one elcaied Nabil the king lieutenant and this castle great bridle both the citizen and all the border arabian who great captain it hold as prisoner and release he not till he have leave his three son for hostage at length the say elcay grow so haughty that he coin money to the great contempt of his king and sovereign who notwithstanding he endeavour by many gift and present to appease but when man perceive elcay to degenerate from his first form of government they that before love he and have he in high regard be present of another mind and utter forsake he so that lay siege unto a certain city of Numidia call Pescara he perceive some treason to be attempt against he and thereupon return forthwith to Constantina he find the citie-gate shut against he from whence he present take his journey to the king of Tunis and be by he cast into prison and not restore to liberty till he have pay a hundred thousand ducat afterwards by the king aid he be restore to his former government but when he begin to tyrannize over some of the chief citizen he again provoke the whole city unto arm who besiege forthwith the castle whereunto he flee which be such a corrasive unto elcaied his mind that within few day he die for sorrow and so the people after they be reconcile to their king will fromthencefoorth never admit any foreign governor wherefore the king of Tunis be as be aforesaid again constrain to send his own son thither the field belong to this city be exceed fertile and on either side the river which run through the plain there be most commodious garden if they be well husband also without the city stand many fair and ancient building about a mile and a half from the city stand a certain triumphal arch like unto the triumphal arch at Rome which the gross common people think to have be a castle where innumerable devil remain which they say be expel by the mahometan when they come first to inhabit Constantina from the city to the river they descend by certain stair hew out of the rock and near unto the river stand a little house so artificial cut out of the main rock that the roof pillar and wall be all of one continue substance and here the woman of Constantina wash their linen near unto the city likewise there be a certain hot bath bath of hot water disperse itself among the rock in this bath be great store of snail which the fond woman of the city call devil and when any one fall into a fever or any other disease they suppose the snail to be the author thereof and the only remedy that they can apply upon a fond and senseless (@) such a occasion be this first they kill a white hen put she into a platter with her feather on and then very solemn with waxe-candle they carry she to the Bathe and there leave she and many good fellow there be which so soon as the silly woman have set down their hen at the bath will come secret thither and convey away the hen to their own kitchen somewhat far from the city eastward there be a fountain of extreme cold water and near unto it stand a certain building of marble adorn with sundry hieroglyphical picture or emblem such as I have see at Rome and at many other place of Europe but the common people imagine that it be in time past a grammar-schoole and because both the master and scholar thereof be most vicious they be transform say they into marble the inhabitant twice every year send great store of ware into Numidia and because as they travel they be in danger of the arabian thief they hire certain turkish harquebusier for great wage to guard they the merchant of Constantina travel to Tunis pay no tribute at all but only at their departure forth of Constantina for the worth of every 100 ducat in merchandise they allow two ducat and a half of the town of mela. this town build by the roman within twelve mile of Constantina and environ with most strong wall contain almost three thousand family but at this present there be but few building by reason of the war that have happen here be greatstore of artisan the most whereof be such weaver as make coverlet in the market place there be a most clear fountain the citizen be valiant though they be of rude behaviour here be abundance not only offruit whereupon some think the name of the town to be derive but also of cattle and corn unto this town the governonr of Constantina send every year a certain judge to decide the townsman controversy and to receive the yearly tribute howbeit oftentimes the say judge be slay by the people of the ancient town of bona. this town build by the roman upon the Mediterran sea almost 120. mile more to the west be in ancient time call Hippo where s. Augustine in time past bishop of hippo. the reverend father saint Augustine be once bishop it be in process of time subdue by the goth and be afterward surprise and burn to ash by hutman the three patriarch after Mahumet and many year after they build a new town within two mile of the stone that be bring from the ruin of Bona which new town they call beld elhuneb that be the city of the fruit call Ziziphus or juiuba by reason of the great abundance of that fruit the which they use to dry in the sun and to keep till winter it contain almost three hundred family and all the house and building thereof be very base save one only temple which stand next the sea the inhabitant be all of a ingenuous disposition some of they be merchant and the residue artisan here be great store of linen-cloth weave the great part whereof be carry to Numidia the inhabitant of this town have upon a time slay their governor be so bold as to threaten the king of Tunis and they have without all doubt betray the town unto the christian have not the king of Tunis take special heed thereunto in this town be certain lewd people and most beggarly apparel which notwithstanding be high reverence by the citizen here be no fountain nor yet any water at all but rainewater only which be keep in cestern on the east side of the town stand a strong castle build by the king of Tunis where the governor of the town appoint by the king have his abode unto this town adjoin a most large plain contain in length forty and in breadth five and twenty mile very commodious it be for corn and be inhabit by certain arabian call these arabian have great store of cattle and but little money and they bring good store of butter daily unto bona. unto this town the people of Tunis of the isle of Gerbi and of Genoa use yearly to resort and to buy great abundance of corn and butter every Friday they have near unto the town wall a market which be well frequent even till night not great store of coral far from hence there be a certain place in the sea abound with great store of coral and because the townsman know not how to fish for the same the king of Tunis license certain merchant of Genoa to fish for it who in regard of the continual assault of pirate because they can not speed of their purpose they obtain leave also of the king to build a castle near unto the place but that the townsman will in no case permit say that the genovese in time past take their town by such a wile and that it be afterward recover again by the king of Tunis of the town of the town of tefa found by the african upon the side of a mountain and stand almost a hundred and fifty mile southward of Bona be in time past (@) populous and full of brave building but it have be since destroy by the arabian afterwards be replant with new inhabitant and remain free from war for certain month it be the second time destroy by the arabian last of all because it be a place commodious for corn it be inhabit the three time by certain african call Haoara and that by the aid of a certain prince brother unto he which have slay Enasir the king of Tunis his son but now all that remain of this town be utter raze by the king of Tunis of the city of Tebessa this great and strong city build by the roman near unto Numidia and be distant two hundred mile southward from the Mediterran sea be compass with a high wall make of such stone as be to be see upon the Colosso at Rome neither see I to my remembrance any such wall in all Africa or Europe and yet the house and other building be very base through part of this city run a great river and in the market and diverse other place stand certain marble pillar have epigram and sentence with latin letter engrave upon they there be also other square pillar of marble cover with roof the plain adjacent albeit very dry yet be they most fruitful for corn five mile from hence grow such abundance of wall-nut-tree as you will take they to be some thick forest near unto this town stand a certain hill full of mighty cave wherein the common people say that giant inhabit of old but it be most evident that those cave be dig by the roman at the same time when they build the city for certain it be that the stone whereof the citie-walle consist be take out of those rock the inhabitant be people of a covetous inhuman and beastly disposition neither will they vouchsafe to look upon a stranger insomuch that Eldabag a famous poet of the city of malaga in Granada have in his travel this way receive some discourtesy write in disgrace of Tebessa certain satirical verse which myself likewise have think good here to set down in the dispraise thereof within this place here be nought of any worth save worthless nut which Tebessa afford soft I mistake the marble wall be worth your earnest view so be the christall-fourds but hence be banish virtue all divine the place be hell the people worse than swine this eldabag be a most learned and elegant poet in the arabian tongue and out of measure satirical and bitter in his invective but to return to our former purpose these tebessians have always rebel against the king of Tunis and have slay all the governor that he have send wherefore the king that now be travel upon a time towards Numidia send certain ambassador into the city to know how the citizen stand affect towards he unto who they instead of God save the king make answer God save our citie-walle whereat the king wax wroth sack the city forthwith behead and hang diverse of the inhabitant and make such havoc that ever since it have remain desolate this be do in the year of the Hegeira 915. of the town call Vrbs. by the name of this town it sufficient appear that the roman be the first founder thereof situate it be upon the most beautiful plain of all Africa which by reason of the abundance of fountain be so well store with corn that from thence to Tunis which stand 190. mile northward of this place and to other region adjoin great plenty of corn be transport in this town be to be see sundry monument of the roman as namely image of marble and every where upon the wall be sentence in latin letter engrave the towne-walle be most artificial and sumptuous build this town the goth be assist by the moor surprise when as it contain the chief treasure and wealth that the roman enjoy in all Africa afterwards it remain for certain year desolate be at length notwithstanding inhabit a new yet so that it deserve rather the name of a village then of a town not far from this town run a certain river upon the which be diverse water-mill and this river take his beginning from a little hill but half a mile distant from the town all the inhabitant be either weaver or husbandman and be continual molest by the king of Tunis howbeit if the fertility of the soil the pleasantness of the place and the wholesome disposition of the air be as well know to the king as they be to myself I think very that he will leave Tunis and go and dwell in this region the arabian be well acquaint with the place for from hence they yearly transport great store of corn unto their desert of the town of this town build by the roman upon a mountain almost twenty mile distant from the Mediterran sea and about eighty mile westward of Tunis stand right in the way from Tunis to Constantina but because the name of this town be no arabian name it seem that the first name have be oftentimes corrupt and change the ancient wall of this town be as yet stand and it be a most defensible place and well furnish with all kind of necessary it be inhabit with great store of weaver and husbandman and the field thereof be so large and fruitful for all kind of grain that the people of the same region can not sufficient manure they unless they be assist by certain border arabian and yet a great part of their field lie untilled howbeit they send continual great store of corn unto Tunis the king of Tunis surcharge they with continual and grievous exaction which be the cause why their estate so mighty decay of the town call hain sammit this town be in my time found by the king of Tunis be distant almost thirty mile from it be build they say of purpose that none of the field thereabouts may lie untilled but it have since be destroy by the arabian at the commandment of the king of Tunis and now there remain a tower and certain other building only whereof some have roof upon they and other none of the town of Casba this town build by the roman upon a large plain of twelve mile compass be four and twenty mile distant from Tunis the town-wall remain strong as yet but the town itself be destroy by the arabian and the field lie untilled and all by the negligence of the king of Tunis and of the inhabitant of the same region of the castle of this castle found not many year pass by the african upon the river of Magrida and be about ten mile distant from Tunis be environ with most fruitful field near unto this town grow a certain wood great

westward of the say creek lie a most large and fruitful plain call Mater which be grievous molest by the king of Tunis and by the arabian in the fish call (@) or (@) this creek be take abundance of fish and after the month of October they catch a certain fish call by the african Giarrafa which I take to be the same that be at Rome call Laccia for then by reason of the abundance of rain that fall the salt water of the bay become somewhat fresh wherewith those fish they say be much delight very deep it be and afford good fish till the end of May but then the fish begin to decrease and to be

but other say that it be found by a queen the african chronicler Rachich be of opinion that it be build by a certain people that come from barca be expel thence by the king of Egypt wherefore I can in this place affirm any certainty as touch the founder thereof for beside that the african historiographer disagree about this matter there be none that have leave any write thereof ancient than the decay of the roman empire when as all the roman that be find in Africa be expel by the goth but afterward Tripoli of Barbaria and be take by the mahometan the inhabitant of they both go unto Carthage whither the principal roman and goth have retire themselves who endeavour by all mean to withstand the mahometan and after many skirmish the roman flee to Bona and the goth leave Carthage for a pray unto the mahometan so that it remain desolate many year after till a certain mahometan patriarch call Elmahdi bring in new colony howbeit he can scarce furnish the twenty part with inhabitant there be to be see at this day certain ruin of the citie-walle till you come to a deep and large cistern and there remain as yet also a certain conduct which convey water to the city from a mountain thirty

misery merchant shop there be not above twenty or five and twenty at the most and all the house of the town be scarce five hundred be most base and beggarly in my time here be a stately (@) and a fair college also but no student be therein the townsman though very miserable yet be they exceed proud withal and seem to pretend a great show of religion and the great part of they be either gardiner or husbandman and be grievous oppress with the king daily exaction a description of the mighty city of Tunis this city be call by the latin Tunetum and by the arabian which name they think to be corrupt because it signify nought in their language but in old time it be call Tarsis after the name of a city in Asia at the first it be a small town build by the african upon a certain lake about twelve mile distant from the Mediterran sea and upon the decay of Carthage Tunis begin to increase both in building and inhabitant for the inhabitant of Carthage be loath to remain any long in their own town fear lest some army will have be send out of Europe wherefore they repair unto Tunis and great enlarge the building thereof afterwards come thither one Hucba vtman the four mahometan patriarch who persuade the citizen that no army or garrison ought to the building of Cairaoan remain in any sea-towne wherefore he build another city call cairaoan be distant from the Mediterran sea thirty and from Tunis almost a hundred mile unto which city the army march from Tunis and in the room thereof other people be send to inhabit about a hundred and fifty year after Cairaoan be sack by the arabian the prince thereof be expel and become governor of the kingdom of Bugia howbeit he leave certain kinsman of his at Tunis who govern that city and ten year after Bugia be take by joseph the son of Tesfin who see the humanity of the foresay prince will not expel he out of his kingdom but so long as it remain to the say prince and his posterity joseph cause it to be free from all molestation afterwards Abdul Mumen king of Maroco have recover Mahdia from the christian march towards Tunis and get possession thereof also and so Tunis remain peaceable under the Tunis subject unto Abdul-Mumen and other king of Maroco dominion of the king of Maroco so long as the kingdom be govern by the say Abdul and his son joseph and their successor jacob and Mansor but after the decease of Mansor his son Mahumet Ennasir make war against the king of Spain by who be vanquish he flee to Maroco and there within few year end his life after he succeed his brother joseph who be slay by certain soldier of the king of Telensin and so upon the death of Mahumet and of his brother joseph the arabian begin to inhabit the territory of Tunis and to make often siege and assault against the city itself whereupon the governor of Tunis advertise the king of Maroco that unless present aid be send he must be coustrain to yield Tunis unto the arabian the king therefore send a certain valiant captain call Habduluahidi and bear in Seville a city of * * * * * or perhaps Andaluzia Granada with a fleet of twenty sail unto Tunis which he find half destroy by the arabian but so great be his eloquence and wisdom that he restore all thing to their former estate and receive the yearly tribute after Habduluahidi succeed his son Abu (@) who in learning and dexterity of wit excel his father this Abu build a castle upon a certain high place of the west part of Tunis which he adorn with fair building and with a most beautiful temple afterwards take his journey unto the kingdom of Tripoli and return home by the southern region he gather tribute in all those place so that after his decease he leave great treasure unto his son and after Abu succeed his son who grow so insolent that he will not be subject to the king of Maroco because he perceive his kingdom to decay at the same time also have the marin-family get possession of the kingdom of Fez and so be the family of beni Zeijen possess of the kingdom of Telensin and Granada and so while all those region be at mutual dissension the dominion of Tunis begin mighty to increase insomuch that the king of Tunis march unto Telensin and demand tribute of the inhabitant wherefore the king of Fez who as then lay siege against Maroco crave by his ambassador the king of Tunis his friendship and with great gift obtain the same then the king of Tunis return home conqueror from Telensin be receive with great triumph and be salute king of all Africa because indeed there be no prince of Africa at the same time comparable unto he wherefore he begin to ordain a royal court and to choose secretary counsellor captain and other officer appertain to a king after the very same manner that be use in the court of Maroco and from the time of this king even till our time the kingdom of Tunis have so prosper that now it be account the rich kingdom in all Africa the say king son reign after his father death enlarge the suburb of Tunis with most stately building

other corn howbeit the soil be marueluellous dry and stand in need of much water for which purpose every man have a pit whereout with a certain wheel turn about by a mule or a camel and through certain conveyance and passage make for the nonce they water all the upper part of their ground now consider I pray you what great crop of corn can be reap out of so little a field wall round about

in the merchant and most part of the citizen use for food a kind of homely pulse or pap call by they Besis be make of barley meal in form of a dumpling whereupon they pour oil or the broth of

great number of captive and satisfy his creditor for their horse and oftentimes it fall out that the merchant must stay three month together before the king return from the war but they be all that while maintain at the king charge sometime he bring not home slave enough to satisfy the merchant and otherwhiles they be constrain to await there a whole year together for the king make invasion but every year once and that at one set and appoint time of the year yea I myself meet with sundry merchant here who despair of the king payment because they have trust he a whole year determine never to

noble and famous province of Egypt border westward upon the desert of barca Numidia and Libya eastward upon the desert lie between Egypt itself and the red sea and northward upon the Mediterran sea be enclose southward with the land of the foresay people call Bugiha and with the river of Nilus it stretch in length from the (@) sea to the land of the people call Bugiha about four hundred and (@) 450. mile long fifty mile but in breadth it be very narrow so that it contain nought but a small distance between both the bank of Nilus and the barren mountain border upon the foresay desert be inhabit only in that place where Nilus be separate from the say mountain albeit towards the Mediterran sea it extend itself somewhat broad for Nilus about fower-score mile from the great city of cairo be divide into two branch one whereof (@) in his channel westward return at length into the main stream from whence he take his original and have pass about threescore mile beyond cairo it divide itself into two other branch whereof the one run to Damiata and the other to Rosetto and (@) of that which trend to Damiata issue another branch which discharge itself into a lake pass through a certain gullet or strait into the Mediterran sea upon the bank whereof stand the most ancient city of tenesse and this division of Nilus into so many stream and branch cause Egypt as I have beforesaid to be so narrow all this province be plain and be most fruitful for all kind of grain and pulse there be most pleasant and green meadow and great store of goose and other fowl the country people be of a swart and brown colour but the citizen be white garment they wear which be correced reading down to their waste and broad beneath and the sleeve likewise be straight they cover their head with a round and high habit call by the italian a dulipan their shoe be make according to the ancient fashion in summer they wear garment of particoloured cotton but in winter they use a certain garment line with cotton which they call Chebre but the chief citizen and merchant be apparel in cloth of Europe the inhabitant be of a honest cheerful and liberal disposition for their victual they use a kind of new and extreme salt cheese and sour milk also artificial congeal which fare albeit they account very dainty yet can stranger digest it and into every dish almost they put sour milk a division of Egypt since the mahometan be lord of Egypt it have be divide into three part for the region from cairo to Rosetto be call the shore of Errif and from cairo to the land of Bugiha it be call sahid that be to say the firm land but the region adjoin upon that branch of Nilus which run towards Damiata and tenesse they call by the name of Bechria or Maremma all Egypt be exceed fertile but the province of Sahid excel the two other part for abundance of corn cattle fowl and flax and maremma abound with cotton and sugar howbeit the inhabitant of marremma and Errif be far more civil than the people of Sahid because those two province lie near unto the sea and be more frequent by european barbarian and assyrian merchant but the people of Sahid have no conversation with stranger except it be with a few ethiopian of the ancient pedigree and original of the egyptian the egyptian as Moses write fetch their original from gen. 10. 6. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Mesraim be record to be the brother of Chus and the son of cham. Chibith Mesraim the son of Chus the son of cham the son of Noah and the hebrew call both the country and the inhabitant of Egypt by the name of Mesraim the arabian call Egypt itself mesre but the inhabitant Chibith and Chibith they say be the man that first take upon he the government of this region and begin first to build house thereon also the inhabitant call themselves by the same name neither be there leave any true egyptian beside a few christian which be at this present remain the residue embrace the mahometan religion have mingle themselves among the arabian and the moor this kingdom be govern many year by the egyptian themselves as namely by the king that be call Pharaoh who by their monument and admirable building seem to have be mighty prince and also by the king call Ptolomaei afterwards be subdue unto the roman empire this kingdom since the come of Christ be convert unto the christian religion under the say roman government since the decay of which empire it fall into the possession of the emperor of Constantinople who be very careful to maintain this kingdom be at length deprive thereof by the mahometan under the conduct of the son of Hasi be appoint captain general over the arabian army of Homar the second Califa or mahometan patriarch of that name who permit all man to have their own religion require nought but tribute at their hand the say captain build upon the bank of Nilus a certain town call by the arabian fustato which word signify in their language a tabernacle for when he first undertake this expedition he march through wild and desert place void of inhabitant so that his army be constrain to lie in tent the common people call this town mesre Hatichi that be to say the ancient city which notwithstanding in comparison of cairo may not unfit be call the new city and as concern the situation of this town many excellent man both christian jew and mahometan have in these our time be deceive for they think mesre to be situate in the same place where king Pharaoh in the time of Moses and king Pharaoh in the time of joseph have their abode because they suppose the town of Pharaoh to have stand in that part of Africa where Nilus stretch out one of his arm westward towards Africa and where the pyramid be as yet to be see which the holy scripture also seem to avouch in the book of genesis where it be say that the jew in Moses time be employ about the build the town of Pharaoh of the town of Aphthun which be found by Pharaoh namely in that place where Nilus trend towards Africa be about fifty mile southward of cairo and near unto the most westerly arm or branch of Nilus they allege also another probability that the town of Pharaoh be build in the same place because that at the very head or confluence of the branch of Nilus there stand a build of marvelous antiquity call the sepulchre of joseph wherein the dead body of joseph lie till it be the (@) of joseph by the jew transport unto the sepulchre of their father to be brief neither cairo nor any place near unto it can by any likelihood challenge that they be at any time inhabit by the ancient pharaos but here it be to be note that the nobility of the ancient egyptian dwell in time pass in the region of Sahid beyond cairo in the city of of Manfichmin and in other such famous city howbeit after Egypt be conquer by the roman the egyptian nobility plant themselves in the region of Errif upon the sea shore thereof namely about the city of Alexandria Rosetto and other famous town retain as yet the latin name also when the roman empire be translate into Greece the say nobility still inhabit upon the seashore the emperor lieutenant reside at Alexandria but after the mahometan get the dominion of Egypt the foresay nobility retire themselves into the inland hope thereby to reap a double commodity namely first in that they may be a mean to pacify the kingdom on both side of they and second that they may be free from the invasion of the christian whereof they shall have be in danger have they remain any long upon the sea coast of the quality and temperature of the air in Egypt the air of this country be hot and unwholesome and it rain here very seldom or never and rain be the cause of many disease in Egypt for in rainy weather some of the egyptian be subject unto dangerous rheum and fever and other unto a strange kind of swell in their privy member which swell the physician impute unto salt-cheese and beef which be the common diet of the egyptian in summer time this country be most extreme hot for a remedy of which heat they build in every town certain high tower have one door aloft and another beneath right over against the house through the top whereof the wind pass downard do somewhat cool and refresh the air otherwise in regard of the intolerable heat of the sun it be impossible for any man to live there sometime the pestilence be so extreme pestilence hot among they especial at cairo that almost every day there die twelve thousand person thereof but with the french pox I think that no the french malady most rife in Egypt other country under heaven be so molest nor that contain so many people infect therewith about the begin of April they reap their corn and have reap it they present thrash the same neither shall you see one ear of their corn stand till the twenty of May the inundation the increase of Nilus or overflow of Nilus begin about the midst of june increase afterward for the space of forty day and for the space of other forty day also decrease during which time all the city and town of Egypt be like unto land which none can come unto but by boat and barge at this time also Nilus be very fit to be sail upon with vessel of burden some whereof be so big that they will contain six thousand bushel of corn and a hundred head-cattell and in these vessel they sail only down the stream for against the stream it be impossible for they to pass empty the egyptian according to the increase of Nilus do foresee the plenty or dearth of the year follow as we will more at large declare when we come to speak of the island of Nilus over against the old city where the inundation of Nilus be measure neither be it our purpose in this place particular to describe all the city of Egypt because our african writer be of diverse opinion thereabouts for some will have Egypt to be a part of Africa but other be of a contrary mind diverse there be that affirm that part of Egypt adjoin upon the desert of Barbary Numidia and Libya to belong unto Africa some other ascribe unto Africa all those place that border upon the principal and main channel of Nilus but as for other place as namely Manf semenud damanhore Berelles tenesse and Damiata they think they not to be situate in Africa which opinion I myself also upon many and great reason take to be true wherefore my purpose be to describe none other city but such as stand near the main and principal channel of Nilus of the city of Bosiri the ancient city of Bosiri build by the egyptian upon the Mediterran sea and stand twenty mile westward from Alexandria be in time past environ with most strong wall and adorn with most beautiful and stately building at this present it be compass with many possession or ground bear date whereof no man take charge nor reap any commodity for when Alexandria be win by the christian the inhabitant abandon this city and flee towards the lake call Buchaira of the great city of Alexandria in Egypt the great city of Alexandria in Egypt found by Alexander the great not without the advice of most famous and skilful architect upon a beautiful point of land stretch into the Mediterran sea and be distant 40. mile westward of Nilus be in time past till it grow subject unto the mahometan most sumptuous and strong build as diverse and sundry author bear record afterwards this city decay many year together be deprive of the ancient renown and honour and remain in manner desolate because no merchant of Greece nor of any other part of Europe exercise any long traffic therein howbeit a certain crafty mahometan patriarch make the rude people (@) that by the prophecy of Mahumet most ample indulgence be grant unto all such as will inhabit the city or guard it for certain day and will bestow some alm for a public benefit by which wily stratagem the city be in short time (@) with foreign people which from all place resort thereunto by who be build many house near unto the citie-walle and many college of student and diverse monastery for the relief of pilgrim the city itself be four square and have four gate to enter in at one stand on the east side towards Nilus another on the south side towards the lake of Buchaira the three westward towards the desert of barca and the four towards the Mediterran sea and the haven whereat stand the searcher and customer which ransack stranger even to their very shirt for they demand custom not only for ware and merchandise but also some allowance in the hundred for all kind of money near unto the citie-walle there be two other gate also be divide asunder by a fair walk and a most impregnable castle which stand upon the strand or wharf of the port common call Marsa Bargi that be to say the port of the castle in which port ride the principal and best ship namely such as come from Venice Genoa Ragusa with other ship of Europe for hither resort the english the low dutch the Biscayne the ancient traffic of the (@) unto Alexandria portugal and man of all other nation in Europe for traffic sake howbeit this port be most usual frequent by the (@) of Appulia Sicilia and of Greece which be turkish ship all which resort into this harbour to save themselves from pirate and from tempestuous weather another port there be also call Marsa Essil Sela that be to say the port of the chain wherein the ship of Barbary namely those of Tunis and of the isle of Gerbi harbour themselves the christian be constrain to pay about the 10. part for all ware that they bring in and carry out but the mahometan pay but the 20. part and whatsoever ware be carry by land to cairo pay no custom at all and at this present that part of the city which be next unto cairo be the most famous and best furnish with merchandise bring by merchant from all place of the world the other part of this city be destitute both of civility and inhabitant for except one long street and that part of the city next the haven which be full of merchant shop and inhabit by christian the residue be void and desolate which desolation happen at that time Alexandria surprise and sack by the king of Cyprus when Lewis the four king of France be restore to liberty by the sultan the king of Cyprus with a fleet partly of venetian and partly of frenchman sudden assail Alexandria and with great slaughter surprise and (@) the same but the sultan come with a huge army to rescue Alexandria so discourage the cyprian that they burn down the house (@) and (@) themselves to flight whereupon the sultan repair the (@) and build a castle near unto the haven the city grow by (@) and little into that estate wherein it stand at this present in the city of Alexandria there be a certain high mount fashion like unto the place call testaccio at Rome whereon although it have no natural situation be find diverse earthen vessel of great antiquity upon the top of the say mount stand a turret where a certain officer be appoint to watch for such ship as direct their course towards the city who for every ship that he give notice of unto the customer receive a certain fee but if he chance to fall asleep or to be out of the way at the arrival of any ship whereof he certify not the customer he pay double for his negligence into the sultan exchequer under each house of this city there be a great vault the water of Nilus bring by a sluice into Alexandria cistern build upon mighty pillar and arch whereinto the water of Nilus at every inundation be convey under the wall of the city by a certain wonder and most artificial sluice stand without the city itself but these cistern grow sometime corrupt and foul be often in summer the occasion of many disease and infirmity this city stand in the midst of a sandy desert and be destitute of garden and vine neither be the soil round about it apt to bear corn so that their corn be bring they from place forty mile distant howbeit near the foresay sluice whereby the water of Nilus be convey into the city be certain little garden the fruit whereof be grow to ripeness be so unwholesome that they breed fever and other noisome disease among the citizen six mile westward of Alexandria among certain ancient building stand a pillar of a wonder height and thickness which the arabian call hemadussaoar that be to say the pillar of tree of this pillar there be a fable report that Ptolemey one of the king of Alexandria build it upon a extreme point of land stretch from the haven whereby to the end he may defend the city from the invasion of foreign enemy and make it invincible he place a certain steele-glasse upon the top thereof by the hide virtue of which glass as many ship as pass by while the glass be uncover shall immediate be set on fire but the say glass be break by the mahometan the secret virtue thereof vanish and the great pillar whereon it stand be remove out of the place but this be a most ridiculous narration and fit for babe to give credit unto at this present there be among the ancient inhabitant of Alexandria many christian call jacobite be all certain christian call jacobite of they artisan and merchant these jacobite have a church of their own to resort unto wherein the body of s. mark the evangelist lie in time past inter which have since be privy steal by the venetian and carry unto Venice and the say jacobite pay tribute unto the governor of cairo neither be it to be pass over in silence that in the midst of the ruinous monument of Alexandria there remain as yet a certain little house build in form of a chapel and contain a sepulchre much honour by the mahometan wherein they affirm out of the authority of their Koran that the body of the high prophet and king as they term he Alexander the great lie bury and thither resort yearly great multitude of pilgrim from foreign nation to adore and reverence the say sepulchre and oftentimes to bestow large alm thereupon other thing worthy the note I purposely pass over lest I shall seem too tedious unto the reader of the city of Bochin this ancient and small city situate in time pass upon the Mediterran sea shore eight mile eastward of Alexandria lie at this time utter desolate nought remain thereof but certain ruin of the wall it be now plant with date-tree wherewith the poor inhabitant dwell in base and solitary cottage sustain themselves near unto this city stand a tower upon a certain dangerous rock against which many ship of Syria be drive in the night do suffer shipwreck because they can in the dark find the right course to the port of Alexandria round about this city there be no field but sandy desert even to the river of Nilus of the city of Rasid call by the italian Rosetto the city of Rosetto be build by a slave of a certain mahometan patriarch and governor of Egypt upon the eastern bank of Nilus three mile from the Mediterran sea not far from the place where Nilus discharge his stream into the say sea it contain most beautiful house and palace build upon the shore of Nilus and a fair marketplace environ on all side with shop of merchant and artisan with a stately and sumptuous temple also have some gate towards the marketplace and other towards Nilus and certain commodious stair to descend into the same river near unto the temple there be a certain harbour for the safety of ship and bark of burden that carry ware unto cairo for the city be unwall resemble a village rather than a city about this city stand diverse cottage wherein they use to thrash rice with certain wooden instrument and to make ready each month three thousand bushel thereof a little far from this city there be a place like unto a village wherein great store of hackney-mule and ass be keep for traveller to ride upon unto Alexandria neither need the traveller to guide the say hackney but to let they run their ordinary course for they will go direct to the same house or inn where they ought to be leave and their pace be so good that they will from sunrising to sunset carry a man forty mile they travel always so near the seashore that sometime the wave thereof beat upon the hackney foot near unto this city be many field of date and ground which yield abundance of rice the inhabitant be of a cheerful disposition and courteous to stranger especial to such as love to spend their time in jollity and disport here be a stately bathstove also have fountain both of cold and hot water belong thereunto the John Leo be at Rasid the same time (@) Selim the great Turk pass that way like whereof for stately and commodious building be not to be find in all Egypt beside I myself be in this city when Selim the great Turk return this way from Alexandria who with his private and familiar friend behold the say bathstove seem to take great delight and contentment therein of the city call Anthius this city be build upon the eastern bank of Nilus by the roman as many latin inscription engrave in marble and remain till this present do bear sufficient record it be a beautiful and well-governed city and be furnish with man of all kind of trade and occupation the field adjacent abound with great plenty of rice corn and date the inhabitant be of a cheerful and gentle disposition and gain much by rice which they transport unto cairo of the city of Barnabal this city be found at the same time when the christian religion begin to take place in Egypt upon the eastern bank of Nilus in a most pleasant and fruitful place here be such abundance of rice that in the city there be more than four hundred house for the thrash and trim thereof but they that impose this task upon the inhabitant be man of foreign country and especial of Barbary which be so lascivious and riotous give that almost all the harlot of Egypt resort hither unto they who shave off their hair to the very bone without any cizzer or razor of the city of Thebes by who this ancient city of Thebes stand upon the western bank of Nilus shall be build our african chronicler be of sundry opinion some affirm it to be build by the egyptian some by the roman and other by the grecian because there be as yet to be see most ancient monument partly in latin partly in greek and partly in egyptian character howbeit at this present it contain but three hundred family in all be most of they very stately and sumptuous build it abound with corn rice and sugar and with certain fruit of a most excellent the fruit call mose taste call muse. it be also furnish with great store of merchant and artificer but the most part of the inhabitant be husbandman and if a man walk the street in the daytime he shall see none but trim and beautiful woman the territory adjacent abound with date-tree which grow so thick that a man can see the city till he approach nigh unto the wall here grow likewise store of grape fig and peach which be carry in great plenty unto cairo without the city there be many ancient monument as namely pillar inscription and wall of a great thickness build of excellent stone and such a number of ruinous place that this city seem in time past to have be very large of the city of Fuoa this city be distant about 45. mile southward from Rosetto be build by the egyptian on the side of Nilus next unto Asia the street there of be narrow be otherwise a well govern and populous city and abound with all necessary commodity here be likewise very fair shop of merchant and artificer albeit the inhabitant be much addict unto their ease and pleasure the woman of this town live in so great liberty that they may go whither they will all the daytime return home at night without any controlment of their husband the field adjacent abound great with date and near unto they there be a certain plain which be very apt for sugar and corn howbeit the sugar sugar cane there bring not forth perfect sugar but in steed thereof a certain kind of honey like soap which they use throughout all Egypt because there be but little other honey in the whole country of gezirat Eddeheb that be to say the golden isle over against the foresay city the river of Nilus make a isle which be situate on a

yellow scarf upon their head do publish the say increase of Nilus in every street of the city and the suburb and receive gift every day of the merchant artificer and woman so long as Nilus increase the foresay device or experiment of the increase of Nilus be this that follow if the water reach only to the fifteen cubit of the foresay pillar they hope for a fruitful year follow but if it stay between the twelve cubit and the fifteen than the increase of the year will prove but mean if it rest between the ten and twelve cubit then be it a sign that corn will be sell ten ducat the bushel but if it arise to the eighteen there be like to follow great scarcity in regard of too much moisture and if the eighteen be surmount all Egypt be in danger to be swallow up by the inundation of Nilus the officer therefore declare unto the child the height of the river and the child publish the same in all street of the city charge the people to fear God and tell they how high Nilus be increase and the

part of the wall be cast down which stop the passage of the water the river of Nilus be so swift and forcible carry through that conduct and through all other conduct and sluice in the city and the suburb that cairo at that time seem to be another Venice and then may you row over all place of the land of Egypt seven day and seven night together the foresay festival solemnity continue in cairo during which space the merchant and artificer of the city may according to the custom of the ancient egyptian consume and spend in torch perfume confection music and such like jollity all their gain

sell again the cook shop stand open very late but the shop of other artificer be shut up before ten of the clock who then walk abroad for their solace and recreation from one suburb to another the citizen in their common talk use ribald and filthy speech and that I may pass over the rest in silence it fall out often time that the wife will complain of her husband unto the judge that he do not his duty nor content she sufficient in the night season whereupon as it be permit by the mahometan law the woman be divorce and marry unto other husband among the artisan whosoever be the first inventor of any new and ingenious device be the reward of new and ingenious device clad in a garment of cloth of gold and carry with a noise of musician after he as it be in triumph from shop to shop

paper for all man to behold and if any of they chance to fall out in the street they present go to buffet and then a great number of people come flock about they to see the conflict who will not depart thence till they have reconcile they their most usual food be buffle flesh and great store of pulse when they go to dinner or supper if their family be little they lay a short and round tablecloth but if their household be great they spread a large cloth such as be use in the hall of prince among the sundry sect of religion in this city there be one sect of the moor call Chenesia and this sect live upon horseflesh so that their butcher when they can hear of any halt or lame jade buy he forthwith and set he up a fat and have kill he the say sect of Chenefia come and buy up his flesh hand-smoothe this sect be rife also among the turk the mamaluk and the people of Asia and albeit the turk may free use the food beforementioned yet do they not enure themselves thereunto in Egypt and four sever all sect of the mahometan religion permit in the city of cairo in the city of cairo there be permit four several sect differ each from other both in canon and civil law all which sect have their original from the religion of Mahumet for there be in time past four man of singular learning who by subtlety and sharpness of wit find out a way to make particular deduction out of mahumets general precept so that each of they will interpret the opinion of Mahumet according to their own fancy and will every man apply they to his own proper sense and therefore they must needs disagree much between themselves howbeit grow famous among the common people in regard of their diverse canon and precept they be the first author and founder of the say four sect any one of which whatsoever mahometan profess can renounce the same at his pleasure and embrace another sect unless he be a man of deep learning and know the reason and allegation of both part also there be in the city of cairo four principal judge who give sentence only upon matter of great importance under which four be substitute other inferior judge in evestreete of the city which decide petty contention and brabble and if the party which be at controversy chance to be of diverse sect the plaintiff may summon and convent the defendant before the judge of his street howbeit the defendant may if he will appeal from he unto the high judge of all be place over the four principal judge aforesaid and be governor of the sect call essafichia and this high judge have authority to dispense withal or to disannul the decree of the four principal and of all the other inferior judge according as he shall see cause whosoever attempt aught against the canon and precept of his own religion be severe punish by the judge of the same religion moreover albeit the priest of the foresay sect differ very much both in their form of liturgy or prayer and also in many other respect yet do they not for that diversity of ceremony hate one another neither yet do the common people of sundry sect fall to mutiny and debate but man indeed of singular learning and much read confer oftentimes together and as in private each man affirm his own sect to be the best so likewise do they confirm their opinion by subtle argument neither may any man under pain of grievous punishment reproach any of the say four ancient doctor and in very deed they all of they follow one and the same religion to wit that which be prescribe in the canon of the principal doctor of the mahometan which canon go for currant over all Africa and most part of Asia except in the dominion of the great sophi of Persia who because he reject the say canon be account by other mahometan a heretic and a schismatic but how such variety of opinion proceed from the four doctor aforesaid it be tedious and troublesome to rehearse he that be desirous to know more of this matter let he read my commentary which I have write concern the law and religion of Mahumet according to the doctrine of Malich who be a man of profound learning and be bear at Medina Talnabi where the body of Mahumet lie bury which doctrine of Malich be embrace throughout all Syria Egypt and Arabia wherewith if any man be delight let he peruse my foresay commentary and they will satisfy he to the full upon malefactor they inflict most grievous and horrible punishment especial upon such as have commit any heinous crime in the court thief they condemn to the halter a murder commit treacherous they punish in manner follow the executioner assistant take the malefactor one by the head and another by the foot and then come the chief executioner with a two-hand sword and cut his body in twain the one part whereof adjoin to the head be put into a fire full of unslaked lime and it be a a horrible kind of execution most strange and dreadful thing to consider how the same dismember and half body will remain alive in the fire for the space of a quarter of a hour speak and make answer unto the stander by but rebel or seditious person they flay alive stuff their skin with bran till they resemble man shape which be do they carry the say stuff skin upon camel back through every street of the city and there publish the crime of the party (@) than which punishment I never see a more dreadful by reason that the condemn party live so long in torment but if the tormenter once touch his navel with the knife he present yield the navel be cut be present death up the ghost which he may not do until he be command by the magistrate stand by if any be (@) for debt not have wherewithal to satisfy the same the governor of the prison pay their creditor and send they poor (@) bind in chain and accompany with certain keeper daily to beg alm from street to street all which alm redound to the governor and he allow the say prisoner very bare maintenance to live upon moreover there go cry up and down this woman (@) city certain age woman who though that which they say in the street can be understand be notwithstanding enjoin by their office to circumcise woman according to the prescript of Mahumet which ceremony be observe in Egypt and Syria of the manner of create the sultan and of the order degree and office in his court the dignity and power of the sultan be in time past exceed great but Selim the great Turk in the year of Christ if I be not deceive 1517. utter abolish the say dignity and change all the custom and law of the sultan and because it have be my hap John Leo be thrice in Egypt thrice to travel into Egypt since the say wonder alteration befall I suppose it will not be much beside my purpose if I set down in this place such particular as I know to be most certain true concern the court of the sultan unto this high dignity be wont to be choose some one of the (@) the most noble mamaluk these mamaluk be all christian at the first and steal in their childhood by the tartar out of the province of circassia which border upon the Euxin sea and be sell at Caffa a town of taurica chersonesus be bring from thence by certain merchant unto the city of cairo and be there buy by the sultan who constrain they forthwith to abjure and renounce their baptism cause they to be instruct in the arabian and turkish language and to be train up in military discipline to the end they may ascend from one degree of honour to another till at last they be advance unto the high dignity of the sultan but this custom whereby it be enact that the sultan shall be choose out of the number of such as be mamaluk and slave by their condition begin about 250. year since whenas the family of the valiant saladin who name be so terrible unto christian be support but by a few of the kindred fall to utter decay and ruin at the same time when the last king of jerusalem be determine to sack the city of cairo which also in regard of the sloth and cowardice of the mahometan Califa then reign over it intend to make itself tributary unto the same king the judge and lawyer of the city with the consent of the Califa send for a certain prince of Asia call Azedudin of the nation of the people whereof live in tent like the arabian which Azedudin together with his son saladin come with a army of fifty thousand horseman and albeit saladin be inferior in age unto his father yet in regard of his redoubt valour and singular knowledge in military affair they create he general of the field and give he free liberty to bestow all the tribute and revenue of Egypt as himself shall think expedient and so march at length against the christian he get the victory of they without any bloodshed and drive they out of jerusalem and out of all Syria then saladin return back with triumph unto cairo have a intent to usurp the government thereof where upon have slay the Califa his guard who bear principal sway over the egyptian he procure the death also of the Califa himself be thus bereave of his guard with a poison cup and then forthwith submit himself unto the patronage of the Califa of Bagdet who be the true and lawful mahometan prelate of cairo thus the jurisdiction of the Califas of cairo who have continue lord of that city by perpetual succession for the space of two hundred and thirty year surcease and return again unto the Califa of Bagdet who be the true and lawful governor thereof and so the schismatical Califas and patriarch be suppress there grow a contention between saladin and the sultan of Bagdet and saladin make himself a sovereign of cairo because the say sultan of Bagdet be in time past prince of the province of Mazandran and euarizin situate upon the river of Ganges and be bear in a certain country of Asia lay claim notwithstanding unto the dominion of cairo and intend to wage war against Saladine he be restrain by the tartar of Corasan who make invasion and inroad upon he saladin on the other side fear least the christian in revenge of the foresay injury will make a expedition into Syria and consider that his force be partly slay in the former war and partly consume by pestilence except a few which remain for the defence and safeguard of his kingdom begin to employ himself (@) buy of slave that come the original of the mamaluk from circassia who the king of Armenia by those day take and send unto cairo to be sell which slave he cause to abjure the

be account one of the most curious building in all Africa three of the say arch be demolish by Abu the last king and patriarch of Maroco to the end he may hinder the passage of jacob the first Fezsan king of the marin family but this attempt of his be to none effect as it sufficient appear by the success thereof of the two river call teseuhin the two river call by this one name spring each of they three mile asunder out of mount gugideme and run through the plain of Hascora exonerate themselves into the river call Lebich these two river as I have say have one only name be either of they

abundance of rain and melt snow of the river of subu the river of (@) begin upon mount Selilgo stand in Cheuz a province of the fezsan kingdom and it spring out of a great fountain in the midst of a vast and solitary wood and run by diverse mountain and hill from whence extend upon the plain it approach within six mile of Fez divide in sunder the region of Habat and Azgar and at length about Mahmora a place not far from Sala exonerate itself into the ocean sea into this river fall diverse other two of which namely Guarga and Aodor spring out of the mountane of Gumera and the residue from the mountain of the territory of Teza and although subu be a large river yet may it in sundry place be wade over except in winter and the spring when as it can be cross but in certain dangerous and small boat the same river also which run through the city of Fez call in the language of that country the river of pearl enter into the foresay river of subu this river of subu abound exceed with fish and especial with the foresay fish call Lasche which be there of no reckon the mouth thereof near unto the ocean sea be very deep and broad be navigable for ship of great burden as the portugal and

pass by the city of Caesar Elcabir and near unto Harais a city of azgar upon the border of Habat discharge itself into the main-ocean in the mouth of this river lie the haven of the foresay city be very difficult to enter of the river of Mulullo MVlullo arise out of mount Atlas between the city of Teza and Dubdu run through the desert and barren plain of terrest and Tafrata and at length exonerate itself into the river Muluia of the river of Mulwa the famous river of * * * * or Muluia Mulwa take his original from that part of Atlas which be situate in the region of Cheuz about five and twenty mile from the city of Gherseluin and pass over dishabit and drieplaine as also amid the desert of Angad and of garet and by the foot of mount beni jeznaten fall not far from the town of Chasasa into the Mediterran sea this river a man may wade over always in summer in the mouth whereof be catch most excellent fish of the river of za. this river spring out of mount Atlas run through a certain plain of the desert of Angad whereas the kingdom of Fez and of Telensin confine one upon a other which though it be exceed deep yet never do I see the water thereof thick or muddy it abound with fish but the inhabitant be destitute of fit instrument can not take they neither indeed be the water convenient to fish upon because they be so clear of the river of tefne the small river of tefne issue forth of the mountain border upon Numidia and continue a northerly course over the desert of Angad fall into the Mediterran sea about fifteen mile from Telensin and it affourd nought but a few small fish of the river mina this river flow out of certain mountain near unto tegdent pass through the field of the city of Batha and thence run northerly into the Mediterran sea of the river this great river fall from the mountain of and descend through barren plain to the confine of the kingdom of Telensin and tenez separate Mezagran from Mustuganin and then enter into the Mediterran sea in the mouth of which river be catch very excellent fish of diverse kind of the river Sefsaia this small river beginning from mount Atlas pass over the plain of Mettegia near unto alger and not far from the ancient town of temendefust discharge itself into the Mediterran sea of that which be call the great river this river arise out of the mountain adjoin upon the region of zeb from whence run along it disemboqu into the Mediterran sea about three mile from Bugia it overflow not but in rainy and snowy weather neither use the people of Bugia to fish therein have the sea so near they of the river call sufgmare it spring out of the mountain border upon mount and pass on through the barren field unto the territory of the city Constantina and glide along by the border thereof it receive a small river and so hold a northerly course it fall into the Mediterran sea about the same place where it separate the field of Chollo from the field of the castle call jegel of the river jadog this small river issue forth of the mountain near Constantina and stretch by the same mountain towards the east disburden itself into the sea not far from the city of bona. of the river call guadilbarbar it proceed out of certain mountain adjoin upon the field of the city call and glide by the hill and mountain it run in such a crooked channel that such as travel from Bona to Tunis must cross over it without either boat or bridge above twenty time and so at length it fall into the sea not far from the forsake port of tabraca and about fifteen mile from the city of bege of the river of Megerada the mighty river of Megerada spring forth of the mountain near unto the city Tebessa upon the border of the province of zeb continue a northerly course until at a place call gharel Meleh forty mile distant from Tunis it exonerate itself into the Mediterran sea in rainy weather it so increase that traveller because there be neither boat nor bridge be constrain to stay two or three day by the river side till it be decrease especial within six mile of Tunis and hereby you may see how the african of these time degenerate both in wit and courage from the ancient african who make the people of Rome to tremble so often at their valour of the river of it proceed from a certain southern desert and pass through sandy plain fall into the sea by a town of that very name the water thereof be salt and so hot that whosoever list to drink of it must set a river of hot and salt water it a cool for the space of a hour thus much concern the principal river of Barbary let we now proceed on to describe the numidian river of the river of Numidia and first of the river call sus. the great river of Sus flow out of the mountain of Atlas that separate the two province of Hea and Sus in sunder run southward among the say mountain stretch into the field of the foresay region and from thence trend westward unto a place call * * * * or Guartguessen Gurtuessen where it discharge itself into the main ocean in winter time it mighty overflow but in summer it be very shallow of the river of Darha this river take his original from mount Atlas about the confine of Hascora pass southward to the province call Darha from whence proceed through the desert it be disperse among certain field and pasture where because of the abundance of grass the arabian feed their camel in summer it be so dry up that a man shall not wet his shoe in go over it but it so increase in winter that it can be pass over in boat and by extreme heat of the sun the water thereof prove bitter of the river of ziz. this river spring out of the mountain of Atlas inhabit by the people call Zanaga and run along by many other mountain and by the city of Gherseluin hold on his course through the field of cheneg Metgara and reteb and enter the territory of the city segelmesse from whence it proceed by the desert castle of Sugaihila and beyond the say castle fall into a lake amid the sandy desert where no inhabitant be to be find whither notwithstanding the arabian hunter usual resort for that they find great store of game there of the river of Ghir the river of Ghir issue also forth of mount Atlas stretch southward by certain desert and then pass through the region of benigumi transform itself likewise into a lake in the very midst of the desert whereas in the begin of this my discourse entreat of the division of Africa I describe the river call by Ptolemey Niger it will here be superfluous to make any repetition thereof wherefore let we now proceed unto the description of Nilus of the mighty river of Nilus the course of this river be in very deed most admirable and the creature therein contain be exceed strange as namely sea-horse sea-oxen crocodile and other such monstrous and cruel beast as we will afterward declare which be not so hurtful either in the ancient time of the egyptian or of the roman as they be at this present but they become more dangerous ever since the mahometan be lord of Egypt Meshudi in his treatise of the memorable thing of his time report that when hume the son of Thaulon be lieutenant of Egypt under Gihsare Mutavichil the Califa of Bagdet namely in the year of the Hegeira 270. there be a certain leaden image about the bigness of a crocodile find among the ruin of a old egyptian temple which in regard of the hieroglyphic character and constellation engrave thereon serve instead of a enchantment against all crocodile but so soon as the say lieutenant cause it to be break in piece the crocodile begin then to invade man and to do much mischief howbeit what the reason shall be why the crocodile between cairo and the Mediterran sea be harmless and those above cairo towards the main land shall devour and kill so many person it go beyond my skill to determine but to return unto the description of Nilus it increase as we have say for the space of forty day begin from the seventeen of june and it continue just so long time in decrease for whereas in the high Ethiopia it rain most abundant about the begin of May the course and inundation of the water be hinder all the month of May and some part of june before it can attain unto the plain country of Egypt concern the original fountain of this river there sundry opinion concern (@) be manifold opinion and all of they uncertain some there be which affirm the same to spring out of the mountain call by themselves the mountain of the moon and other say that it begin upon certain plain situate beneath the foot of the say mountain and issue out of sundry fountain be a great way distant one from another howbeit the former of these two avouch that Nilus with great violence fall down from the say mountain into certain deep cave under the ground and come forth again at the foresay fountain both of which opinion be false for never do any man as yet see where Nilus take his original the ethiopian merchant which resort for traffic unto the city of Dancala affirm that Nilus towards the south be enlarge into such a mighty lake that no man can perceive which way the course thereof trend and that afterward be divide into manifold branch run in several channel and stretch themselves east and west it hinder the passage of traveiler so that they can compass those intricate wind and turn likewise diverse ethiopian inhabit upon the plain in manner of the arabian say that many of they travel five hundred mile southward to seek their camel which be stray away in the heat of their lust find Nilus to be in all place alike that be to say disperse into manifold arm and lake and that they discover sundry desert and barren mountain where the foresay Meshudi affirm emerald to be find which seem more probable than that which the same author affirm concern savage man which wander up and down like wild goat and feed upon the grass of the desert in manner of beast but if I record all the fable which our writer report concern Nilus I shall seem over tedious unto the reader of the strange beast and other live creature of Africa my purpose be not in this discourse to make a complete history of all the live creature in Africa but only of such as be either not to be find in Europe or such as differ in any respect from those that be find and here I intend to describe in order certain beast fish and fowl omit many thing report by Pliny who be doubtless a man of rare and singular learning notwithstanding by the default and negligence of certain author which write before he he err a little in some small matter concern Africa howbeit a little blemish ought not quite to disgrace all the beauty of a fair and amiable body of the elephant this witty beast keep in the wood and be find in great number in the forest of the land of Negro they use to go many in one company and if they chance to meet with any man they either shun he or give place unto he but if the elephant intend to hurt any man he cast he on the ground with his long snout or trunk and never cease trample upon he till he be dead and although it be a mighty and fierce beast yet be there great store of they catch by the ethiopian hunter in manner follow these hunter be acquaint with the wood and the manner of take elephant in (@) thicket where they keep use to make among the tree a round hedge of strong bough and rafte leave a space open on the one side thereof and likewise a door stand upon the plain ground which may be lift up with rope wherewith they can easy stop the say open place or passage the elephant therefore come to take his rest under the shady bough enter the hedge or enclosure where the hunter by draw the say rope and fasten the door have imprison he descend down from the tree and kill he with their arrow to the end they may get his tooth and make sale of they but if the elephant chance to break through the hedge he murder as many man as he can find in Ethiopia the high and India they have other device to take the elephant which lest I shall seem over-tedious I pass over in silence of the beast call Giraffa this beast be so savage and wild that it be a very rare matter to see any of they for they hide themselves among the desert and wood where no other beast use to come and so soon as one of they espy a man it fly forthwith though not very swift it be head like a camel ear like a ox and foot like a * * * * * * * * * * here be a word want in the original neither be any take by hunter but while they be very young of the camel camel be gentle and domestical beast and be find in Africa in great number especial in the desert of Libya Numidia and Barbaria and these the arabian esteem to be their principal possession and riches so that speak of the wealth of any of their prince or governor he have say they so many thousand camel and not so many thousand ducat moreover the arabian that possess camel live like lord and potentate in great liberty because they can remain with their camel in barren desert whither no king nor prince can bring army to subdue they these kind of beast be to be see in * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * in all part of the world which the author at that (@) know all part of the world to wit in Asia Africa and Europe and they be use in Asia by the tartar the curdian the dalemians and the turcoman in Europe the turk use they to carry burden upon as likewise do all the arabian in Africa and the inhabitant of the lybian desert yea king in their army use camel also to convey their victual and carriage howbeit the african camel far excel they of Asia for travail forty or fifty day together without any provender at all they be unlade in the evening and the african (@) be the best turn loose into the next field where they feed upon grass bramble and the bough of tree which hardness the camel of Asia can endure but when they set forth any journey they must be well pamper and full of flesh experience have teach that our camel have travail lade fifty day together without any provender have so waste first the flesh of their bunch second of their belly and last of their hip that they have scarce be able to carry the weight of 100 pound but the merchant of Asia give their camel provender half of they be lade with ware and the other half with provender and so their whole carovan of camel go forth and return home lade by which mean they keep they in good plight and reap double gain by their labour contrariwise the african merchant travail with merchandise into Ethiopia because they return empty and bring back with they thing of no great weight so soon as they arrive with their lean and gall camel in Ethiopia they sell they half for nought unto the inhabitant of the desert and they that return into Barbary or Numidia need very few camel namely for themselves to ride upon for to carry their victual their money and other light commodity of camel there be three kind whereof the first be call Hugiun be gross and of a tall stature and most fit to carry three kind of camel burden but ere four year end they grow unprofitable after which time every camel but of mean stature will carry a thousand pound of italian weight when any of the say camel be to be lade be beat upon his knee and neck with a wand he kneel down and when he feel his load sufficient he rise up again and the african use to geld their camel which they keep for the burden put but one male camel among ten female the second kind of camel call and have a double bunch be fit both to carry burden and to ride upon and these be breed only in Asia the three kind call Raguahill be camel of a slender and low stature which albeit they be unfit to carry burden yet camel of a wonder swiftness otherwise call dromedary do they so excel the two other kind in swiftness that in the space of one day they will travel a hundred mile and will so continue over the desert for eight or ten day together with very little provender and these do the principal arabian of Numidia and the moor of Libya usual ride upon when the king of Tombuto be desirous to send any message of importance unto the numidian merchant with great celerity his post or messenger ride upon one of these camel will run from Tombuto to Darha or segelmesse be nine hundred mile distant in the space of eight day at the far but such as travel must be expert in the way through the desert neither will they demand less than five hundred ducat for every journey the say camel about the begin of the spring incline to their lust and venery do not only hurt one another but also will deadly wound such person as have do they any injury in time past not forget light and easy stripe and whosoever they lie hold on with their tooth they lift he up on high and cast he down again trample upon he with their foot and in this mad mood they continue forty day together neither be they so patient of hunger as of thirst for they will abstain from drink without any inconvenience for fifteen day together the camel great abstinence from drink and if their guide water they once in three day they do they great hurt for they be not usual water but once in five or nine day or at a urgent necessity once in fifteen day moreover the say camel be of a gentle disposition and be endue as it be with a kind of human reason for when as between Ethiopia and Barbary they have a day journey to travel more than their wont their master can drive they on be so tire with whip but be fain to sing certain song unto they wherewith be exceed delight they perform their journey with such swiftness that their say master be scarce able to follow they at my be in cairo I see a camel dance which art of dance how he how the camel of (@) learn to dance learn of his master I will here in few word report they take a young camel and put he for half a hour together into a place like a bathstove prepare for the same purpose the floor whereof be with fire then play they without upon a drum whereat the camel not so much in regard of the noise as of the hot pavement which offend his foot lift up one leg after another in manner of a dance and have be accustom unto this exercise for the space of a year or ten month they then present he unto the public view of the people when as hear the noise of a drum and remember the time when he tread upon the hot floor he present fall a dance and leap and so use be turn into a kind of nature he perpetual observe the same custom I can here report other matter concern the same beast which for brevity sake I omit of the horse of Barbary this name be give unto the Barbary horse throughout Italy and all Europe because they come forth of Barbary and be a kind of horse that be breed in those region but they which so think be deceive for the horse of Barbary differ not in any respect from other horse but horse of the same swiftness and agility be in the arabian tongue call throughout all Egypt Syria Asia Arabia Felix and by the name of arabian horse and the historiographer affirm that this kind of wild horse range up and down the arabian desert and be break and manage by the arabian ever since the time of Ishmael have so exceed multiply and increase that they have replenish the most part of Africa which opinion savour of truth for even at this present there be great store of wild horse find both in the african and arabian desert and I myself see in the numidian desert a wild colt of a white colour and (@) a curl main the most certain trial of these horse be when they can overtake the beast call lant or the ostrich in a race which if they be able to perform they be esteem worth a thousand ducat or a hundred camel howbeit very few of these horse be bring up in Barbary but the arabian that inhabit the desert and the people of Libya bring up great number of they use they not for travel or warfare but only for hunt neither do they give they any other meat but the milk of morse feed with camel milk camel and that twice every day and night to the end they may keep they nimble lively and of spare flesh and in the time of grass they suffer they to feed in pasture but then they ride not upon they but those that the prince of Barbary bring up be not of such swiftness but be feed with provender be more beautiful and comely to the eye and these they use upon a urgent necessity when they will escape the danger of their enemy of the wild horse the wild horse be one of those beast that come seldom in sight the arabian of the desert take the wild horse and eat he say that the young the horse be the sweet be his flesh but he will hardly be take either with horse or dog in the water where this beast keep they lay certain snare cover they over with sand wherein his foot be catch he be entangle and slay of the beast call lant or this beast in shape resemble a ox save that he have small leg and comely horn his hair be white and his hoof be as black as (@) and he be so exceed swift that no beast can overtake he but only the Barbary horse as be beforesaid he be easily catch in summer then in winter because that in regard of the extreme fret heat of the sand his hoof be then strain and set awry by which mean his swiftness be abate like as the (@) of stags and roe-deer of the hide of this beast target make of a skin be make shield and target of great defence which will not be pierce but only with the forcible shot of a bullet but they be sell at a extreme price of the wild ox it resemble the tame ox save that it be less in stature be of a gray or ashe-colour and of great swiftness it haunt either the desert or the confine of the desert and the flesh thereof they say be very savoury of the wild ass this beast also be find either in the desert or upon the border thereof be of a ash-colour in swiftness they be surpass only by the Barbary horse and when they see a man they bray out a loud kick and wince with their heel and stand stone-still till one approach so near they that he may touch they with his hand and then they betake themselves to flight by the arabian of the desert they be catch with snare and other engine they go in company either when they feed or water themselves their flesh be hot and unsavoury and have a wild taste but be set a cool two day after it be sodden it become very savoury and pleasant of the ox upon the mountain of Africa all the ox upon the mountain of Africa be tame cattle be of so mean a stature that in comparison of other ox they seem to be but heifer of two year old but the mountainer use they to the plough say that they be strong and will endure much labour of the beast call adimmain it be a tame beast be shape like a ram and of the stature of a ass and have long and dangle ear the libyan use these beast instead of kine and make of their milk great store of cheese and butter they have some wool though it be but short I myself upon a time be merry dispose ride a quarter of a mile upon the back of one of these beast very many of they there be in the desert of Libya and but few in other place and it be a rare matter to see one of they in the numidian field of the african ram there be no difference between these ram of Africa and other save only in their tail which be of a great thickness be by so much the grosser by how much they be more fat so that some of their tail weigh ten and other twenty pound a piece and they become fat of their own natural inclination but in Egypt there be diverse that feed they fat with bran and barley until their tail grow so big that they can remove themselves from place to place insomuch that those which take charge of they be fain to bind little cart under their tail to the end they may have strength to walk I myself see at a city in Egypt call Asiot and stand upon Nilus about a hundred and fifty mile from cairo one of the say ram tail that weigh fower-score pound and other affirm that they have see one of those tail of a hundred and fifty pound weight all the fat therefore of this beast consist in his tail neither be there any of they to be find but only in Tunis and in Egypt of the Lyon the (@) be a most fierce and cruel beast be hurtful unto all other beast and excel they both in strength courage and cruelty neither be he only a devourer of beast but of man also in some place one lion will bold encounter two hundred horseman they range without all fear among the flock and drove of cattle and whatsoever beast they can lay hold on they carry it into the next wood unto their whelp yea some lion there be as I have before say that will vanquish and kill five or six horseman in one company howbeit such lion as live upon the cold mountain be not so outrageous and cruel but the hot the place be where they keep the more ravenous and bold be they as namely upon the frontier of Temesna and of the kingdom of Fez in the desert of Angad near Telensin and between the city of Bona and Tunis all which be account the most famous and fierce lion in all Africa in the spring while they be give to lust and venery they have most fierce and bloody conflict one with a other eight or twelve lion follow after one lioness I have hear many both man and woman report that if a woman chance to meet with a lion and show he her privy part he will with cry and roar cast his eye upon the ground and so depart believe it they that list but this I be well assure of that whatsoever a lion get in his paw though it be a camel he will carry it away I myself be twice in great hazard to have be devour of lion but by the goodness of God I escape they of the leopard these beast live in the wood of Barbary will not for all their great strength and cruelty hurt any man unless it be very seldom when as they meet with a man in a narrow passage and can shun he or when they be check and provoke unto fury for than they will fly upon a man lay hold upon his visage with their talent and pluck off so much flesh as they can catch insomuch that sometime they will crush his brain in piece they invade not any flock or drove of tame cattle but be at deadly feud with dog who they will kill and devour the mountainer of the region of hunt they on horseback stop all passage where they may escape the leopard range up and down and find every place so beset with horseman that he can get away wind and turn himself on all side and so become a fit mark for the hunter to discharge their dart and arrow upon but if the leopard chance to escape that man that let he pass be bind by a usual custom to invite the residue of the hunter unto a banquet of the beast call dabuh this beast call by the arabian dabuh and by the african jesef in bigness and shape resemble a wolf save that his leg and foot be like to the leg and foot of a man it be not hurtful unto any other beast but will rake the carkeise of man out of their grave and will devour they be otherwise a abject and silly creature the hunter be acquaint with his den come before it sing and play upon a drum by which melody be allure forth his leg be entrap in a strong rope and so he be draw out and slay of the (@) cat. these cat be natural wild and be find in the wood of Ethiopia the merchant take their young whelp or kitte feed they the manner of gather civet with milk bran and flesh and keep they in cage or grate but their odoriferous excrement which be nought else but their sweat they gather twice or thrice every day in manner follow first they drive they up and down the grate with a wand till they sweat and then they take the say sweat from under their flank their shoulder their neck and their tail which excrement of sweat be common call civet of the ape of ape there be diverse and sundry kind those which have tail be call in the african tongue monne and those which have none they be find in the wood of Mauritania and upon the mountain of Bugia and Constantina they represent the shape of man not only in their foot and hand but also in their visage and be natural endue with wonder wit and subtlety they live upon grass and corn and go in great company to feed in the corn field and one of their company which stand centinel or keep watch and ward upon the border when he espy the husbandman come he cry out and give as it be a alarm to his fellow who every one of they flee immediate into the next wood and betake themselves to the tree the she ape carry their whelp upon their shoulder and will leap with they in that sort from one tree to another such of they as be teach will do wonder feat but they be angry and curse notwithstanding they will soon be appease of the coney of Africa there be great store of wild coney in Mauritania and upon the mountain of Gumera which albeit they be account wild yet in my opinion they seem tame for their flesh differ neither in taste nor colour from the flesh of tame coney of the strange fish of Africa and first of the fish call (@) the fish call Ambara be of a monstrous shape and bigness be never see but when it be cast up dead upon the seashore and some of these fish there be which contain twenty five cubit in length the head of this fish be as hard as a stone the inhabitant of the ocean sea coast affirm that this fish cast forth amber but whether the say amber amber be the or the excrement thereof they can well determine howsoever it be the fish may in regard of the hugeness be call a whale of the sea-horse this creature be common find in the river of Niger and Nilus in shape it resemble a horse and in stature a ass but it be altogether destitute of hair it live both in the water and upon the land and swim to the shore in the night season bark and boat lade with ware and sail down the river of Niger be great endanger by this sea-horse for oftentimes he overwhelm and sink they of the sea-oxe the sea-oxe be cover with a exceed hard skin be shape in all respect like unto the land-oxe save that in bigness it exceed not a calf of six month old it be find in both the river of Niger and of Nilus and be take by fisher be keep a long time alive out of the water I myself see one at cairo lead up and down by the neck in a chain which they say be take at the city of Asna stand upon the bank of Nilus about four hundred mile from cairo of the tortoise this might benumbred among the land-creature because it live for the most part in the desert in the libyan desert be find (@) many as big as a ton and Bicri the cosmographer in his book of the region and journey of Africa report that a certain man be weary of travel ascend to his think upon a high stone lie in the desert to the end he may free himself from the danger of serpent and venomous beast who have sleep sound thereupon all night find himself in the morning remove three mile from the place where he first lie down and thereby understand that it be not a stone but a tortoise whereon he repose himself which lie still all the day long creep for food in the night-season but so slow that her pace can hardly be perceive I myself have see some of these tortoise as big as a barrel but never any so huge as the last before mention the flesh of a tortoise not above seven a medicine for the leprosy year old be eat seven day together be say to be a perfect medicine against the leprosy of the crocodile this cruel and noisome beast common frequent the river of Niger and Nilus and contain in length twelve cubit and above the tail thereof be as long as the whole body beside albeit there be the craft of the crocodile in take both man and beast but few of so huge a bigness it go upon four foot like a lizard neither be it above a and a half high the tail of this beast be full of knot and the skin thereof be so exceed hard that no crossbow will enter it some prey upon fish only but other upon beast and man which lurk about the bank of the river do crafty lay wait for man and beast that come the same way about who sudden wind their tail they draw they into the water and there devour they howbeit some of they be not so cruel by nature for if they be no inhabitant can live near unto the river of Nilus and Niger in eat they move the upper jaw only their neither jaw be join unto their breastbone not many year since pass up the river of Nilus towards the city of Cana stand in the upper part of Egypt four hundred mile from cairo on a certain night while we be in the midst of our journey the moon be overshadow with cloud the mariner and passenger all fast a sleep and the bark under sail I myself study by candlelight in my cabin be call upon by a devout old man in the bark who bestow the same night in watch and prayer and say unto i call I pray you some of your company who may help i to draw up this piece of wood float upon the water which will serve to morrow for the dress of our dinner myself sir quoth I will come and help you rather than wake any of our company in the dead of the night nay quoth the old man I will try whether I be able to draw it up alone or no. and so when the bark be near unto the wood as he suppose hold a rope in his hand to cast into the water he be sudden entangle with a crocodile long tail and be in a moment draw under the water whereupon I make a shout all the people in the bark arise and strike sail we stay for the space of a hour diverse in the mean time leap into the water to seek the man but altogether in vain and therefore all of they affirm that he be catch by a crocodile as we sail far we see great number of crocodile upon the bank of island in the midst of Nilus lie beak they in the sun with their jaw wide open whereinto certain little bird about the bigness of a thrush enter come fly forth again present after the occasion whereof be tell i to be this the crocodile little bird fly into the crocodile mouth to pick worm from between their tooth by reason of their continual devour of beast and fish have certain piece of flesh stick fast between their (@) tooth which flesh be (@) breed a kind of (@) wherewith they be cruel torment wherefore the say bird fly about and see the worm enter into the crocodile jaw to satisfy their hunger therewith but the crocodile perceive himself free from the worm of his tooth offer to shut his mouth and to devour the little bird that do he so good a turn but be hinder from his ungrateful attempt by a prick which grow upon the bird head he be constrain to open his jaw and to let she depart the she crocodile lay egg upon the shore cover they with sand and so soon as the young crocodile be hatch they crawl into the river those crocodile that forsake the river and haunt the desert become venomous but such as continue in Nilus be destitute of poison in Egypt there be many that eat the flesh of the crocodile and affirm it to be of a excellent taste his lord or grease be sell very dear at cairo the manner of take the crocodile and be say to be very medicinable for old and canker wound they take the crocodile in manner follow the fisher bind a strong and large rope unto some tree or post stand for the nonce upon the bank of Nilus fasten unto the end thereof a iron hook of a long and about the thickness of a man finger and upon the hook they hang a ram or a goat by the bleat noise whereof the crocodile be allure come forth of the water and swallow up both the bait and the hook wherewithal feel himself inward wound he struggle mighty and beat the ground the fisher in the mean time pull and slack the rope till the crocodile fall down vanquish and dead then they thrusthim in with certain dart and javelin under the shoulder and flank where his skin be most tender and so make a quick dispatch of he his back be so hard and thick that a harquebuse or caliver will scarce pierce it of these beast I see above three hundred head place upon the wall of Cana with their jaw wide open be of so monstrous and incredible a bigness that they be sufficient to have swallow up a whole cow at once and their tooth be great and sharp the egyptian fisher use to cut off the head of crocodile and to set they upon the wall of their city and so do hunter use the head of wild beast of the dragon in the cave of Atlas be find many huge and monstrous dragon which be heavy and of a slow motion because the midst of their body be gross but their neck and tail be slender they be most venomous creature insomuch that whosoever be bite or touch by they his flesh present wax soft and weak neither can he by any mean escape death of the Hydra this serpent be short in proportion of body and have a slender tail and neck live in the libyan desert the poison thereof be most deadly so that if a man be bite by this beast he have none other remedy but to cut off the wound part before the poison disperse itself into the other member of the creature call dub. this creature live also in the desert resemble in shape a Lizzard save that it be somewhat big and contain in length a and in breadth four finger it drink no water at all and if a man pour any water into the mouth thereof it present die it lay egg in manner of a tortoise and be destitute of poison the arabian take it in the desert and I myself cut the throat of one which I take but it bleed a very little be flay and roast it taste somewhat like a frog in swiftness it be comparable to a Lizzard and be hunt if it chance to thrust the head into a hole it can by no force be draw out except the hole be dig wide by the hunter have be slay three day together and then be put to the fire it stir itself as if it be new dead of the guaral this beast be like unto the former save that it be somewhat big and have poison both in the head and tail which two part be cut off the arabian will eat it notwithstanding it be of a deform shape and ugly colour in which respect I loathe always to eat the flesh thereof of the chameleon the chameleon be of the shape and bigness of a lizzard be a deform crooked and lean creature have a long and slender tail like a mouse and be of a slow pace it be nourish by the element of air and the sunbeam at the rise whereof it gape and turn itself up and down it change the colour according to the variety of place where it come be sometime black and sometime green as I myself have see it it be at great enmity with venomous serpent for when it how the chameleon kill the serpent see any lie sleep under a tree it present climb up the same tree and look down upon the serpent head it void out of the mouth as it be a long thread of spittle with a round drop like a pearl hang at the end which drop fall wrong the chameleon change his place till it may light direct upon the serpent head by the virtue wherofhe present die our african writer have report many thing concern the property and secret quality of this beast which at this present I do not well remember of the ostrich somewhat we will here say concern the strange bird and fowl of Africa and first of the ostrich which in shape resemble a goose but that the neck and leg be somewhat long so that some of they exceed the length of two cubit the body of this bird be large and the wing thereof be full of great feather both white and black which wing and feather be unfit to fly withal do help the ostrich with the motion of her train to run a swift pace this fowl live in dry desert and lay to the number of ten or twelve egg in the sand which be about the bigness of great bullet weigh fifteen pound a piece but the ostrich be of so weak a memory that she present forget the place where her egg be lay and afterward the same or some other ostrichehenne find the say egg by chance hatch and fosterech they as if they be certain her own the chicken be no soon creep out of the shell but they prowl up and down the desert for their food and before their feather be grow they be so swift that a man shall hardly overtake they the ostrich be a silly and deaf creature feed upon any thing which it find be it as hard and undigestable as iron the flesh especial of their leg be of a slimy and strong taste and yet the numidian use it for food for they take young ostrich and set they up a fat the ostrich wander up and down the desert in orderly troop so that a far off a man will take they to be so many horseman which illusion have often dismay whole carovans be in Numidia I myself (@) of the ostrich flesh which seem to have not (@) a unsavoury taste of the eagle of eagle there be diverse kind according to their natural property the proportion of their body or the diversity of their colour and the great kind of eagle be call in the arabian tongue Nesir the african teach their eagle to pray upon fox and wolf which in their encounter (@) upon the head of the say beast with their bill and upon the back with their talent to avoid the danger of bite but if the beast turn his belly upward the eagle will not forsake he till she have either a strange narration peck out his eye or slay he many of our african writer affirm that the male eagle oftentimes engender with a (@) woof beget a dragon have the beak and wing of a bird a serpent tail the foot of a wolf and a skin speckle and party colour like the skin of a serpent neither can it open the eyelid and it live in cave this monster albeit myself have not see yet the common report over all Africa affirm that there be such a one of the foul call Nesir this be the great foul in all Africa and exceed a crane in bigness though the bill neck and leg be somewhat short in fly this bird mount up so high into the air that it can be (@) but at the sight of a dead carcase it will immediate descend this bird live a long time and I myself have see many of they unfeathered by reason of extreme old age wherefore have cast all their feather they return unto their nest as if they be new hatch and be there nourish by the young bird of the same kind the italian call it by the name of a vulture but I think it to be of another kind they nestle upon high rock and upon the top of wild and desert mountain especial upon mount Atlas and they be take by such as be acquaint with those place of the bird call Bezi or the hawk this bird call in latin be very common in Africa but the best african hawk be white be take upon certain mountain of the numidian desert and with these hawk they pursue the crane of these hawk there be diverse kind some be use to fly at partridge and quail and other at the hare of the bat. these ugly nightbird be rife all the world over but in certain cave of Atlas there be many of they find as big and big than dove especial in their wing which albeit myself never see yet have I hear of they by diverse person of the parrot or poppiniay these parrot be common find in the wood of Ethiopia but the better sort of they and such as will imitate man voice more perfect be the green one parrot there be as big as a dove of diverse colour some red some black and some ash-coloured which albeit they can so fit express man speech yet have they most sweet and shrill voice of the locust of locust there be sometime see such monstrous swarm in Africa that in fly they intercept the sunbeam like a thick cloud they devour tree leaf fruit and all green thing grow out of the earth at their departure they leave egg behind they whereof other young locust breed which in the place where they be leave will eat and consume all thing even to the very bark of tree procure thereby extreme dearth of corn especial in Mauritania howbeit the inhabitant of Arabia and of Libya esteem the come of these locust as a fortunate bode for seethe or dry they in the sun they bruise they to powder and so eat they and now let thus much suffice to have speak of the african beast fowl fish serpent etc. which be either not to be find in Europe or such as differ from creature of the same kind there wherefore have once brief entreat in the chapter follow of certain mineral tree and fruit of Africa I purpose then to conclude this my present discourse whereas my author John Leo intreat but brief of these locust which God uf as a most sharp scourge between time to discple all the nation of Africa I think it not unmeet to add two other relation or testimony of the same argument the one be reverend in regard of the author antiquity and the other credible and to be accept for that the reporter himself be a most diligent and faithful eyewitness of the same the first testimony take out of the 11. chap. of the five book of Paulus orosius of a huge and pernicious company of locust in Africa which after they have waste the country be drown in the sea and cast up dead on the shore breed a most wonder pestilence both of man and beast in the consulship of Marcus Plautius hypsaeus and Marcus Fuluius Flaccus Africa scarce breathe from bloody war a horrible and extraordinary destruction ensue for whereas now throughout all Africa infinite multitude of locust be gather together and have not only quite devour the corn on the ground and consume the herb with part of their root and the leaf and tender bough of the tree but have gnaw also the bitter bark and dry wood be with a violent and sudden wind hoist aloft in mighty swarm and carry a long time in the air they be at length drown in the african sea who loathsome and putrify carcase be by the wave of the sea cast up in huge heap far and wide along the shore breed a incredible stink and infectious smell whereupon follow so general a pestilence of all live creature that the corrupt dead body of fowl cattle and wild beast dissolve by the contagion of the air augment the fury of the plague but how great and extraordinary a death of man there be I can but tremble to report for in Numidia where micipsa be then king die fourscore thousand person and upon the sea-coast next adjoiningto Carthage and Utica above two hundred thousand be say to have perish yea in the city of Utica itself be by this mean sweep from the face of the earth thirty thousand brave soldier which be appoint to be the garrison for all Africa and the destruction be so sudden and violent as they report that out of one gate of Utica in one and the same day be carry above fifteen hundred dead corpse of those lusty young gallant so that by the grace and favour of almighty God through who mercy and in confidence of who I do speak these thing I may bold affirm that albeit sometime in our day the locust in diverse part and usual do some damage which be tolerable yet never befall there in the time of the christian so insupportable a mischief as that this scourge of locust which be alive be by no mean (@) shall after their death prove far more pernicious and which also live the fruit of the earth will have be quite devour it have be much better they have never die to the plague and destruction of all earthly creature hitherto Paulus orosius the second testimony take out of the 32. and 33. chapter of the ethiopian history of Francis Aluarez which for the satisfaction of every reader I have put down with all particularity and circumstance of the great multitude of locust and the infinite damage that they procure in the dominion of Prete janni chap. 32. in this quarter and throughout all the dominion of Prete janni there be a horrible and great plague to wit a innumerable company of locust which eat and consume the corn and tree of fruit and so great be the number of these creature as it be not credible for with the multitude of they the earth be cover and the air so endeavour as one may hardly discern the sun and further I affirm that it be a thing most strange to he who (@) not see it and if the damage they perform be general through all the province and kingdom of Prete janni his people will die with famine neither can man possible there inhabit but one year they destroy one province and the next year another (@) as if for example they waste the kingdom of Portugal or Castille this (@) a other year they be in the quarter of Lenteio a other in estremadura a other in Beira or between the river Dorus and minius a other on the mountain a other in old Castilia Arragon or Andaluzia and otherwhiles in two or three of these province at once and wheresoever they come the earth be more waste and destroy by they then if it have be all over consume with a fire these locust be as big as the great grasshopper have yellow wing their come into the country be know a day before not for that we can see they but we know it by the sun who be yellow of colour this be a sign that they draw near to the country as also the earth look yellow by reason of the light which reflect from their wing whereupon the people in a manner become present half dead say we be undo for the Ambati that be to say the locust be come and I can not forbear to set down that which I see three sundry time and first in Barua where we have now be for the space of three year and here we often hear it say that such a country and such a realm be destroy by the locust and be in this province we see the sun and the upper part of the earth look all yellow the people be in a manner half dead for sorrow but the day follow it be a incredible thing to see the number of these creature that come which to our judgement cover four and twenty mile of land as afterward we be inform when this scourge and plague be come the priest of that place come and seek i out request i to give they some remedy for the drive of they away and I answer that I can tell they nothing but only that they shall devout pray unto God that he will drive they out of the country and so I go to the ambassador and tell he that it will be very good to go on procession beseech God that he will deliver the country who peradventure in his great mercy may hear we this like the ambassador very well and the day follow we gather together the people of the land with all the priest and take the consecrate stone and the cross according to their custom all we Portugal sing the litany and appoint those of the land that they shall lift up their voice aloud as we do say in their language Zio Christos which be as much to say as lord God have mercy upon we and with this manner of invocation we go over a piece of ground where there be field of wheat for the space of a mile even to a little hill and here I a strange (@) cause many of these locust to be take pronounce over they a certain conjuration which I have about i in writing have make it that night request admonish and excommunicate they enjoin they within the space of three hour to depart towards the sea or the land of the moor or the desert mountain and to let the christian alone and they not perform this I summon and charge the bird of heaven the beast of the earth and all sort of tempest to scatter destroy and eat up their body and to this effect I take a quantity of locust make this admonition to they present in the behalf likewise of they absent and so give they liberty I suffer they to depart it please God to hear we sinner for in our return home they come so thick upon our back as it seem that they will have break our head or shoulder so hard they strike against we as if we have be beat with stone and cudgel and in this sort they go towards the sea the man woman and child remain at home be get upon the top or terrace of their house give God thanks that the locust be go away some afore and other follow in the mean while towards the sea there arise a great cloud with thunder which meet they full in the tooth and continue for the space of three hour with much rain and tempest that fill all the river and when the rain cease it be a fearful thing to behold the dead locust which be more than two * * * * or fathom yard in height upon the bank of the river and in some river there be mighty heap of they so that the morning follow there be not one of they find alive upon the earth the people of the place adjoin hear this come in great number to inquire how this matter be effect many of the inhabitant say these portugal be holy man and by the power of their god they have kill and drive away the locust other say especial the priest and friar of those place near about that we be witch and by power of enchantment have drive away the say creature and that for this cause we fear neither lion nor any other wild beast three day after this effect there come unto we a xuum that be a captain of a place call Coiberia with man priest and friar to request we that we will for the love of God help they say that they be in a manner destroy by the locust and that place be a day journey off towards the sea they come to we about evening and at the same instant I and four other portugal depart away with they we go all night and come thither a hour within day where we find that all those of the country with many of the other place adjoin be assemble together for they be also molest by the locust and assoon as we be come we go our procession round about the land which be seat upon a high hill from whence we may discern many country and place all yellow by reason of the multitude of locust such invocatious and ceremony be end as we perform in the other place we go to dinner and the man that be borderer request we to go with they promise we great reward it please god that as soon as we have dine we see all the earth so clear that there be not so much as one locust to be see the people see this and not be satisfy with the favour and grace receive they request we to go and bless their possession for they be yet afraid lest the locust will return and so we depart of the damage we see do in another province by the locust in two sundry place chap. 33. a other time also we see the locust be in a town call Abuguna Prete janni send we to this town which be in the kingdom of Angote and distant from Barua where we continue thirty day journey to the end that there we may be furnish with victual be come (@) I go with the ambassador Zagazabo who come into Portugal and five genovese towards a certain town and a mountain call aguoan and we travail five day through place all desert and destroy which place be sow with Maiz have stalk as great as those prop which we use about our vine and we may see they all break and tread underfoot as if there have be a tempest and this have the locust do their wheat barley and Taffo be so eat as it seem they never have be either till or sow the tree be without leaf and their bark all gnaw and eat and there be not so much as a spire of grass for they have devour every thing and if we have not be advise and foresee the same for when we depart we lade our mule with victual we and our beast have die together for hunger the country be cover all over with winglesse locust and they say that those be the seed of they which have devour all and that when they have get wing they will go seek out the rest the number of these be so great as I be loath to report because I shall not perhaps be credit but this I may well affirm that I see man woman and child sit as it be amaze among these locust and I say unto they why sit you thus half dead and do not kill these creature and so revenge yourselves of the wrong that their father and mother have do you or at least that those which you kill may be able to do you no more harm they answer that they have not the hart to withstand the scourge of God which he have send upon they for their sin and all the people of this place depart hence so that we find the way full of man and woman on foot with their child in their arm and upon their head go into other country where they may find victual and it be great pity to behold they we be in the say province of Abuguna in a place call aquate there come such swarm of locust as be innumerable which one day begin to fall upon the ground about nine of the clock in the morning and cease not while night where they light there they stay and then the next day in the morning go away so that at three of the clock in the afternoon there be not one of they to be see and in this short time they leave the tree utter destitute of leaf on the same day and hour there come a other squadron and these leave neither tree nor bough ungnawen and eat and thus do they for five day one after a other they say that those be young one which go to seek their father and they do the like as those we see without wing the space that these locust take up be nine mile for which circuit there remain neither bark nor leaf upon the tree and the country look not as though it have be burn but as though it have snow thereupon and this be by reason of the whiteness of the tree which be peel bare by the locust and the earth be all sweep clean it be God will that the harvest be already in we can not understand which way they afterward go because they come from the sea ward out of the kingdom of (@) which belong to the moor who be continual in war as also we can by no mean know the end of their journey or course thus much out of Francis (@) of the mineral and first of miner all salt the great part of Africa have none other salt but such as

of the foresay tree break into small piece they close up the mouth of the furnace and make a fire under it by the heat whereof the pitch distil forth of the wood through the bottom of the furnace into the foresay hollow place and so it be take up and put in bladder or bag of the fruit call Maus or Musa this fruit grow upon a small tree which bear large and broad leaf of a long have a most excellent

upon the say mountain have lose their virginity by none other occasion but by make water upon the say root unto who I will in merriment answer that I belceve all which experience have teach concern the secret virtue of the same root yea they affirm moreover that some of their maiden be so infect with this root that they be not only deflower of their virginity but have also their whole body puff up and swell these be the thing memorable and worthy of knowledge see and observe by i John Leo throughout all Africa which country I have in * * * * * * * * * * * * * * that be in Barbary Numidia Libya the land of negro and Egypt all place travel quite over wherein whatsoever I see worthy the observation I present commit to writing and those thing which I see not I procure to be at large declare unto i by most credible and substantial person which be themselves eie-witness of the same and so have get a fit opportunity I think good to reduce these my travel and study into this one volume write at Rome in the year of Christ 1526. and upon the ten of March. here end the description of Africa write by John Leo bear in Granada and bring up in Barbary a brief relation concern the dominion revenue force and manner of government of sundry the great prince either inhabit within the bound of Africa or at least possess some part thereof translate for the most part out of italian AFricke have ever be the least know and haunt part in the world chief by reason of the situation thereof under the torrid zone which the ancient think to be unhabitable who opinion although in very deed it be not true because we know that between the two tropic there be most fruitful country as namely Abassia and the kingdom of angola and congo with all India new Spain and Brasile yet neither be it altogether false for no part of the world have great desert nor vast wilderness than this of Africa these desert which extend themselves from the atlantic ocean even unto the border of Egypt for more than a thousand mile and run out sometime two hundred and otherwhiles 300. mile in breadth divide Africa into two part whereof the southerly part be never thorough know to the people of Europe as also Atlas which divide Numidia from Africa the less be some impediment to the same and towards the east it seem that nature also mean to conceal the same by those desert that lie betwixt the red sea and the land of Egypt in the first time after the flood we find mention very often make of the kingdom of Egypt and ethopia and as for Ethiopia the notice we have thereof be but obscure and confuse but Egypt by reason of the commodious situation thereof between the Mediterran and the red sea have always be renown and famous yea king Sesostris that egyptian monarch enlarge his empire from the atlantic ocean even to the euxine sea afterward the king of Numidia and Mauritania and the carthaginian flourish in those province which be bound by the Meditterran sea in our time wherein all Africa have be and be daily environ there be sufficient knowledge have of the marine part thereof but for the inland province there be not so much know as may be rather through want of writer then for default of discovery and trade now therefore leave those part of Africa which be possess by the Turk and the king of Spain to a brief narration in the last place we have reduce all the residue of our relation to three prince that be to Prete janni the Monomotapa and the Xeriffo who be king of Maroco and Fez for the rest refer you to John Leo and the discourse prefix before he the Xeriffo reign between Atlas and the atlantic ocean Prete janni about the centre of Africa and the Monomotapa have his empire towards the sinus Barbaricus or the barbarian gulf the empire of Prete janni the empire of Prete janni answer not certain in effect although it be very large unto the fame and opinion which the common sort and most writer have of it for lately of any other Hor Malugucci in a certain discourse of he touch the greatness of state at this day will needs have his dominion to be great than any other prince but the king of Spain I confess indeed that in time past his state have most ample and large confine as may be judge by the multitude of kingdom with which he adorn and set forth his style for he entitle himself king of Goiame a kingdom seat beyond Nilus and of Vangue and damut situate beyond Zaire and yet it be at this day evident know that his empire scarce reach unto Nilus yea and John Barros write that the abassin have little notice of that river by reason of the mountain lie between they and it the hart or centre of his state be the lake Barcena for on the east it extend from Suaquen as far as the entrance of the red sea for the space of a hundred and two and twenty league howbeit betwixt the red sea and it there thwart a long rank of mountain inhabit by the moor who also command the sea-coast on the west it have another ridge of mountain along the channel of Nilus inhabit by the gentile who pay tribute unto the Prete on the north it consine with a imaginary line draw from Suaquen to the further part of the isle of Meroe which be a hundred and five and twenty league long from hence it make as it be a bow but not very crooked towards the south even to the kingdom of adel from the mountain whereof spring that river which Ptolemey call and place to the south of Melinde for the space of two hundred and thirty league all which distance be border upon by the gentile from whence it turn and end eastward at the kingdom of adel who head city be Arar in the northerly latitude of nine degree so that this whole empire little more or less amount to six hundred threescore and twelve league in circuit the country which be distinguish with ample plain pleasant hill and high mountain most of they manurable and well inhabit bring forth barley and mill for it abound not great with other sort of grain and likewise Taffo da guza another good and durable seed but there be mill and Zaburro which we call the grain of India or guinea wheat great plenty with all sort of our pulse and some also unknown to we some of they wear clothes of cotton but the great part be clad in sheep skin and those which be more honourable in the skin of lion tiger and ounce they have all kind of our domestical creature as hen goose and such like as also abundance of kine and wild swine heart goat hare but no coney beside panther lion ounce and elephant to conclude there can be a country more apt than this for the generation and increase of all plant and creature true it be that it have little help or furtherance by the industry of the inhabitant because they be of a slothful dull nature and capacity they have flax and yet can make no cloth sugar cane and know not the art of get the sugar thereout iron and have no use thereof but take all smith to be negromancer they have river and water and know not how to better their possession by they they conceive not great of hunt or fish whereupon the field be full of bird and wild beast and the river and lake of fish another reason of their slackness and negligence be the evil entreaty of the commonalty by those of the mighty sort for the poor see every thing take from they that they have sow no more then very necessity urge they unto their speech also be without any rule or prescription and to write a letter require a great assembly of man and many day to deliberate thereon the noble citizen and peasant live distinct and apart and any of these may purchase nobility by some famous or worthy act the first bear inherit all thing there be not in all the country a castle or fortify place for they think as the spartan do that a country shall be maintain and defend by force of arm and not with rampire of earth or stone they dwell for the most part disperse in town and village their trade of merchandise be perform by exchange one thing for a other supply the overplus of their prize with wheat or salt pepper incense myrrh and salt they sell for the weight in gold in their bargain they use gold also but by weight silver be not ordinary among they their great city be the prince court which be never firm and resident in one place but remove here and there and remain in the open field under tent this court comprehend ten or more mile in compass his government PRete janni his government be very absolute for he hold his subject in most base servitude and no less the noble and great than those of mean quality and condition entreat they rather like slave than subject and the better to do this he maintain himself among they in the reputation of a sacred and divine person all man bow at the name of the prince and touch the earth with their hand they reverence the tent wherein he lie and that when he be absent also the pretes in time past be wont to be see of the people but only once in three year space and afterwards they show themselves thrice in a year that be on Christmas and Easter day as also on holy rood day in September who now reign albeit he be grow more familiar than his predecessor yet when any commission come from he the party to who it be direct hear the word thereof naked from the girdle upward neither put he on his apparel but when the king permit he the people think they bind it with a oath yet do they seldom speak truth but when they swear by the king life who give and take away what great signiory soever it please he neither may he from who it be take so much as show himself aggrieve therewith except the give of holy order and the administration of the sacrament he dispose as well of the religious as of the lie sort and of their good on the way he ride environ with high and long red curtain which compass he on every side he wear usual upon his head a crown half gold half silver and a cross of silver in his hand his face be cover with a piece of blue taffeta which he lift up or let down more or less according as he favour they that he treat withal and sometime he only show the end of his foot which he put forth from under the say curtain they that carry and return ambassage come not to his curtain but with long time diverse ceremony and sundry observation none have slave but himself to who every year his subject come to do homage this prince as the abassin report descend from a son of Solomon and the queen of Saba call Meilech they

of his possession which he cause to be manure by his slave and ox these slave multiply continual for they marry among themselves and their son remain in the condition of their progenitor another great revenue come of his tribute which be bring unto he from all those that hold dominion under he and of these some give horse some ox some gold some cotton and other other thing it be think he have great treasure as well of clothes and jewel as of gold and also that he have treasury and large magazine of the same riches so that write once to the king of Portugal he offer to give for the maintenance of war against the infidel a hundred thousand dram of gold with infinite store of man and victual they say that he put ordinary every year into the castle of the value of three million of ducat it be true that before the day of king Alexander they lay not up so much gold because they know not how to purify it but rather jewel and wedge of gold also his commings-in may be say to be of three sort for some he raise as it be out of his crowne-lande another part he levy of the people that pay he so much for a house and the ten of all those mine that be dig by other then by himself and a three revenue he draw from his tributary prince and governor and these give he the entire revenue of one of their city so as he choose not that city wherein they make their residence but though his wealth and revenue be great yet be his people of little worth as well because he hold they in the estimation of slave by mean whereof they want that generosity of mind which make man ready to take up arm and to be courageous in danger as also it seem they have ever their hand bind with that awful reverence which they bear towards their prince and the fear they have of he and further in that they have no arm of defence but bad headpiece half skull and coat of mail carry thither by the portugal hereunto may be add his want of fortress for neither have strong place whither to retire nor arm to defend themselves they and their town remain as a pray to the enemy their offensive arm be unfeathered arrow and some dart they have a lend of fifty day continuance which through the great abstinence wherein they pass all that time do so weaken and afflict they that neither for those day nor many other follow they have the strength to stir abroad whereupon the moor attend this opportunity and assail they with great advantage Francis Aluares write that Prete janni can bring into the field a hundred thousand man nevertheless in time of need it have be see that he can make nothing so many he have a military religion or order of knighthood under the protection of saint (@) whereunto every noble man must ordain one of every three male child but not the elder and out of these be constitute twelve

prince as far as we can certain understand confine especial with three other mighty prince one be the king of Borno another the great Turk and the three the king of adel. the king of Buruo rule over that country which extend from Guangara towards the east about five hundred mile between the desert of and barca be of a uneeven situation because it be partly mountainous and partly plain in the

king of adel who hem it in between the east and the south they disturb the Prete exceed restrain the limit of his empire and bring his country into great misery for the turk beside the put of a great part of Barnagasso to sack and spoil upon which they enter the year of our lord 1558. although they be drive out again have further take all that from the Prete which he possess on the sea coast especial the port and town of Suaquen and Ercoco in which two place the mountain lie betwixt Abassia and the red sea do open and make a passage for conveyance of victual and traffic between the

great value out of their own country whereupon the border and other prince both far and near esteem they much and many of they by mean of their industry in service of slave have become captain and great commander in Arabia Cambaia Bengala and sumatra because the mahometan prince of the east be all tyrant over kingdom usurp from the gentile for security of their state put no trust in their own

fidelity as for sound and good complexion and because the king of adel with the multitude of these Abassin slave which he take in the town and territory of Prete janni fill all Egypt and Arabia in exchange of who he have armour munition and soldier both from the Turk and the arabian prince in the year of our lord 1550. Claudius king of Abassia be after this sort sore oppress by gradaamed king of adel who now for the space of fowerteene year have with continual incursion grievous molest and disturb he enforce he to leave his confine and to retire into the hart of his empire demand aid of Stephano gama the indian viceroy of John the three king of Portugal who be then with a good fleet upon the red sea whereupon he send he four hundred portugal with a good quantity of arm and small shot under the government of Christopher da gama his brother with these man by the benefit of shot he overthrow the enemy in two battle but in the three the king of adel have receive a thousand turkish harquebuzier from the governor of Zebit with ten piece of artillery the abassin be put to (@) and discomfit and their captain take prisoner and put (@) death but the king of adel afterward send back the say turk he and his people be sudden assail near the river of Zeila and mount saval by king Claudius with threescore thousand foot and five hundred Abassin horse together with those portugal who remain of the former overthrow one of who wound gradame dangerous but in the month of march the year of our lord 1559. king Claudius be set upon again by the Malacai mores he be slay in the battle and the enimie-king acknowledge so great a victory from the hand of God triumph upon a ass Adamas brother unto king Claudius succeed he against who for he be half a mahometan the best part of the abassine nobility rebel and he be defeat by the Barnagasso in the year 1562. who have thus for a while disturb the affair of Ethiopia it seem that they be at length assuage and reestablish under Alexander by the aid of the portugal who have carry thither arm as well of offence as defence and stir up the mind and courage of the abassine by their example to war for all those that remain of the discomfiture give to Christopher gama and diverse other which come thither afterward and do daily there arrive and stay do marry wife and have child and Alexander permit they to elect a judge who may execute justice among they so that they have and do daily bring into Abassia the manner of warfare in Europe with our use of arm and the manner of fortify passage and place of importance afterward certain florentine go into those country partly upon pleasure and partly for affair of merchandise for Francisco Medici great duke of Florence have some commerce with the abassine the Prete therefore give entertainment and make much of the Frankes for so do they call the people of Europe and hardly give they licence to depart out of his kingdom beside these the Prete janni have diverse other enemy among who be the king of Dancali to who the town and port of Vela upon the red sea pertain he confine with Balgada the moor also vex he great which inhabit the province call doba divide into fowerteene signiory for though they be within the confine of Prete janni his empire yet notwithstanding for the most part they

of his neighbour of Mohenemugi and of the limit of both their dominion as likewise of the amazon and Giacchi the chief strength of their military force and other memorable matter to avoid tedious repetition I refer the reader to the discourse go before the book save only that I will here annex a brief testimony out of Osorius lib 4 reb gest Eman. which may add some small light unto the treatise before mention but say he in this part of Ethiopia lie beyond the cape of good hope which be bound by the south ocean there be a most ample kingdom call Benomotapa whereunto before such time

end that be take he may be put to such torment as be correspondent to his disloyalty hitherto Osorius the Xeriffo common call the king of Maroco (@) and Fez. among all the prince of Africa I suppose that there be not any one who in richness of state or greatness of power may be prefer before the Xeriffo in that his dominion which comprehend all that part of Mauritania call by the roman Tingitana extend itself north and south from Capo boiador even to Tanger and east and west from the atlantic ocean as far as the river Muluia and somewhat further also in which space be comprehend the fair fruitful best inhabit and most civil part of all africa and among other the state the most famous kingdom of Maroco and Fez. with the particular description whereof and of all the province city town river mountain etc. therein contain the reader may satisfy himself to the full in the second and three book of the history of John Leo before set down these kingdom beside their natural fertility be very traffickable for though the king of Fez have no haven of importance upon the mediterranean sea nevertheless the english french and other nation traffic much to his port upon the ocean especial to

thither copper and brass with arm and diverse commodity of Europe for which among other thing they return sugar but because these kingdom of Maroco and Fez and diverse other signiory and principality at first separate and divide be unite not long sithence under one prince who be call * * * * or Miramonin the Xeriffo it will not be much from our purpose because among the accident of our time I think there be not any one more notable or wonderful than this to set down here how the matter pass about the year of our lord 1508 a certain alchaide bear in the manner how the Xeriffos aspire to the kingdom of Maroco Sus and Fez. a town of dara who name be Mahumet Benametto and who cause himself to be call Xeriffo be a subtle man and of a mind no less ambitious then learned in those science whereunto the mahometan be most addict begin to grow famous in the town of Numidia this man vaunt himself to be descend of mahumets progeny be possess with a imagination trust in the division of the state of Africa wherein then the portugal bear great sway of take into his own hand all * * * * * * * * * or the kingdom of Maroco and Fez. Mauritania Tingitana for performance of this he first send his three (@) Abdel Abnet and Mahumet in pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina there to visit and do reverence to the sepulchre of their seductor Mahumet the young man perform this voyage with so great fame and reputation of sanctity and religion if these word may be use in declare of such a impiety that in their return the people come out to meet they kiss their garment and reverence they as saint they feign themselves to be ravish into deep contemplation go up and down the street sigh and cry out in word interrupt with lamentation and yearn Ala and they live of nothing but alm their father have take they home with great mirth and joy but yet not mind to suffer this sudden applause and credit which they have obtain by such a pilgrimage to freeze and wax cold he send two of they which be * * * * or Abnet and Mahumet to Fez where be courteous receive by the king one of they become a reader in the a most famous college of that city and the the young be make tutor to the same king young son these two see themselves so entire belove of the king and in so great favour with the people be advise by their father and take occasion upon the damage which the arabian and moor do to those of their own law and sect under the ensign of the portugal in who pay they serve they demand leave of the king to display a (@) against the christian put he in hope as indeed it fall out that they will easy draw those moor unto he who be follower of the crown of Portugal and by this mean secure the province of Sus Hea Ducala Maroco with other molest and evil entreat by the portugal this request be contradict by nazer brother to the king for say he if these man under pretence of holiness and defence of their law shall have some prosperous proceed with arm in hand it will not afterward be in thy power o king to bridle or bring they down for arm make man courageous and by victory they prove insolent and the rout of ambitious people be always desirous of innovation but the king who have a great opinion of their sanctity make small account of the reason his brother allege unto he give they a banner and drumslade and twenty horse to accompany they with letter of recommendation to the arabian the prince and the city of Barbary with these beginning many people run headlong after their fame they overcome Ducala and the country of * * * * or Azaphi Saphia and go forward even as far as cabo de Guer which place then be subject to the portugal and find themselves strong both in retinue and credit they demand of the people who at that time live for the most part free and come in to none but such as they like of themselves that see they now take up arm for the mahumetane law against the christian they shall aid they with their ten due unto God the which be present yield unto they by the people of dara and so they seize by little and little upon tarodant where their father be make governor and likewise of Sus Hea Ducala and other place adjoin they first plant themselves in tedn and then in tesarote and in a conflict (@) Lopes barriga a famous captain among the portugal but so they lose their own elder brother therein and afterward by fair word enter into the (@) of Maroco they poison the king and in his stead make Xeriffo to be proclaim king of Maroco in the mean while the arabian of Ducala and come to hand blow with those of Garbia each party hold themselves in the xeriffoe favour but the Xeriffos perceive the skirmish to grow hot and that many both of the one and of the other party go to wrack turn their arm against they both and enrich themselves with their spoil in former time they use to send unto the king of Fez the five of all those booty which they get but after this victory make no reckon of their say custom they present he only with six horse and six camel and those but silly one whereat be move he send to demand of they the five part of their spoil and the tribute that the king of Maroco pay he threaten otherwise war upon they but in the mean while this man die his son who be scholar to the young Xeriffo be not only content but further confirm in the signiory of Maroco so that in some small matter he will acknowledge the king of Fez for sovereign prince over that city but on the other side the xeriffi who reputation and power daily increase when the time of pay tribute come send to certify this young king that be lawful successor to Mahumet they be not bind to pay tribute to any and that they have more right to Africa than he so that if he will have they his friend so it be otherwise if he mean to divert they from this their war against the christian they shall not want courage nor power to defend themselves wherewith the Fessan king be offend proclaim war against they and go himself in person to the siege of Maroco but at the very first he be drive to dislodge and afterward return with eighteen thousand horse among who be two thousand harquebuzier or bowman he be vanquish by the xeriffi who have no more but seven thousand horse and twelve hundred harquebuzier which be place on the way at the passage of a river by mean of this victory the Xeriffi shake off the tribute of that country and pass over Atlas they take tafilete a important city and partly by fair mean partly by force they bring diuers people of Numidia to their obedience as also those of the mountain in the year of our lord 1536. the young Xeriffo who be now call king of Sus have gather together a mighty army and much artillery take in part from the king of Fez and partly artillery cast by french renegado cast by the french renegado he go to the enterprise of cabo de Guer a very important fortification hold then by the portugal which be build and fortify first at the charge of Lopes Sequeira and afterward know their opportunity from the king don Emanuel there be fight on both side a most terrible battle in the end fire take hold on the munition and upon this the soldier be daunt that defend the fortress the Xeriffo enter thereinto take the town and make the great part of the garrison his prisoner by this victory the xeriffi bring in a manner all Atlas and the kingdom of Maroco to their obedience and those arabian who serve the crown of Portugal whereupon king John the three see that his expense far exceed the revenue which come in of his own accord give over Safia Azamor Arzilla and Alcazar hold which he have on the coast of Mauritania this (@) be a occasion of grievous discord betwixt the brother the issue whereof be that the young have in two battle subdue the elder whereof the second be in the year of our lord 1554 and take he prisoner he banish he to Tafilet and afterward turn his arm against the king of Fez after have take he once prisoner and then release he he yet the second time because he break promise get he into his hand again deprive he of his estate and in the end cause both he and his son to be slay and by mean of his own son he also take tremizen in the mean while araes viceroy of Algiers fear the Xeriffos prosperous success gather together a great army with which he first recover tremizen and afterward defeat the Xeriffo conquer Fez and give the government thereof to Buasson prince of Veles but this man join battle with the Xeriffo lose at one instant both his city and kingdom in the end Mahumet go to tarodant be upon the way slay in his pavilion by the treason of some turk suborn thereunto by the viceroy of Algiers of who one assen be the chief who together with his companion go into tarodant and there make havoc of the king treasure but in their return home they be all but five slay by the people in the year 1559 and Abdala the Xeriffos son be proclaim and salute king let thus much suffice to have be speak of the Xeriffo who proceed appear much like to those of Ishmael the sophy of persia. both of they procure follower by blood and the cloak of religion both of they subdue in short time many country both of they grow great by the ruin of their neighbour both of they receive grievous check by the turk and lose a part of their state for Selym take from Ishmael Cacamit and diverse other city of Diarbena and the viceroy of Algiers do drive the Xeriffo out of tremizen and his other quarter and even as Selim win Tauris the head city of Persia and afterwards give it over so araes take Fez the head city of Mauritania and then after abandon the same the Xeriffo his revenue or come in the Xeriffo be absolute lord of all his subject good yea and of their person also for though he charge they with never so burdensome tribute and imposition yet dare they not so much as open their mouth he receive from his tributary vassal the ten and first fruit of their corn and cattle true it be that for the first fruit he take no more but one for twenty and the whole be above twenty he demand no more than two though it amount to a hundred for every day tilth of ground he have a ducat and a quarter and so much likewise for every house as also he have after the same rate of every person above fifteen year old male or female and when need require a great sum and to the end that the people may the more cheerful pay that which be impose upon they he always demand half as much more as he be to receive most true it be that on the mountain there inhabit certain fierce and vatamed people who by reason of the steep craggy and inexpugnable situation of their country can be force to tribute that which be get of they be the ten of their corn and fruit only that they may be permit to have recourse into the plain beside these revenue the king have the toll and custom of Fez and of other city for at the enter of their good the natural citizen pay two in the hundred and the stranger ten he have further the revenue of mill and many other thing the carwen the principal mahometan temple in Fez be a mile and a (@) about read Leo lib. 3. sum whereof be very great for the mill yield he little less than half a royal of plate for every Hanega of corn that be ground in Fez where as they say there be above four hundred mill the moschea of carwen have fourscore thousand ducat of rent the college and hospital of Fez have also many thousand all which the king have at this present and further he be heir to all the alcayde and they that have pension of he and at their death he possess their horse armour garment and all their good howbeit if the decease leave any son apt for the service of the war he grant they their father provision but if they be but young he bring up the male child to year of service and the daughter till they be marry and therefore that he may have some interest in the good of rich man he bestow upon they some government or charge with provision wherefore for fear of confiscation after death every one covet to (@) his wealth or to remove far from the court and the king sight for which cause the city of Fez come far short of her ancient glory beside his revenue have be augment of late year by mighty sum of gold which he fetch from Tombuto and Gago in the land of negro which gold according to the report of some may yearly amount to three million of ducat his force the Xeriffo have not any fortress of great importance but only upon the sea-coast as cabo de Guer and Tetuan for as the turk and persian do so he place the strength of his state in arm man but especial in horse and for this cause he stand not much upon his artillery although he have very great store which his predecessor take from the portugal and other in Fez Maroco Tarodant and in the foresay (@) cause also more to be cast when need require for he want not master of Europe in this science he have a house of munition in Maroco where they make ordinary six and forty quintal of powder every month as likewise also caliver and steele-bowe in the year of our lord 1569. a fire take hold on these house with such fury that a great part of the city be destroy therewith but for the xeriffoe force they be of two sort the first be of two thousand seven hundred horse and two thousand harquibuzier which he have partly in Fez but most in Maroco where he be resident be as it be of his daily guard the second be of a royal squadron of six thousand gentleman be all of noble parentage and of great account these man be mount upon excellent horse with furniture and arm for variety of colour most beautiful and for riches of ornament beyond measure estimable for every thing about they shine with gold silver pearl jewel and whatsoever else may please the eye or satisfy the curiosity of beholder these man beside provision of corn oil butter and flesh for themselves their wife child and servant receive further in wage from seventy to a hundred ounce of silver a man the three sort of force which he have consist of his * Timariotti these be a military order like unto they which hold land (@) we under the (@) of knight service for the Xeriffo grant to all his son and brother and other person of account or authority among the people of Africa or to the prince of the arabian the benefit of great lordship and tenor for sustentation of his

their person they also give they cloth linen and silk to apparel themselves arm of offence and defence and horse with which they serve in the war and if they die or be kill they allow they other a thing which be also use in Rome towards they that serve on public horse every one of these leader contend to bring his people into the field well order for arm apparel and horse beside this they have between four and twenty and thirty ounce of silver wage every year his four military force be the arabian who live continual in their for so they call their habitation each one of they consist of a hundred or two hundred (@) govern by diverse alchaide to the end they may be ready in time of need these serve on horseback but they be rather to be account thief then true soldier his five kind of force military be somewhat like unto the train soldier of christian prince and among these the inhabitant of city and village of the kingdom and of the mountain be enrol it be true that the king make but little account of they and very seldom put arm into their hand for fear of insurrection and rebellion except in the war against the christian for than he can convenient forbid they for it be write in their law that if Moor kill a Christian or be slay by he he go direct into paradise a diabolical invention man woman and those of every age and degree run to the war hand over head that at least they may there be slay and by this mean according to their foolish opinion gain heaven no less zeal to our confusion may we perceive in the turk especial for defence of their sect for one will think they go to a marriage and not to the war scarce be able with patience to attend their prefix time of go thither they repute they holy and happy that die with arm in hand against their enemy as on the contrary those man unhappy and of little worth that die at home amid the lamentation of child and outcry of woman by the thing above set down we may easy comprehend what number of man the Xeriffo can bring into the field but yet we may learn better by experience for Abdala in the year 1562. besiege mazagan with two hundred thousand man choke the ditch with a mountain of earth and beat down the wall thereof with his artillery but for all this he be enforce by the valour of the portugal and the damage which he receive by their mine to give over his siege beside this prince can not continue a great war above two or three month and the reason hereof be because his force live on that provision which he have daily come in as well for sustenance as for apparel and not be able to have all this conduct thither where the war require it follow of necessity that in short time they must needs return home for their maintenance of life and further it be a evident thing that no man can protract a war at length except he be rich in treasure Molucco who overthrow Sebastian king of Portugal have in pay under his ensign forty thousand horse and eight thousand foot beside arabian and adventurer but it be think he can have bring into the field seventy thousand horse and more foot than he do of the dominion and fortress which the king of Spain have upon the isle and main land of Africa and of the great quantity of treasure and other commodity which be bring from thence beside oran Mersalquibir Melilla and pennon which the king of Spain possess within the straits as likewise Tanger and Arzil which by the title of Portugal he hold very near the straits of Gibraltar and mazagan in like sort without the straits mouth twenty mile to the southward of Arzil he have along the coast of Africa from cape de Guer to that of Guardafu two sort of state for some be immedidiate under he and other be as it be his adherent the land of madera puerto santo the canary the isle of Arguin of cabo Verde the isle with that of Sant Thomas and other near adjoin be immediate under his dominion these island be maintain with their own victual and provision and yet they have also some out of Europe as in like manner they send some thither especial sugar and fruit wherewith the isle of madera wonderful abound as also with wine and the island of Sant Thomas likewise have great abundance of sugar these state have no encumbrance but by the english and french man of war * * * * * * * * * my author here much mistake the matter which for all that go not beyond cape Verde at the island of Arguin and at Sant George de la mina the portugal have plant factory in form of fortress by mean of which they trade with the border people of Guinie and Libya and get into their hand the gold of Mandinga and other place near about among the adherent prince the rich and most honourable be the king of congo in that his kingdom be one of the most flourish and plentiful country in all Ethiopia the portugal have there two colony one in the city of s. Saluador and a other in the island Loanda they have diverse rich commodity from this kingdom but the most important be every year about 5000. slave which they transport from thence and sell they at good round prize in all the isle and main land of the west indies and for the head of every slave so take up there be a good tax pay to the crown of Portugal from this kingdom one may easy go to the country of Prete janni for it be not think to be very far off and it do so abound with elephant victual and all other necessary thing as will bring singular ease and commodity to such a enterprise upon the kingdom of congo confine angola with who prince of late year Paulo Dias a Portugal captain make war and the principal occasion of this war be certain mine of silver in the mountain of cabambe no whit inferior to those of Potossi but by so much be they better as fine silver go beyond that which be base and course and out of doubt if the portugal have esteem so well of thing near at hand as they do of those far off and remote and have thither bend their force wherewith they pass Capo and go to India malaca and the malucoe they have more easy and with less charge find great wealth for there be no country in the world rich in gold and silver than the kingdom of Mandinga Ethiopia congo angola butua Toroa Maticuo Boro Monomotapa Cafati and but human avarice esteem more of a other man than his own and thing remote appear great than those near at hand between cabo and cape Guardafu the portugal have the fortress of Sena Cephala and mozambique and by these they continue master of the trade with the border nation all which abound in gold and ivory by these fortress they have special commodity for their navigation to the indies because their fleet sometime winter and otherwhiles victual and refresh themselves there in these part the king of Melinde be their great friend and those of Quiloa and other neighbour-island be their tributary the portugal want nothing but man for beside other island which they leave in a manner abandon there be that of saint Laurence one of the great in all the world be a thousand two hundred mile long and four hundred and fower-score broad the which though it be not well till yet for the goodness of the soil it be apt and fit to be manure nature have distinguish it with river harbour and most commodious bay these state belong to the crown of Portugal fear no other but such sea-force as may be bring thither by the turk but the daily go to and fro of the Portugal fleet which coast along up and down those sea altogether secure they in the year 1589. they take near unto Mombaza four galley and a galliot belong to the turk who be so bold as to come even thither the dominion of the great Turk in Africa the great Turk possess in Africa all the sea-coast from velez de Gumera or as some hold opinion from the river Muluia which be the eastern limit of the kingdom of Fez even to the arabian gulf or red sea except some few place as namely Mersalcabir Melilla oran and pennon which the king of Spain hold in which space before mention be situate sundry of the most famous city and kingdom in all Barbary that be to say tremizen alger tenez Bugia Constantina Tunis Tripoli and all the country of Egypt from Alexandria to the city of Asna call of old Siene together with some part of Arabia from the town of suez to that of Suachen also in Africa the grand signior have five viceroy call by the name of beglerbeg or bassa namely at alger Tunis Tripoli at missir for all Egypt and at Suachen for those place which be challenge by the great Turk in the dominion of Prete janni final in this part at suez in the bottom of the arabian gulf be one of his four principal arsenal or place for the building repair dock and harbour of his warlike galley which may lie here under covert to the number of five and twenty bottom a summary discourse of the manifold religion profess in Africa and first of the gentile AFrica contain four sort of people different in religion that be to say gentile jew mahometan and christian the gentile extend themselves along the shore of the ocean in a manner from cabo blanco or the white cape even to the northern border of congo as likewise from the southerly bound of the same kingdom even to Capo Esperanca and from thence to that and within the land they spread out from the ethiopic ocean even unto Nilus and beyond Nilus also from the ethiopic to the arabian sea these gentile be of diverse sort for some of they have no light of God or religion neither they be govern by any rule or law whereupon the arabian call they Cafri that be to say lawless or without law they have but few habitation and they live for the most part in cave of mountain or in wood wherein they find some harbour from wind and rain the civil among they who have some understanding and light of divinity and religion obey the Monomotapa who dominion extend with a great circuit from the confine of Matama to the river Cuama but the noble part thereof be comprehend between the mighty river of Magnice or Spirito Sancto and that of (@) for the space of six hundred league they have no idol and believe in one only God call by they Mozimo little differ from these we may esteem the subject of Mohenemugi but among all the Cafri the people call agag or Giacchi be repute most brutish inhabit in wood and den and be devourer of man flesh they dwell upon the left bank of Nilus between the first and second lake the Anzichi also have a shambles of man flesh as we have of the flesh of ox they eat their enemy who they take in war they sell their slave to butcher if they can light on no great prize and they inhabit from the river Zaire even to the desert of Nubia some other of they be rather addict to witchcraft then to idolatry consider that in a man the fear of a superior power be so natural that though he adore nothing under the name and title of a god yet do he reverence and fear some superiority although he know not what it be such be the Biafresi and their neighbour all of they be addict in such sort to witchcraft as that they vaunt that by force of enchantment they can not only charm and make man die much more molest and bring they to hard point but further raise wind and rain and make the sky to thunder and lighten and that they can destroy all herb and plant and make the flock and herd of cattle to fall down dead whereupon they reverence more the devil than any thing else sacrifice unto he of their beast and fruit of the earth yea their own blood also and their child such be likewise the priest of angola who they call ganghe these make profession that they have in their hand dearth and abundance fair weather and foul life and death for which cause it can not be express in what veneration they be hold among these barbarian in the year 1587. a Portugal captain be in a part of angola with his soldier a Ganga be request by the people to refresh the field which be dry and wither with some quantity of water he need no great entreaty but go forth with diverse little bell in presence of the portugal he spend a half hour in fetch suudry gambol and skip and utter diverse superstitious murmur and behold a cloud arise in the air with lightning and thunder the portugal grow amaze but all the barbarian with great joy admire and extol unto heaven their Ganga who now give out intolerable brag not know what hang over his head for the wind outrageous blow the sky thunder after a dreadful manner in stead of the rain by he promise there fall a thunderbolt which like a sword cut his head clean from his shoulder some other idolater not look much aloft worship earthly thing such be the people of congo before their conversion and be at this day those that have not yet receive the gospel for these man worship certain dragon with wing and they foolish nourish they in their house with the delicate meat that they have they worship also serpent of horrible shape goat tiger and other creature and the more they fear and reverence they by how much the more deform and monstrous they be among the number of their god also they reckon bat owl owlet tree and herb with their figure in wood and stone and they do not only worship these beast live but even their versy kin when they be dead be fill with straw or some other matter and the manner of their idolatry be to bow down before the foresay thing to cast themselves grovel upon the earth to cover their face with dust and to offer unto they of their best substance some lift up their mind a little high worship star such be the people of Guinie and their neighbour who be incline to the worship of the sun the great part of they and they hold opinion that the soul of those dead that live well mount up into heaven and there dwell perpetual near unto the sun neither want there among these certain other so superstitious as they worship for God the first thing they meet withal come out of their house they also hold their king in the account and estimation of god who they suppose to be descend from heaven and their king to maintain themselves in such high reputation be serve with wonder ceremony neither will they be see but very seldom of the jew the jew who have be disperse by god throughout the whole world to confirm we in the holy faith enter into Ethiopia in the queen of Sabas day in company of a son that Solomon have by she to the number as the abassin affirm of twelve thousand and there multiply their generation exceed in that they not only fill Abassia but spread themselves likewiseall over the neighbour province so that at this day also the abassin affirm that upon Nilus towards the west there inhaibt a most populous nation of the jewish stock under a mighty k. and some of our modern cosmographer set down a province in those quarter which they call the land of the hebrew place as it be under the equinoctial in certain unknown mountain between the confine of Abassia and congo and likewise on the north part of the kingdom of Goiame and the southerly quarter of the kingdom of gorham there be certain mountain people with jew who there maintain themselves free and absolute through the inaccessiable situation of the same for in truth by this mean the inhabitant of the mountain speak general be the most ancient and free people in that the strong situation of their native soil secure they from the incursion of foreign nation and the violence of their neighbour such be the scot in Britain and the biskaine in Spain but to return again to our purpose the Anzichi who extend from the bank of the river Zaire even to the confine of Nubia use circumcision as also diverse other border people do a thing that must necessary have be bring in by the jew and yet remain still in use after the annihilation of the mosaical law among they some also think that the people call Cafri or Cafates at this day who be gentile draw their original from the jew but be environ on every side by idolater they have by little and little swerve from the law of Moses and so be become as it be insensible idolater on the other side the jew be wonderful increase in Spain pass one after a other into Africa and Mauritania and disperse themselves even to the confine of Numidia especial by mean of traffic and the profession of goldsmith the which be utter forbid the mahometan be altogether practise among they by the jew as be likewise diverse other mechanical craft but principal that of black smith a thing which notable appear in mount in the kingdom of Maroco and in mount it be say that eitdevet a town in the kingdom of Maroco be inhabit by the jew of the stock as they affirm of David who notwithstanding by little and little be grow mahumetan the jew increase afterward in Africa when first (@) king of Spain call the catholic and after he Emanuel king of Portugal put they forth of their dominion for then many go over into the kingdom of Fez and Maroco and bring in thither the art and profession of Europe unknown before to those barbarian in Teza Elmedina Tefsa and in segelmesse every placeis full of they they pass also by way of traffic even to Tombuto although John Leo write how that king be so great their enemy that he confiscate the good of those that trade with they it import i not to speak of Egypt because it have ever be as well by reason of the neerne of Palestina as for the commodity of traffic whereunto they be much incline as it be their second country here in great number and in a manner in all the city and town thereof they exercise mechanical art and use traffic and merchandise as also take upon they the receipt of tax and custom but above all other place in Alexandria and cairo where they amount to the number of five and twenty thousand and the civil sort among they do usual speak the castilian tongue (@) much may suffice to have be speak concern the jew it now remain that we come to entreat of the mahometan of Africa concern who before we make any particular relation it will not be amiss for the reader more perfect instruction to speak somewhat in general as namely of the sinister proceed of their first seducer Mahumet of the variety and propagation of their damn sect over the east and south part of the world of the four principal nation which be the maintainer and upholder of this diabolical religion and of sundry other particular most worthy the observation of Mahumet and of his accurse religion in general MAhumet his father be a certain profane idolater call Abdala of the stock of Ishmael and his mother be one * * * * or Emina a jew both of they be of very humble and poor condition he be bear in the year of our lord 562. and be endow with a grave countenance and a quick wit be grow to man estate the arabian accustom to rob and run all over the country take he prisoner and sell he to a persian merchant who discern he to be apt and subtle about business affect and hold he in such account that after his death his mistress remain a widow scorn not to take he for her husband be therefore enrich by this mean with good and credit he raise up his mind to great matter the time then answer very fit for one that will disturb or work any innovation for the arabian upon some evil entreaty be malcontented with the emperor heraclius the heresy of arrius and Nestorius have in a miserable sort shake and annoy the church of God the jew though they want power yet amount they to a great number the saracen prevail mighty both in number and force and the roman empire be full of slave Mahumet therefore take hold on this opportunity frame a law wherein all of they shall have some part or prerogative in this two jew and two heretic assist he of which one be John be a scholar of Nestorius school and the other Sergius of the sect of arrius whereupon the principal intention of this curse law be whole aim against the divinity of our saviour jesus Christ wicked oppugn by the jew and arrian he persuade this law first by give his wife to understand and his neighbour by her mean and by little and little other also that he converse with the angel Gabriel unto who brightness he ascribe the fall sickness which many time prostrate he upon the earth dilate and amplify the same in like sort by permit all that which be plausible to sense and the flesh as also by offer liberty to all slave that will come to he and receive his law wherefore be prosecute hard by the master of those fugitive slave lead away by he he flee to Medina Talnabi and there remain some time from this flight the mahometan fetch the original of their Hegeira but questionless there be nothing that further more the enlargement of the mahometan sect than prosperitic in arm and the multitude of victory whereby Mahumet overthrow the persian become lord of Arabia and drive the roman out of Syria and his successor afterward extend their empire from Euphrates to the atlantic ocean and from the river Niger to the Pirenei mountain and beyond they occupy Sicilia assail Italy and with continual prosperity as it be for three hundred year either subdue or encumber both the east and west but to return to Mahumet his law it embrace circumcision and make a difference between meat pure and unpure partly to allure the jew it deny the divinity of Christ to reconcile the arrian who be then most mighty it foi in many frivolous fable that it may fit the gentile and lose the bridle to the flesh which be a thing acceptable to the great part of man whereupon Avicen though he be a mahometan write thus of such a law say he mahume etc. that be to say our law which Mahumet give we regard the disposition of felicity or misery according to the body but there be another promise which concern the mind or the soul which wise divine have a far great desire to apprehend then that of the body which though it be give unto they yet respect they it not nor hold it in any estimation in comparison of that felicity which be a conjunction with

there be the foolish and (@) sect of Cobtini one of these show himself not many year sithence in the market place and quarter of Algiers mount on a reed with a bridle and rein of leather give the multitude to understand that upon that horse in one night he rid a hundred league and he be for this great honour and reverence in tract of time there grow among the mahometan through the vanity of their law and the incredible variety and difference of opinion great disorder for their sect be not only wicked and treacherous as we have declare but also gross and foolish those that make profession thereof to defend and maintain it be enforce to make a thousand interpretation and construction far sometime from reason and otherwhiles from the express word of Mahumet himself the Califas endeavour mighty to reform this but their provision of great importance be two for first Moavia this man flourish about the year of our lord 770 call a assembly of learned and judicial man to establish that which in their sect shall be believe and to this end he cause all the book of Mahumet and his successor to be gather together but they not agree among themselves he choose out of they six of the most learned and shut they within a house with the say write he command they that every one shall make choice of that which seem best unto he these man reduce the mahometan doctrine into six book set down the penalty of loss of life to they that shall otherwise speak or write of the law but because the arabian give their mind to philosophy in the university of Bagdet Fez Maroco and Cordova and be of pierce and subtle wit they can not but look into the foppery of their sect there be add unto this another proviso which be a statute that forbid they the study of philosophy by mean of which statute

forbid the mahumetan to make restitution of any place once take with arm and wherein they have build a Moschea to conclude they use all manner of circumstance by mean of which they may amplify or enlarge their dominion and sect of the mahometan of Africa in particular the mahometan impiety have spread itself throughout Africa beyond measure this pestilence enter into Egypt in the year of our lord 637. by the arm of Omar from whence a captain of Odoman first pass into Africa in the year 650. with fower-score thousand fight man who there defeat gregorius but they perpetual cast out of

sect in africa first with force of arm by banish of the natural inhabitant the which they may well do by reason of their infinite multitude and of they that verse of David may well be understand the wicked walk round about according to thy greatness thou have multiply the son of man where they can not come nor give no blow with arm there they have ingraff themselves by preach and traffic the heresy of arrius further their enterprise wherewith the vandal and goth be then inhabiter of Africa be infect to further their designment they bring in the arabic language and letter they found university and study both for riches of revenue and magnificence of building most noble especial in Maroco and Fez. but there be nothing that have greatly further the progression of the mahometan sect than perpetuity of victory and the greatness of conquest first of the Califas in the east and afterward of the Miramolines in Africa in that the great part of man yea and in a manner all except such as have fasten their confidence upon the cross of Christ and settle their hope in eternity follow that which best agree with sense and measure the grace of God by worldly prosperity and yet Christ as justinus the philosopher and glorious martyr testify promise no earthly reward to good work carnal man therefore perceive the empire of the Califas and mahumetan continual to increase in the east and west take into their hand both sea and land for this their felicity in arm continue three hundred year wherein they conquer all that which lie between the river abianus and the atlantike ocean and subdue Spain Sicilia and a part of Italy and France and judge that temporal prosperity and victory be the effect and fruit or at least the argument and sign of the grace and favour of God they easy fall into apostasy whereunto the impiety of arrius and other heretic open the way who for long tract of time estrange themselves more and more from the evangelical truth fall in the end into atheism as we see have fall out in the course of some modern enormity but to return from whence we have digress in progress of time there grow great difference between the mahometan for their sect be no less sottish and foolish then wicked and perfidious the maintainer of it be drive to fetch reason far off for defence of the same but the arabian not content in Africa to have subjugate with arm and with false doctrine to have pester Barbary Numidia Libya and the country of negro they further on the other side assail the low Ethiopia both by sea and land by land enter thereinto in the year 1067. Faiaia the son of abubequer and by mean of certain Alsachi he disperse that pestilence into Nubia and the neighbour province on the other side pass the red sea they first take knowledge of the coast of Ethiopia even to cabo by their continual traffic thither and afterward be encourage by the weakness of the natural inhabitant they erect the kingdom of Magadazo Melinde Mombazza Quiloa mozambique and seize on some port of the island of saint Laurence and gather force by little and little they enlarge their empire within the land and establish therein the kingdom of dangali and adel. so that on the one side they have spread their sect from the red sea to the atlantike ocean and from the Mediterran sea to the river Niger and far and on the other have take into their hand all the eastern coast of africa from suez to cape Guardafu and from this even to that and the adjoin island in which place though the people be not altogether mahumetan yet have the mahometan the weapon and dominion in their hand the which how much it import for the bring in of sect we may easy conceive to conclude they have often assail the Prete janni sometime the turk who have take from he the port of the red sea and otherwhiles the moor under the conduct of the king of adel who have and do molest they great lead into captituitie a great number of abassin where they become for the most part mahumetan of the christian of Africa now that we have declare the misery and darkness of Africa it remain that we set down that little light of true religion which there be the which I can not pass over without exceed glory to the Portugal nation in that they with inestimable charge and infinite travail have first seek to open the way to Ethiopia and to bring the great negus of Abassia call by we Prete janni to the union of the Christian church of Europe perform whatsoever after this for the conversion of the prince of Guinia and meleghette to the faith and yet more happy of the king of congo and the prince of angola and likewise with diverse colony send to the island of the atlantic ocean they have no less advance the honour of their own nation than the propagate of the Christian faith and final pass beyond cabo they have resist the mahometan sect which have now extend itself on the backside of Africa as far as cabo of the christian in Egypt the christian of Egypt be partly stranger partly home-born in the country stranger come thither in regard of traffic which there flourish above measure especial in the city of Alexandria and cairo by reason that this kingdom be most commodious

for these 1000 year follow the heresy of Eutiches which allow but of one nature in Christ by which heresy they also separate and dismember themselves from the union of the church of Europe the occasion of this separation and (@) be the Ephesine council assemble by dioscorus in defence of Eutiches who be now condemn in the Chalcedon counsel by six hundred and thirty father congregate together by the authority of Leo the first for the cofti fear that to attribute two nature unto Christ may be all one as if they have assign he two hypostasis or person to avoid the heresy of the nestorian they become eutichian they say their divine service in the chaldean tongue oftentimes repeat alleluia they read the gospel first in chaldean and then in arabic when the priest say the young

knowledge of tongue and long practice in the affair of the world join with wonder eloquence and presence of body be in great esteem and reputation not only among the christian but also with the turk

who be advertise of all this business take the matter quick in hand write unto the two priest appoint one of they to go direct to cairo and the other to return back to Rome wherefore in the year 1582 in the month of October one of the say priest arrive at cairo be courteous receive by Mariani and afterward conduct to the patriarch who also make show of great joy and consolation one may likewise perceive a reasonable disposition in other who have any authority among the cofti he advertise the pope of all who send a certain other priest with one brief to the patriarch and a other to the jesuit wherein he exhort they to go forward and to bring the union whereof so assure hope be conceive to good effect the patriarch receive the brief with great reverence he kiss it and according to their custom lay it upon his head and afterward demand what it comprehend the which with great feeling and contentment have understand within few day he institute a synod of some bishop and certain other principal person of the nation here the say priest have declare unto they upon how little ground they who at the first receive the faith from saint mark be sequester from the western church by the authority of one heretic take much pain afterward in make they capable of the difference that be between a nature and a or person to their exceed great admiration because they be in a manner destitute of all learning for the patriarch even from his youth have lead his life in the monastery of saint Macarius far not only from the study of learning but also from the conversation of man neither appear there any great knowledge in the bishop they have (@) any book of the ancient father and yet those they have be all dusty and eat with moth that where of they make chief account be a old volume be tear and rend which they call the confession of the father full of diverse dream and fable whereof notwithstanding and of some other arabic book the priest make special good use for the convince of they in their error also have frame a compendium of most necessary doctrine they cause diverse copy of the same to be draw and give they to the learned of the cofti to be consider of who wonder at the strangeness of the thing propound unto they and not know how to answer the argument of the priest demand time to search their own write and to see what opinion their predecessor have hold as concern that point in the mean while they come often to the priest and inquire of they the doctrine and form of speech use in the romish church whereupon they show they how great the same church have ever detest heresy and how severe it have condemn the impiety of Nestorius and contrariwise high esteem the authority of cyrillus alexandrinus and the decree of the first Ephesine council neither because it confess two nature in Christ join in one person without confusion do it therefore infer two or person in that a nature and a person be not the self same thing the which may clear be understand by the deep mystery of the holy trinity wherein we acknowledge one nature and three or person we aver therefore that there be two nature in Christ one divine which he have eternal from his father the other human which he take temporal from the immaculate womb of his mother both of they join in one or person by these and other like demonstration they clear the understand and confirm the mind of the cofti howbeit all this notwithstanding the synod be again assemble wherein be present the patriarch five bishop diverse abbot of monastery and thirty other principal person they plain answer the priest that they have turn over their annal and write and be resolve in no wise to depart from the doctrine and faith of their predecessor this unlooked-for answer though it great trouble and displease the priest yet be they determine still to continue and to proceed further in the enterprise whereupon declare unto they again how far they be by dioscorus mean estrange from the doctrine teach in the Nicen constantinopolitan and first Ephesine counsel ground on the authority of holy scripture and the ancient father and that to disallow of two nature in Christ be no other but to deny that he be neither true god nor man a matter abominable not only to their ear but even to their very understanding they prevail so much as that the matter be yet defer off to a other month be therefore congregate the three time it seem that God himself further this affair more than usual for first with common consent they abrogate the law of circumcision and withal after a disputation of six hour continuance it be decree that as concern the truth of this point the priest be to be believe that there be two nature in Christ and that the cofti though they avoid the name and title of two nature yet deny they not but that Christ be true man and true God only they be wary of the two nature for fear of fall by little and little into two hypostasis thus this business be bring to so good a pass be by the ambition and obstinacy of one man utter cross and hinder this be the vicar or Suffragan to the patriarch who aspire himself to the patriarkship and see that if he follow this union begin with the roman church he can not attain to that dignity but by the pope authority which he altogether misdoubt he first make the decree of two nature to be defer command afterward that none shall subscribe thereunto and final cause the patriarch whole to give over this business and to retire himself into the wilderness whereas he continue for certain month afterward the priest understand where he be write unto he a letter signify therein what a special desire they have to see he and what damage the retire of himself will procure to the silly sheep recommend unto he by God if he ratify not full those thing which be decree upon in the last assembly he courteous answer make show that he will return when he have visit his diocese and in the mean while they shall expect he at cairo but while he think upon return his own death interrupt he the cofti have a law or custom that between the death of one patriarch and the creation of a other there must be in a manner a whole year space for so long it be requisite say they that the church shall bewail the death of her spouse whereupon the priest not to loose so much time determine to go home into Italy to acquaint the pope with the success of all thing and afterward need so require to return the cofti understand thus much write letter to the pope wherein they partly thank he for the care he have of they and partly lament that their reconciliation with the romish church be not full confirm and finish while the priest be about to depart on saint Mathewes day in the morning there come a rout of arm turk to their lodging these lay hand sudden on two priest and another companion of they and on three friar of the order of saint Francis lodge in the same house no man know the reason of this hurly-burly but for as much as can be learn all this grow through the envy of a Frenchman this man aspire to the degree of consul or governor over his nation which Mariani have obtain malicious give the bassa of cairo to understand that Mariani suborn the people against the grand signior and that he have order from the k. of Spain to levy christian man and that to this end he keep in his house certain priest who practise in this behalf with Mariani for the king there be nothing that more prejudice the priest than the Cofties letter which breed a vehement suspicion in the turk that such a union may be conclude with the roman church as may work some extraordinary innovation they be therefore cast into a filthy and stink prison the venetian consul assay first by word of mouth and after by suit and supplication to assuage the fury and anger of the Bassa howbeit he receive such bitter and nip answer that he himself be also afraid but nothing prevail further with the turk than money for it seem that with this only their savage fury be mitigate and their fierceness appease five thousand crown therefore be disburse for the priest liberty wherein the cofti show themselves very friendly the rich of they offer one after another to lend money without any interest for the same but this matter cost Mariani more than ten thousand crown and beside that he be deprive of his degree of consulship the priest be thus free out of prison and observe how thing go return one after another back to Rome a relation touch the state of christian religion in the dominion of Prete janni take out of a oration of Matthew Dresserus professor of the greek and latin tongue and of history in the university of Lipsia who have first make a general exordium to his auditory proceed at length to the peculiar handle of the foresay argument in manner follow say he etc. the space of one hundred year be not as yet full expire since the fame of the ethiopian religion come first unto our ear which because it be in many point agreeable unto christian verity and carry a honest show of piety therewith be to be esteem as a matter most worthy of our knowledge of this therefore so far forth as the short time of a oration will permit I purpose to entreat to the end it may appear both where and what manner of christian church that of Ethiopia be and what be the first beginning thereof this ethiopian not unfit call * * * * *

they be exalt and advance above other people and this be a common name to all the Christian king of Ethiopia as Pharaoh be to the egyptian king and Augustus to the roman emperor neither be this precious John a priest by profession but a civil magistrate nor be he arm so much with religion and law as with military force howbeit he call himself the pillar of faith because he be the maintainer of the christian faith not only enjoin his own subject to the observation thereof but what in he lie enforce his enemy also to embrace it in time past Ethiopia be govern by queen only whereupon we read in the history of the old testament that the queen of the south come to king Solomon from Saba to hear his admirable wisdom about the year of the world 2954. the name of this queen as the ethiopian report be Maqueda who from the head-city of Ethiopia call Saba which like a isle be environ on all side by the river Nilus travel by Egypt and the red sea to jerusalem and she bring unto Solomon a hundred and twenty talent of gold which amount to 720000. golden ducat of Hungary that be seven ton of gold and 20000 hungarian ducat beside this mighty sum of gold with other thing of great value she present unto Solomon who likewise requite she with most princely gift she contend with he also in propound of sage question and obscure riddle among other matter as it be report by cedrenus she bring before he certain damosel and young man in maid attire ask the king how he can discern one sex from another he answer that he will find they out by the wash of their face and forthwith he command all their face to be wash and they which wash themselves strong be find to be male but the residue by their tender wash bewray themselves to be damosel the ethiopian king suppose that they be descend from the lineage of David and from the family of Solomon and therefore they use to term themselves the son of David and of Solomon and of the holy patriarch also as be spring from their progeny for queen Maqueda say they have a son by Solomon who they name Meilech but afterward he be call David this Meilech as they report be grow to twenty year of age be send back by his mother unto his father and instructor Solomon that he may learn of he wisdom and understanding which so soon as the say Meilech or David have attain by the permission of Solomon take with he many priest and noble out of all the twelve tribe he return to his kingdom of Ethiopia and take upon he the government thereof as likewise he carry home with he the law of God and the rite of circumcision these be the beginning of the jewish religion in Ethiopia and it be report that even till this present none be admit into any ministry or canonship in the court but such as be descend of their race that come first out of iury. by these therefore the doctrine of God in Ethiopia be first plant which afterward take such deep root as it have since remain to all succeed age for the ethiopian do both retain the book of the prophet and travail also to jerusalem that they may there worship the true God reveal in the kingdom of Israel which manifest appear act of the apost cap. 8. verse 26. out of the history of the ethiopian eunuch who name be Indich which be a principal governor under queen Candaces proper call judith for he about the ten year after the death and resurrection of our bless saviour travail for the space of two hundred and forty mile to jerusalem where have perform due worship unto God return homeward as he sit in his chariot he read the prophet esaias and by the commandment of the holy spirit philip one of Christ his disciple be send unto he and when they be both come to the city Bethzur three mile distant from jerusalem the eunuch at the foot of a mountain espy a certain water wherein he be baptize by philip. and be return into Ethiopia this eunuch baptize the queen and a great part of her family and people from which time the ethiopian begin to be christian who since that have continual profess the christian faith they believe also that Philip send into Ethiopia a disciple of his call lycanon who as they suppose ordain the very form of religion which they now hold now these beginning aswell of the jewish as the Christian religion among the ethiopian be thus declare we be next to entreat of the doctrine and religion itself together with the rite and ceremony use at this present in the ethiopicke church so far forth as we can gather out of the ambassage which have be perform from these part thither and back again beside which there be no history nor discourse of any worth to be find which entreat of the religion manner and custom of the ethiopian so as it be a matter very strange that for so many hundred year together Ethiopia be so bar from our knowledge that we have not so much as any report thereof until about the year of our lord 1440. certain ambassador send from thence to pope Eugenius return back with his letter and papal benediction to their king which letter be most chary keep among the record of this ethiopian king and be preserve for perpetual monument from which time also as though Ethiopia have be again choir debar from the knowledge and conversation of our man there be not any european that go into Ethiopia nor any ethiopian that come into Europe till the year of our lord 1486. what time John the second king of Portugal send Pedro de Covilham and alonco de to search out Ethiopia this Pedro be a man very learned eloquent skilful in sundry language painful in his endeavour fortunate in his attempt and most desirous to find out new country and people both by sea and land he therefore in the year above mention together with his companion alonco de (@) who die in the voyage travail first to Alexandria and cairo in Egypt from whence in the company of certain moor of Fez and tremizen he proceed on to el Tor a haven town upon the arabian shore of the red sea and thence to aden situate without the entrance of the arabian gulf where have embark himself in a ship of moor he travail to Calicut goa and other place of the east indies and be full inform of the state of the spicery he cross over the main ocean to cofala sail thence to Ormuz and then return back to cairo from whence have dispatch letter unto his king in the company of rabbi joseph a jew he make a second voyage to Ormuz and in his return he take his journey towards Ethiopia the emperor whereof at that time be call Alexander unto who when he have deliver a letter and a map of the world send from king John he be most kind entertain and reward with many rich gift and albeit he most earnest desire to return into his own country yet can he never obtain leave but have wealth honour and a wife of a noble family bestow upon he to assuage his desire of return home wherefore in the year 1526. which be forty year after his departure out of Portugal he be leave by rodrigo de lima the Portugal ambassador still remain in the court of Prete janni in all this mean while sundry portugal come out of India to the court of the Prete not so much to visit and salute he as to declare the good will and kind affection of their king towards he whereupon queen Helena which be then protectress of the ethiopian or Abassin empire to requite the king of Portugal with like friendship send unto he in the company of the foresay portugal a ambassador or messenger of she call Matthew who be a merchant bear in Armenia be a man skilful in matthew the first ambassador send from Aethiopia to Portugal sundry language and in many other matter this Matthew she not only furnish with letter requisite for such a ambassage but enjoin he also to declare by word of mouth unto the king of Portugal the principal head of their doctrine or belief together with their rite

with many other token and pledge of mutual Christian amity thus Matthew be dismiss take his journey to the east indies from whence he be conduct by sea into Portugal where arrive in the year 1513 he

year in the court and country of Ethiopia take there most diligent notice of all matter worthy the observation and he have often and familiar conference not only with the emperor himself but also with the patriarch concern the whole state of their religion and of matter ecclesiastical as also he be a most curious observer of all their rite and ceremony who in the year of Christ 1526. being dismiss by Prete janni be accompany into Zagazabo the second ambassador send from AEthiopia to Portugal Portugal by another ethiopian or Abassin ambassador call Zagazabo and bring letter also to pope Clement the seven with a golden cross of a pound weight it seem likewise that the say ambassador of Prete janni be a very honest upright and godly man who by reason of their continual war be detain in Portugal till the year of our lord 1539. the letter of Prete janni to the pope be by Francis Aluarez deliver at Bononia in the year of Christ 1533. where in the presence of Charles the emperor and before a mighty assembly of people they be read and approve with great joy and acclamation both which letter as well to the pope as to the king don Emanuel be full of christian piety and love wherein first that mighty emperor though therein he be deceive with singular reverence and duty submit himself unto the pope of Rome as to the head of all the church offer by the say Francis most humble obedience after the manner of other christian prince as likewise he proffer unto they both the office of benevolence charity and true friendship intend to join a firm league of amity with they and signify that his dominion be free and open to all christian that will by sea or land frequent the same also he plain seem to detest the mutual discord of christian exhort they to bandy their force against the mahometan and promise his royal assistance and most earnest endeavour for the vanquish of Christ enemy and their conversion to the truth last he require that man of learning and of skill in the holy scripture as likewise diligent printer and all sort of artificer may be send he to be employ in the service of his church and common wealth signify that he will not violent detain any man in his dominion but will dismiss he into his own country with honour and liberal reward and that he may testify his love and kind affection to the king of Portugal by a most worthy monument he send he the crown off his own head as the present of (@) dutiful son to his most dear father wherefore by this most admirable diligence and industry of the portugal Ethiopia in these last time have be discover and make know unto we neither be there any thing in the ethiopian religion so hide and unrevealed which have not either be find out by Francis Aluarez or most large declare by Zagazabo the ethiopian ambassador out of the relation therefore of these two worthy author as out of a fountain we will derive the whole substance of our speech the ground of the ethiopicke religion be the

or extenuate their first baptism but that every year they may receive a new absolution from their sin also unto their infant upon the very day of their baptism they give the body of our lord under a small morsel of bread but such as be grow to year of discretion before they come unto the lord holy supper do make confession and receive absolution of all their sin from the priest then do they all

the rest his special duty be to give holy order to administer church-discipline and to excommunicate contumace or obstinate offender which be for their stubbornness famish to death but the authority of give bishopric and spiritual benefice the emperor reserve to himself in Ethiopia there be infinite number of priest and of monk Francis Aluarez see at one time ordain by the patriarch two thousand three hundred fifty six priest and the like manner of ordain or instalment they have every year twice it seem that those which be choose into that order be man destitute of learning and liberal art unto their priesthood none be admit before he be full thirty year of age it fall out likewise that during the vacation of the patriarkship the church have great want of priest which vacation be often time prolong by reason of the continual war between the christian and the border mahumetan and gentile whereby all passage from Ethiopia to the monk of jerusalem be quite cut off hence proceed great desolation in that church but with monk all place in this Abassin empire do mighty swarm these do not only confine themselves in monastery whereof here be great number but also take upon they office in the court and entangle themselves in military affair and in buy and sell of merchandise neither be there any kind of people in those eastern part more conversant in trade of merchandise than priest (@) monk so that the old say saw be most true verify what ere the world do put in ure the monk will intermeddle sure it be (@) to be note that the priest monk and other minister of (@) ethiopian church be not maintain by tithe and alm as they be in Europe they have only certain field and garden which must be manure by the monk and clergy themselves to beg aught of the common people they be in no wise permit unless perhaps some man will of his own accord bestow somewhat in their church for the exequy of the dead or for some other sacred use these ethiopian have a certain book which they suppose to have be write by all the apostle when they be assemble at jerusalem this book in their language they call Manda and Abetilis and do believe that all thing therein contain be to be hold for gospel in it among other matter be contain certain penal statute as for example if a priest be convict of adultery manslaughter robbery or perjury he be to receive like punishment with other malefactor likewise that aswell ecclesiastical as secular person be to abstain from come to church for the space of four and twenty hour after carnal copulation some law also there be concern the purification of woman after their month and their childbirth which because we can make but little use of they I do here pass over in silence one thing there be in this book very well provide namely that twice every year there be a synod assemble in the church of Christ for the handle and discuss of all matter ecclesiastical these be the principal point of the religion faith and ceremony of the ethiopicke church under Prete janni which hitherto have come to our knowledge a good part whereofis agreeable unto the scripture of the old and new testament and such in very deed they be as represent unto we the acknowledgement of one true God and the faith and worship of our only lord and saviour jesus Christ but as never any church upon earth be quite void of blemish so neither be this of Ethiopia free from all stain of error which notwithstanding may seem the less strange because in Ethiopia there be no school nor seminary of liberal art save only that the priest themselves according to their simple skill train up their son unto such learning as may in time make they capable of priesthood neither be there ever any man yet that reform their error Francis Aluarez report that the patriarch of this ethiopic church in a certain private conference do grievous complain of all such error as be there maintain and be most earnest desirous of a reformation which desire of he as it be most holy and commendable so be it by all christian to be approve god almighty grant that the ethiopian may one day attain to the accomplishment of this his compassionate well-wishing and may have a happy reformation of their church for this to desire and pray for be far more convenient and christian-like then to disgrace they with reproachful word and to bereave they of the name of christian which hard and unchristian measure Zagazabo the ethiopian ambassador report with grief that he find among the popish priest of Portugal by who he be quite restrain from the use and communion of the (@) supper as ifhe have be a mere Gentile or anathema it be indeed a error or rather a great infirmity that they do as yet retain and use some of the jewish ceremony but we be (@) to impute it to their ignorance of christian liberty and whereas they permit marriage to their priest it be neither repugnant to the sacred word of God nor to the institution of the apostle wherefore it ought not to be disallow of any christian unless they will prefer the decree of the pope before the commandment of God establish by Christ and his apostle whereby it may plain appear how impious and savage the priest of Portugal deal in that especial for this cause they so sharp inney against the ethiopic ambassador and so uncivil entreat he their yearly renew ofbaptisme be at the first bring in by error and since by ancient use and tradition have grow authentical for in very deed so great be the force of antiquity and custom that where they once take root they can hardly be remove and it be a wonder that the ethiopian do so often repeat baptism when as they can be circumcise any more than once but in regard of all these defect what can we better devise to do then in our daily prayer to wish they mind better inform and the purity and integrity of faith which be agreeable unto god word the ethiopian conceive exceed joy at the first arrival of the portugal in their country hope that their mutual acquaintance and familiarity will breed a similitude and conjunction as well of their religion as of their affection and mind but I be very afraid lest the reproachful and stern carriage of the popish priest and monk towards the ethiopic ambassador before mention have more than ever in time past estrange the mind of that nation from the christian of Europe howbeit the singular care and industry of those two renown prince John the second and Emanuel king of Portugal be most high to be extol and celebrate who by infinite charge employ upon their navigation to the east indies and to these part have open a way for the european christian to the southern church of Ethiopia and for the ethiopian to this western church of Europe which have not these two worthy prince bring to effect we shall not so much as have know the name of a christian church in Ethiopia for thither by the way of Arabia and Egypt in regard of the arabian and mahometan most deadly enmity to the christian faith it be so dangerous and difficult to travel as it seem to be quite bar and shut up unless therefore over the atlantike Ethiopick and indian sea the portugal have thither find a passage by navigation it have almost be impossible for any ambassador or other person to have come out of Ethiopia into these western part thus (@) Matthew Dresserus a ambassage send from pope Paul the four to Claudius the emperor of Abassia or the high Ethiopia for plant of the religion and ceremony of the church of Rome in his dominion which ambassage take none effect at all in the year 1555 John the three king of Portugal determine to leave no mean unattempted for the absolute reconciliation of Prete janni unto the church of Rome for though David ambassador have perform obedience to pope Clement the seven on his emperor behalf yet doubt the king of Portugal as true it be that for want of speedy prosecution those forward beginning will prove but altogether fruitless in that for all this they still embrace the heresy of dioscorus and Eutiches and depend on the authority of the patriarch of Alexandria receive their Abuna from he who be the sole arbitrator of all their matter ecclesiastical the of their sacrament the giver of order over all Ethiopia master of their ceremony and instructor of their faith whereupon he suppose that he can not do any thing more profitable or necessary then to send thither a patriarch appoint at Rome who may exercise spiritual authority over they as also with he some priest of singular integrity and learning who with their sermon disputation and discourse both public and private may reduce those people from their error and heresy to the truth and may confirm and strengthen they in the same and unto this it seem a wide gate be already open because not many year before Claudius the emperor of Ethiopia receive great succour from the portugal against Graadamet king of Zeila who have bring he to a hard point and in a letter write from he to Stephen gama he call Christopher gama his brother who die in this war by the reverend name of a martyr the king of Portugal therefore have impart this his resolution first with pope julius the three and then with Paul the four it be by they conclude to send into Ethiopia thirteen priest man of principal estimation and account above other of their quality John nun Barretto be make patriarch and there be join unto he two assist bishop Melchior Carnero and Andrea under title of the bishop of Nicaea and hierapolis king John set forth this ambassage not only with whatsoever the voyage itself necessary require but further with all royal preparation and rich present for Prete janni nevertheless the better to lay open a entrance for the patriarch there be by the king appointment send before from the city of goa jago Dias and with he gonsaluo rodrigo into Ethiopia to discover the mind of the neguz and the disposition of his people these two be admit to the presence of that prince show he the letter of king John wherein he congratulate with he on the behalf of all christian for that follow the example of his grandfather and father he have embrace the christian faith and union whereat Claudius be amaze ' as at a thing never before think of and the emperor of Ethiopia will by no mean admit the supremacy and religion of the romish church it be demand why he have write to the king of Portugal to that effect he excuse himself by the writer and interpreter of his letter add thereunto that though he esteem that king as his very good brother yet be he never mind to swerve one jot from the faith of his predecessor Roderigo for all this be no whit daunt but wrought all mean to bring Claudius to his opinion but the great difficulty against this his busy enterprise be the ignorance of the emperor and the prince of Ethiopia in all the general counsel and ancient history afterward perceive that the neguz do not willing admit he to audience he write and divulge a book in the chaldean tongue wherein confute the opinion of the the abassin he labour mighty to advance the authority of the roman church which book raise so great a tumult that the emperor to avoid worse inconvenience which be likely to ensue be fain quick to suppress it jago Dias perceive that he do but loose time and the term of his return approach take his leave of the neguz and have make know in goa how matter stand it be not think requisite that the patriarch shall expose his own person together with the reputation of the roman church unto so great hazard but rather not whole to abandon the enterprise they determine to send thither Andrew Ouiedo new elect bishop of hierapolis with two or three assistant who with great authority may debate of that which Roderigo already have so unfruitful treat of Ouiedo most willing undertake this attempt put himself on the voyage with father Emanuel fernandez and some few other when he be come into Abassia he stand in more need of patience than disputation for king Claudius within a few month after be vanquish and Adamas a new emperor of Ethiopia slay Adamas his brother succeed who be a great enemy to the sea of Rome this man draw (@) and his assistant to the war with he and entreat they most barbarous as also those abassin who they have convert he likewise be afterward overthrow in battle by the turk who strip Ouiedo and his companion of all thing that they have whereupon they grow into such poverty and misery as all help fail they they be enforce to get their live with the plough and spade till they all die one after another this ethiopian christianity be bring at this day to a hard point by the invasion of the turk and moor as be before declare notwithstanding their religious man affirm that they have prophecy of the come of a christian nation to their port from far country with who they shall go to the destruction of the moor and these they hold to be Portugal they have far certain presagement of saint Sinoda who be a egyptain hermite of the ruin of Mecca the recovery of the holy sepulchre and the take of Egypt and cairo by the abassin unite with the latin of the christian of the isle of Socotera vicinity of place and conformity of custom invite i to cross the sea and to visit the christian of Socotera this island be sixty mile long and five and twenty in breadth it be situate over against the red sea the people thereof receive the faith from saint Thomas the apostle for they affirm that here he suffer shipwreck and that of the break and batter ship he build a church which be as yet extant they imitate for the most part the rite custom and fashion of the abassin but with great ignorance and error for be separate from all commerce with the christian of these part they remain deprive of that spiritual help which the western church by communication may impart unto they they retain circumcision and some other moisaicall ceremony also they pray for the dead and observe ordinary fast have prefix hour for prayer and bear great reverence to their religion in honour whereof they build chapel wherein assemble together with a high and loud voice they make supplication and prayer in the Hebrew tongue but their far distance as I say from these part of Christendom the sterility of the island and the poverty of the people be occasion that the little light of truth which they have be in a manner quite eclipse by multitude of error unto other thing may be add the tyranny of the king of Fartac a mahometan who subdue Fartac a country of Arabia Felix the king whereof subdue the isle of Zocotera 1482. they about the year of our lord 1482. and partly by dominion partly by affinity and kindred and partly also by conversation bring in among they the deadly poison of Mahumet from this servitude they be deliver by Tristan Acunna one of the king of portugal captain six and twenty year after they fall into the same and for their better security he repair the fortress leave therein a Portugal garrison but because the charge far surmount any benefit that come of the island not long after the say fortress be ruinate and the island abandon by the portugal John the three king of Portugal have a great desire to assist and free they from the tyranny of the turk whereunto after the take of aden they be subject but for fear of provoke the great Turk or give he occasion to disturb and molest those sea with his fleet as also for the dispatch of other affair he have in hand he never go about that enterprise of the christian of Nubia Aluarez in his aethiopicke relation write that he be at the court of Prete janni there arrive certain ambassador from Nubia to make (@) unto that prince for some priest and minister of the gospel and sacrament by who they may be instruct in the christian faith but Prete janni answer they that he have not enough for his own country whereupon they return home very discontent so that have no help from the christian and on the otherside be daily solicit by the mahometan upon who they border on many side it be think that at this present they remain in a manner without any religion at all notwithstanding at this day there be more than a hundred and fifty church stand with diverse other note and sign of Christianity their language partake much with the egyptain and no less with the chaldean and arabic of the christian in the king doom of congo hitherto

the king put he to flight who not be secure in the head city abandon his kingdom and together with the Portugal priest and his own prince retire himself unto a island of the river Zaire call the isle of horse thus see himself bring to such extremity for beside the loss of his kingdom his people die of famine and misery and for maintenance of life sell themselves one to another and to the portugal also at a base price for reparation of his state and religion he have recourse to don Sebastian king of Portugal and obtain of he six hundred soldier by who valour he drive his enemy out of the

which have be long time give over and forsake these man have build they a house in the island of Loanda where do remain six or seven of their company that be ready to go sometime hither and sometime thither as need require in the year of our lord 1587. king Alvaro who because he be not bear of lawful matrimony be but little esteem by his people will needs have one of these priest about he by who mean and authority he come to reputation and credit and God himself favour his proceed for meet a sister of he by the father side and one of her brother with a great army in the field he give he battle and bear himself therein with such valour as he do not only overthrow the force of his enime but further slay the ringleader and general thereof and in the place where he be slay he will needs build a church to the honour of Christianity and the more by his own example to move other himself be the very first man that put hand to this work and likewise with edict and favourable proclamation he further and do still advance the preach of the gospel and the propagation of religion who so be desirous to be more full instruct concern the christianity of this kingdom let he read the three and eight book of Osorius reb. gest Eman. and the second book of Philippo Pigafetta his story of congo most proper and decent translate by the judicious master Abraham Hartwell of the christian religion in the kingdom of angola those Portugal priest that remain in the island Loanda as above we declare bend themselves more to the conversion of angola then of congo the reason be as I suppose because the enterprise be new and more near concern the portugal who there make war under the conduct of Paulo diaz to get possession of the mountain of cabambe which abound with rich mine of very fine silver it seem that god have favour the amplification of his holy name in those part with some miraculous victory for first in the year 1582 a few portugal in a excursion that they make put to flight a innumerable company of the Angolans and by this victory they bring in a manner the half of that kingdom into their hand and many prince and noble of the land upon this be move to request and make suit to be baptize among who be Songa prince of Banza the king father in law who brother and child be baptize already Tondella also the second person of angola be convert many idol be throw to the ground and instead thereof they erect cross and build some church and within this little while all the province of Corimba be in a manner convert also in the year 1584. a hundred and fifty portugal together with such succour as be conduct by Paul prince of angola who be not long before convert discomfit more than a million of ethiopian in a other place we declare the ready mean and opportunity that the prince of Ethiopia and of India have to assemble and bring together such infinite army they say that certain ethiopian be demand by a Portugal how it come to pass that so great a multitude turn their back to so few man they answer that the portugal strength do it not which with a blast they will have confound but a woman of incomparable beauty apparel in shine light and brightness and a old man that keep her company with a flame sword in his hand who go aloft in the air before the portugal and overthrow the squadron of the Angolans put they to flight and destruction in the year 1588. be convert don Paulo prince of Mocumba and with he a thousand person more the christian religion of Monomotapa in the dominion of the Monomotapa the light of the faith be with incredible ease kindle be also as sudden (@) by the device of the mahometan for some portugal go to the court of that monarch and give himself with some of his prince and vassal a taste of the gospel be a occasion afterward that gonsaluo de Sylva a man no less famous for the integrity of his life then for his blood and parentage go over thither from goa in the year 1570. this man arrive with a prosperous voyage in the kingdom of Inambane convert and baptize the king his wife child and sister with his baron and nobility and the great part of his people through who persuasion gonsaluo leave his companion prosecute his voyage towards the Monomotapa only with six portugal thus have pass mozambique and the mouth of the river and of colimane they come to Mengoaxano king of Quiloa where they be courteous receivedand entertain and though they have licence in this place to preach the gospel yet will not gonsaluo here stay judge that upon the conversion of the Monomotapa that of the neighbour king will follow without delay embark themselves therefore upon the river Cuama they sail along the coast of Africa eight day till they come to Sena a very populous village where gonsaluo baptize about five hundred slave belong to the Portugal merchant and prepare for the receive of the gospel the king of inamor one of the monomotapaes vassal in the end Antonio Caiado a Portugal gentleman come from the court to guide gonsaluo towards the same place whither be in short time come he be present visit on the emperor behalf and bountiful present with a great sum of gold and many ox but he return back these present give the Monomotapa to understand that he shall know of Caiado what he desire the emperor be astonish at this his magnanimity and receive he afterward with the great honour that can possible be devise and cause he to sit upon the same carpet whereon also his own mother sit he present demand how many woman how much ground and how many ox thing mighty esteem of in those country he will have gonsaluo answer that he will have no other thing but himself whereupon the emperor turn to Caiado who be their interpreter say that sure it can not be otherwise but that he who make so little account of thing so high value by other be no ordinary man and so with much courtesy he send he back to his lodging not long time after the emperor let gonsaluo to understand that he and his mother be resolve to become christian and that therefore he shall come to baptize they but he to instruct they better in the faith defer it off for some day final five and twenty day after his arrival with unspeakable (@) and preparation he give the water of baptism to the king and to his mother he be call Sebastian and she maria. and present after about three hundred of the principal in this emperor court be baptize gonsaluo for his wonderful abstinence charity wisdom and for many other his singular virtue be so reverence and esteem by those people as if he have come down from heaven among they now as matter proceed thus prosperous and with so desirable success behold a horrible tempest arise which drown the ship there be in the court four mahometan most dear unto the king these man find out some occasion suggest unto he that gonsaluo be a magioian who by witchcraft and (@) can turn kingdom topsy-turvy and that he be come to pry into his estate and to stir up his people to rebellion and so by this mean to bring his kingdom under subjection to the portugal with these and such like suggestion they bring the king who be but a young man to determine the death of gonsaluo the effect whereof be that after long prayer repose himself a little he be by eight of the king servant slay and his body throw into the river near unto the same place be with like violence put to death fifty new-conuerted christian this rage and fury be over the king be advertise by the principal of his kingdom and then by the portugal of the excess and outrage he have therein commit he excuse himself the best he can cause those mahometan to be slay who have seduce he and he seek out some other also who lay hide to put they to death whereupon it seem that by the death of father gonsaluo the conversion of this great king and of his empire shall have be further and no whit hinder if the portugal will rather have prevail by the word of God then by force of arm the which I say because instead of send new preacher into those country to preserve that which be already get and to make new conversion they resolve to revenge themselves by war there depart therefore out of Portugal a good fleet with a great number of noble portugal therein conduct by Francisco Barretto at the fame of this war move against he the Monomotapa full of fear send to demand peace of Barretto but he aspire to the infinite mine of gold in that kingdom contemn all condition offer he the effect of this enterprise be that this army which be so terrible to a mighty monarch be in few day consume by the intemperature of the air which be there insupportable to the people of Europe of the fortress and colony maintain by the spaniard and portugal upon the main of Africa by mean whereof the christian religion have there some small foot which albeit in other respect they have be mention before yet here also in this one regard it seem not from our purpose brief to remember they to the propagation of Christianity those fortress and colony wonderful help which the castilian but much more the portugal have plant on the coast of Africa for they serve very fit either to convert infidel upon diverse occasion or by get a habit of their language and custom to make a more easy way to their conversion for those who be not sufficient to preach serve for interpreter to the preacher and thus God have oftentimes be well serve and with excellent fruit and effect by the endeavour of some soldier on the coast of Africa upon the Mediterran sea the spaniard have oran Mersalchibir Melilla etc. and the portugal Tanger and and without the straits of Gibraltar Arzilla and mazagan and in Ethiopia saint George they have also a settle habitation in the city of saint Saluador the metropolitan of the kingdom of congo and in Cumbiba a country of angola beyond the cape they hold the fortress and colony of Sena Cefala and Mozambiche here beside their secular clergy be a convent of dominican who endeavour themselves to instruct the portugal and the pagan also which there inhabit and do traffic thither of the island of the atlantic ocean where the spaniard and portugal have plant religion the christian name be also augment and do still increase in the atlantic ocean by mean of the colony conduct thither partly by the spaniard and partly by the portugal the spaniard undertake the enterprise of the canary in the year of our lord 1405. use therein the assistance of John Betancort a french gentleman who subdue Lancarota and Fuerteventura they be take again certain year after and be first subdue by force of arm and afterward by the establishment of religion so that at this present all the inhabitant be christian also the portugal have assay to inhabit certain other island of that ocean and especial madera which be discover in the year 1420. this at the first be all over a thick and mighty wood but now it be one of the best manure island that be know there be in the same the city of funcial be the seat of a bishop puerto santo which be forty mile distant from madera be find out in the year 1428. and this also begin present to be inhabit the isle of Arguin be six or seven and all but little one come to the knowledge of the portugal in the year 1443. here the king have a fortress for the traffic of those country the island of cabo Verde be discover in the year 1440. by Antonio Nolli a genoese or as other affirm in the year 1455. by Cadamosto these be nine in number the principal of they be Sant jago be seventy mile in length where the portugal have a town situate upon a most pleasant river call ribera which consist at (@) least of five hundred family the isle of saint Thomas be somewhat great than madera be the last island discover by the portugal before they double the cape Esperanca they have here a colony call Povasaon with a bishop who be also the bishop of congo and it contain seven hundred family under the government of saint Thomas be the neighbour island of Fernando Po and that which be as it be borough belong to the same the island Loanda though it be under the king of congo yet be a great part thereof inhabit by the portugal for here be the famous port of * * * * * *

the Portugal priest who endeavour the conversion of the natural inhabitant have a place of residence of the negro most of the island inhabit by the portugal especial those of saint Thomas and madera beside the portugal themselves contain a great multitude of negro-slave bring thither out of congo and angola who till the earth water the sugarcane and serve both in the city and in the country these be for the most part gentile but they be daily convert rather through continual conversation than any other help that they have and it be a matter likely that in process of some few year they will all become christian there be no great hindrance to their conversion than the avarice of their master who to hold they in the more subjection be not willing that they shall become christian of those poor distress european christian in Africa who be hold as slave unto the turk and moor but the best and most sincere christianity in all Africa be that of those poor christian who be fetter by the foot with chain be slave to the arabian and turk for beside they that have remain there ever since the day of Barbarossa and other turkish captain which be bring into the mediterran sea by the french as also since the great loss at Gerbi and the battle of Alcazar wherein don Sebastian the king of Portugal be overthrow there pass not a year but the rover and pirate of those part without grant any league or respite to the northern shore of the Mediterran sea take great number of christian from off the coast of Spain Sardinia Corsica Sicilia yea even from the very mouth of Tiber it be general think that the number of slave which be in alger amount to eighteen thousand in Tunis Bona and Biserta there be great multitude but many more in Fez and Maroco as likewise in Mequenez and Tarodant and in diverse other city of those kingdom the estate sure of these distress people be most worthy of compassion not so much for the misery wherein they lead their life as for the danger whereto their soul be subject they pass the day in continual travail and the great part of the night without repose or quiet under insupportable burden and cruel stripe beast among we labour not more nor be more

yet those of their mind be much more intolerable for beside that they want such as may feed they with the word of God and with the sacrament and may teach they how to live and die well so as they remain like plant without moisture it can not be express with whatforcible temptation their faith be continual assail for not only the desire to come forth of these unspeakable misery do tempt they but the commodity and delight also wherein they see other to live that have damnable renounce their christianity the persecutor of the primitive church to induce the martyr to deny Christ and to

hunger famine blow reproach and torture without any hope in a manner ever to come out thereof and on the other side they see they that have renege our holy faith for mahumets superstition to live in all worldly prosperity and delight to abound with wealth to flourish in honour to govern city to conduct army and to enjoy most ample liberty but amid all these so great misery they have a double comfort the one be of priest who together with themselves be take captive these man sometime administer the sacrament and other while deliver the word of God in the best manner that they can be some
