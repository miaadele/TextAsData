a Panegyrique of congratulation for the concord of the realm of great Britain in unity of religion under one King a ancient writer say that the ground and maintenance of all monarchy and empire be concord their ruin and subversion be discord the history of thing pass for sixteen hundred year since the eternal son of God and monarch of all monarch become man to redeem such as shall believe in he show we many fair and admirable blessing which God have pour upon the land of great Britain and the plant of christian truth in they the which I will represent unto your majesty to show plain that the concord and union of the people and nation over who God have make you king be the accomplishment and perfection of all the precedent benefit which his divine bounty have bestow upon the people under your most happy government the apostle saint Peter in his first catholic epistle the second chapter say that christian be a choose race a royal priesthood a holy nation a people purchase to God as his own the which be very fit apply to the people under your command see that God have first unite they under this royalty and priesthood of christian verity and afterwards have use this union of their soul as a mother to bring forth the union of three realm under your majesty in one royalty the say apostle in the same place do teach we to what end God have place we in this happy concord that be to the end say he that you shall declare his virtue who have call you out of darkness to his admirable light the which shall move we to prefer the wonderful work of God before all worldly thing who have free and redeem we from darkness from invocation and adoration of dead man and from pagan idolatry wherein our predecessor have be so long abuse worship image and the visible form of creature as the creator himself and the creature instead of the creator have since and in this latter age call and inspire we to worship he the only creator of all thing moreover the apostle in the same place do show we what man be before that be before you be no people and now you be the people of God you have not obtain mercy but now you have obtain mercy the people sire of the land of great Britain be not unite in religion in peace in concord in like affection and will under one king but they have be long band one against a other in a sea of discord dissension and cruel war against the decree and law of God for that they be out of christian charity have no other object in their soul but hatred and malice with a desire of revenge and so by consequence they be not God people but castaway by reason of their idolatry and spiritual fornication wherewith they be pollute and so unworthy to obtain mercy but now that the light of the gospel the true worship of one God have take lively and sure root in their heart under the fortunate reign of the decease queen and under your happy and lawful succession in these realm they be become of one heart of one affection and final be make the true people of God they have obtain blessing grace and mercy the comical poet say a king be the image of the live God Christian divinity teach we that in God there be three person unite in one deity essence and power saint Augustine compare the trinity to the three part of a man soul which be distinguish in operation and function unite in one and the same essence I beseech God sire so to work in the heart of your subject and in the three realm unite under the power and command of your royal majesty that be bind together they may represent the three person of the trinity in one deity and that agree in one will under your monarchy they may be make the true image of the heavenly that all may be one in Christ as Christ be one with his father it be never see in any age that the nation of the land of Brittany be unite in heart and affection under one king as the admirable power of God have late bring they under your majesty whereof the true and only cause be the purity and truth of christian religion the which God of his especial grace have miraculous plant in your realm and sense continue in you cause you to be bear the lawful and undoubted heir of these three ancient imperial crown of the west to reign christianly peaceable and happy as undoubted you shall see that God have endue and beautify you with learning in abundance and so great wisdom as I may just say these virtue surpass the greatness of your royal majesty if we examine the order of history we shall observe that this most happy union of english and scottish under one king have be long before foresee by the divine providence to be final effect in our age by the establishment of the ancient christian religion in your land and the abolishion of the new religion of arrius Nestorius and Eutichius bring in by the stratagem of the old serpent the spirit of error and darkness through the ministry of pope who since six hundred year under the name of Christianity have build up again this pagan idolatry have change the bishop and pastor of the church into worldly power usurp upon the king of the western empire in who soul through superstition and ignorance of the christian truth they have plant a more insupportable tyranny then that which ancient Rome have conquer by force of arm the great God of army have in your majesty person begin this happy union and concord betwixt two nation which have for so many age be in cruel and bloody war that you may employ the valour of their arm for the delivery of his church from the barbarous tyranny wherewith she have be long oppress by pope and as Constantine the great the protector and restorer of the ancient christian church be bear in great Britain and there begin his empire obtain afterwards admirable victory against four roman tyrant persecutor of the church of God by mean whereof he do abolish gentilism and plant christian religion at Rome and throughout the empire in like sort the same God have raise your majesty to the height of greatness to be successor unto Constantine in the say realm and to chase out of the same Rome the idolatry and abomination of the gentile the which Satan have sense bring in under the name of Christ which be the true mean to purchase you the just title of protector and defender of the faith and restorer of Christianity and as God by that marriage of Henry the seven with Elizabeth his wife make the union of the house of Lancaster and York who have a long time be in bloody war and by the marriage of james the four king of Scotland with marguerite the elder daughter of the say Henry the seven your great grandfather the conjunction of the crown of England and Scotland within these hundred year so we hope that the same god will employ this admirable union under your command to unite the christian and universal church under one spiritual royalty which be the worship of one God and to abolish idolatry which have in a manner swallow up and devour the true church my intention be to represent in brief unto your majesty and to all christian desirous of eternal health the infinite grace and benefit which God have pour upon your land in the plant and maintain the preach of his gospel that it may plain appear that neither the decease queen Elizabeth of happy memory nor your majesty have establish any new religion in your land but banish the new be pollute and defile with error and false worship of the gentile arian nestorian and Eutychian and that the religion which do now flourish in your realm be the same which soon after the death of our saviour be preach and receive by the king your predecessor and by the people of your realm Theodoret a greek bishop and one of the most ancient of the church in his book 9 make a goodly comparison betwixt the power of the roman empire and their law and the empire of jesus Christ and of his law receive throughout the world he say the roman can never make the persian and parthian of the east subject to their law nor towards the north the cimbrian dane nor the people of Britain but the power of jesus Christ have be great for say he our fisherman that be saint Peter and our maker of tent which be saint Paul have make the british people subject to the law of Christ the which will not obey the roman law so as antiquity do testify that the apostle have preach in our land metaphrastes cite by the cardinal Barenius say that saint Peter come thither joseph Baleus script Niceph. l. 2. c 4 of Arimathie and Simon Zelotes come likewise as history do teach we this seed of the gospel in your land take such increase as king Lucius and all his subject about the year 180. do public receive the christian religion and indeed the chronographer have note that about the year of our lord 180 Britain be the first part of the world which do public Plat. in vit. the lesph. receive the faith of Christ for Lucius king of Britain do in those day depose the priest of the gentile and do substitute in their place bishop and christian pastor he banish gentilism out of his country which happen not in any part of the world until the time of Constantine the great Tertulian and Origen who live about the same time testify that the country of Britain be inaccessible for the remains be subject unto Christ the bishop of this island be at the council of nice hold under Constantine the great three hundred year after Christ which be the first period of christianisme during the which the christian do suffer twelve most cruel persecution under the tyranny of paganism and the idolatry of old Rome we well wot that during the three first period of christianity whereof either contain three hundred year the true and only worship of one God which have be plant since the apostle time in your land have be continue there during the say time and yet the christian which live in those age no not the roman do ever allow in the public use of the service of the church of the worship of the host in the romish mass nor of the pretend wood of the very cross nor of the image of jesus Christ or his sepulchre seat near to mount Caluarie all which be worship in the new romish church as God himself which worship be abomination of the gentile arrien and nestorian which bring with it the shipwreck of eternal health the christian which live during the first period of the three hundred year of christianity do inviolable keep the first commandment thou shall have no other god against my face or before i which the Thargum of the chaldaean have interpret beside i or any other than i the greek translation say other god Athanas. cont. tom. 1. pag. 34. beside i athanasius interpret this commandment say he have not forbid they to have other god for that there be other god but least any one fall from the true God shall make he a god of that which be not like to those god which the poet and writer make mention of which have but the name of God and not the effect and the same author say if reason and the esteem we hold of God do make we believe that he may be in all place and that nothing of all that which God have under he be God and that all thing be under his power why do not they which make a creature God see that it be out of the definition attribute unto God Theodoret upon the same commandment say that the arrian offend against it and the true christian observe it they do not allow any thing to be hold or worship for God but the divine nature but those which follow the error of arrius and eunomius sin direct against the divine law for they confess the only son of God but they maintain that he be create and be divide from the divine substance God have say thou shall have no other god but i doubtless these man bring in another God by these authority we do infer that the roman which worship the host in the mass break this commandment for they agree that it be no part of the divine nature but of the substance and nature of jesus Christ humanity who be worship according to his divinity and not after his humanity according to the ancient symbol of the church the christian faith than have for a firm and only foundation the worship of one God according to this first commandment and the worship of any thing create by God which be under he ought not to be receive in the christian religion but the only divine nature of the father son and holy ghost aught to be worship and call on in triple unity without the which nothing ought to be worship without manifest impiety and idolatry the same Theodorei interpret this commandment say Serm. 2. God the maker of all thing in the begin of the law which he give unto Moses command he to worship one God I be say he the lord thy god which bring thou out of the land of Egypt and when he have put Moses in mind of his late benefit he exhort he to persist in the service of god not to divide his worship but to cleave only unto God thou shall not say he have any other god but i the which do teach we that those of the romish corruption have bring in strange god for that they have divide the adoration and veneration betwixt God and his creature make three degree the first they call Latria which they attribute to God and to the host in the mass equal the second Hyperdeulia which they yield to the bless virgin and the three Dulia attribute to their other saint and to their image and relic abuse with too gross a ignorance the signification of these greek word for Deulia signify a great service than Latria and we learn that in this place Theodoret call the service and adoration of God by the name of Deulia and so do athanasius and Chrisostome and saint Augustine who have bring in this distinction attribute both unto God only in his 84. ^ upon Exod. justin martyr who live under Antonius Pius in the second age of this period of Christianity show plain that the christian do not allow of the worship of any thing inferior to the deity and say that jesus Christ have so teach they for speak to the emperor in his apology for the christian of his time he write thus that God only be to be worship for so Christ do ^each the great commandment be thou shall worship the lord thy god and he only shall thou honour with all thy heart and all thy strength the lord God which have create thou and a little after he say we worship God only in other thing we willing serve you for that we do acknowledge you for king and prince of man and we pray unto God that he will give you wisdom equal to your royal power so as the christian in matter of religion do not yield any worship to thing create neither do they divide the worship betwixt God and his creature as the romish church do many christian of the same time be so exact observer of the only worship of God as they will not reverence the roman emperor as the soldier do in civil cause for Theophilus to Apostolicus the six bishop of Antioch who live in the year of our lord 173. when as Lucius be king of great Britain say I shall honour the emperor more in pray for he then in worship he for it be not lawful to worship any but God only the christian of these three first age have no altar no image nor any material cross of gold silver wood or stone for Clemens alexandrinus who be near the apostle time say we christian be express forbid to use in any art of deceit for so he call paint and make of image thou shall not say the prophet Moses make the likeness of any thing that be in heaven above or on the earth beneath and the same author Strom. lib. 5. Pythagoras say he forbid the wear of ring nor to engrave in they the image and figure of god as Moses have long before forbid and that we must not make any image be it grave melt counterfeit or paint that we shall not be carry away with sensible thing but shall pass unto those thing which be comprehend by understanding and soon after he say to honour the essence by the knowledge of a material thing be to contemn it the doctrine of the romish church do herein direct oppugn the doctrine of christian antiquity make a new God of the host of the new mass give it the name of God worship it as God and yet their doctor confess that it be make and create by the word of consecration it be therefore evident that they have bring into the church a God create which be not contain in the definition of God before mention by saint athanasius for the host of the mass be not every where which be the property of God only neither do it contain all thing under his power but contrariwise the counsel of Trent say in express word that jesus Christ God and man be contain under the visibie sign of bread of wine which be quite contrary to the divine nature which contain all thing in it and be not contain in any thing the god therefore of the romish mass be a God create which have a beginning and end and be contain in the visible form of bread and wine and contain not in it all thing create so as the worshipper of this god of the mass do worship a new and strange God contrary to the first commandment if the arrian as Theodoret say have break this first commandment for that they teach that jesus Christ according to his deity be a creature and yet he be God with great reason the roman transgress the same commandment confess that the pretend deity of the host of the mass be a deity purchase by the consecration and not by the eternal deity without beginning and without end and the same Theodoret write against the greek in the foresay passage teach we that by the commandment which say thou shall have no other god but i that Moses forbid to make any division of the divine worship but to give all to God only the roman who have make three degree of worship can deny but they have break this first commandment and bring in a multitude of god make as many god as they say mass so as their plurality of god become infinite and surpass the multitude of the paynim god Minutius foelix Tertulian Origen and A^nobius who live in the three age of this first period of christianisme testify that the gentile accuse the christian for that they have neither temple altar image nor visible or material sacrifice and that they do hide from sight that which they do worship Cecilius a pagan orator dispute against Octavius a Christian as Minutius do report object to the christian why have they no altar no temple no know image they do blazon our christian in the worship of the cross which they say they deserve take the cross for a punishment to who Octavius answer for the christian we neither worship nor desire cross but you who have consecrate god of wood worship cross of wood as piece of your god whereby it appear that the ancient christian in the pureness of christian religion do neither worship cross of gold silver stone or wood as these do of the romish religion how shall they I pray you worship they see they have they not and which be more will not have they but the church of Rome do quite contrary run after god of gold and silver make as the Psalmet say by man hand inregarde of that which the gentile do object unto the christian that they do hide and not show forth what they do worship octavius answer for the christian do you think that we do hide what we do worship although we have neither temple nor altar for what image shall I make of God if thou have thy right sense thou shall find that man be the true image of God and a little after he say but the God who we worship we neither show nor see if the ancient christian have be like unto the romish christian of this age the gentile can not have object that they have neither altar nor image for in truth they have more altar and image than the gentile have neither shall they have object unto the christian that they conceal what they worship for the roman show in the elevation of the host the god which they worship and cause the people to worship it the which they not only show in temple but also in the street and in general procession and other solemnity they show forth what they worship against the use of the first christian Tertulian in his book of idolatry confute with many reason the make of all sort of image to root out all matter of idolatry and after he have cite the second commandment whereby it be defend to make the likeness of any thing that be in heaven or earth he say it be forbid throughout all the world for the servant of God to use such make of image see that Enoch have forecoulde that the devil or the angel of darkness shall turn all the element into idolatry and all that it contain in heaven and earth that all these thing may be consecrate for God against God himself and so man error do worship all thing except the creator of all thing their image be idol and the consecration of image be idolatry and whatsoever idolatry commit must necessary be attribute to the maker of the idol that which Origen speak upon the epistle to the roman be to be consider to make christian whole to reject idolatry for after that he have refute the error of the gentile in that they may know God by the visible ellemente yet they have fall to the worship of the visible image of creature conclude thus to the end that in few word we may speak the truth we hold it a abominable impiety to worship any thing except the father son and holy ghost and a little after he say they wrong themselves that serve image and worship the creature leave the creator but we christian which worship and adore the father son and holy ghost only and no other creature as we do not err in the divine worship so do we not offend in our action and conversation it be most certain that the host offer up in the roman eyturgie be not consubstantial with the father son and holy ghost and much less unite in consubstantiality with the trinity as it be well note in the sermon caena insert among the work of cyprian who live in the three age where it be say that the divine essence be infuse in the visible sacrament after a unspeakable manner that there may be more devotion and reverence give to the sacrament and a more holy access to the truth of he of who body they be sacrament and to the participate of the spirit not to the consubstantiality of Christ but to this brotherly and indivisible unity for the son only be consubstantial with the father the substance of the trinity may not be divide our conjunction and that of Christ do not confound the person nor unite the substance but do only consociate the affection and bind the will if in the person of jesus Christ consist of three nature in one person worship with one only worship the divine nature have be only infuse in the humanity of jesus Christ after his birth as Nestorius do teach and not unite personal in the virgin womb cyrillus and the other orthodox do right maintain against he that to worship one Christ carry God in he have be a antropolatrie or pagan idolatry with great reason the infusion of the divinity in the sacrament and in the element of bread and wine can attribute unto it the dignity to be worship as God himself for as that text do teach we this infusion which be make in the sacrament be not consubstantial with the deity of the son of God the which be only consubstantial with the father and the holy spirit for that it do affect a most straight and mutual conjunction betwixt God and we saint John in his seventeen chapter speak of this conjunction and union where our saviour pray to his father for all those that shall believe in he that all may be one as thou o father art in i and I in thou that they may be one in we if this union shall make that sacrament of the lord supper to be worship than those which be unite in Christ and by he in God the lather shall worship one another for our saviour say in the six of saint John he that eat my flesh and drink my blood remain in i and I in he that we may know say cyprian that our abide in he be a true eat and the drink a incorporation with a duty of obedience join of will and unity of affection the eat therefore be a certain greediness in we and a desire to remain for ever in Christ we learn by these authority that even as Christ abide in we by our eat of the sacrament make we not capable of worship for that by this conjunction we be not personal unite with the deity of jesus Christ in like sort the infusion of the divine essence in the sacrament whereof saint cyprian speak make not the sacrament to be worship if it be so the say adoration be in idolatry like that of Nestorius who worship man carry God in he as be say before we may therefore say with good reason against those that worship the creature and the image of jesus Christ his sepulchre and the wood of the cross that which Origen speak against the gentile of his time God be the virtue which govern all thing and the divinity which fill all thing make themselves thereby inexcusable that whereas God have give they the grace to know he yet have they not honour he as they ought neither have they give he due thanks but have seek in the vanity of their own imagination the image of God as those of the romish church do in the mass for in their host they make figure and image they have lose in themselves the image of God they which vaunt to have the spirit of wisdom be fall into the obscure darkness of ignorance for what be there more abominable than to turn the glory of God to the corporal and corruptible image of man nature the which be do at this present throughout all the romish church as it be say so as they have convert God the creator of all thing into a corporal and corruptible form who they think to worship under those visible form we will therefore conclude our discourse of the proof of the true and only adoration of God observe throughout all the habitable world during the first period of three hundred year with the testimony of Arnobius write against the gentile object to the christian that they will not worship any but the first and the great of all the god and not the inferior god according to the manner in those day to who he answer say and we may say in that which concern the worship and honour of the divinity that it suffice we to have one only God God I say the father of all thing who have create and govern all thing in worship of he we worship all that we ought to worship when we honour he we honour in he that which he require at our hand what the duty of worship do exact that we perform by our worship for see we hold the chief of all divinity of who all divine thing depend we think it superfluous to seek to private person and a little after he say as in earthly kingdom we be not constrain to worship and honour every private man of the king house but in the honour we do unto king those which belong unto they be sceret honour with they so the christian of that perfect age do not worship nor call upon any thing under God as the Romanistes of our age do which worship the bless virgin the angel Michael and Gabriel saint John Baptist the apostle and martyr their relic sepulchre and image so as it be most apparent that the religion plant at this present in the island of great Britain be the true ancient religion and the only worship of one God incommunicable to the creature the which have continue during the first period of the three hundred year of Christianity so as it be a mere slander what the adversary of the truth say that your majesty have banish the true ancient christian religion out of your realm to plant a new religion pretend to be begin by Martin Luther John Calvin and other great personage in the purity of the true christian doctrine but contrariwise it be a immortal glory which shall increase in your reign and continue to posterity see that your majesty be the author of the restore of the true christian religion in your realm have restore it I say to that beauty and sincerity as it be in old time plant by Lucius your forerunner the first christian king of great Britain who become so affectionate and zealous of the advancement and propagation of the truth and so great a enemy to idolatry and the worship of creature and visible form that of a king he become a preacher as some history say and as during the persecution of the christian under Dioclesian and maxentius which be the most bloody of all God use your land and kingdom as a refuge for the true christian which flee from the say persecution even so the same God have make your most happy reign to be a safe harbour for the christian of our age who have be force to abandon house good and inheritance rather than to bow to the romish worship God the protector of his true church have continue his admirable grace over your land in the second period of christianisme the which begin with the most happy empire of Constantius Euseb. in Constan chlorus for during the last persecution God raise up this wise and warlike emperor in the western part of Europe in the which England Scotland and Ireland be contain where the say emperor take to wife Helen bear in your say realm who receive into his protection all the christian which flee from other province to avoid the cruel persecution which be make against they by his other associate in the empire sire we must here observe a notable policy of this wise emperor to try the fidelity of his servant and minister in the government of his empire which will much avail for the preservation of your royal estate he do publish a feign edict command all the subject of his empire to sacrifice to the false god and whosoever shall refuse so to do to depart out of his army and empire this proclamation be make a great number of christian do sacrifice unto the false god to preserve their estate dignity and good but the true christian desire rather to leave all then to serve they whereupon the emperor discover himself present and discharge all such as have worship these false god say how can they be faithful unto the in constant. emperor that be faithless unto God and as for the true christian which have leave all he call they home and make they guardiens both of his person and estate as Eusebius say I desire not your majesty shall make such counterfeit proclamation but that the same god which have make you successor to Constantius chlorus will give you the grace to make such a election of your subject as in your most important affair you admit not any but such as be know to be well ground in the true christian religion for even as a modest woman ought not only to be chaste but free from all suspicion even so those which be employ in the affair of true christian prince as your majesty be shall be free from all suspicion of false religion the say Constantius die at York in England after that he have institute Constantine the great his son the which be a other especial grace which God have pour upon your realm and even as under king Lucius it be the first part of the world which do banish the pagan idolatry even so God have raise out of the same island the say Constantine the great who expel the same romish idolatry out of all the other province of the habitable world whereof your majesty have a familiar example to imitate in this restorer of the christian religion this great Constantine your predecessor and countryman in the begin of his empire he study what god he shall choose as the same Eusebius say that his father have condemn the error of idolatry and all his life have worship one only God the protector and of the empire the free giver of all good upon this resolution he make choice of the true God to serve believe that the only cause of king and emperor felicity proceed from he alone as the same author say he worship the same god that be above all thing and in his ordinary prayer be alone he speak to God alone whereby it appear that the religion which your majesty have establish in your realm be conformable to that of your predecessor Constantine who worship as I have say but one only God the creator of all thing and not the cross and image of jesus Christ in his ordinary prayer he do not call upon the bless virgin saint Peter saint Paul nor the other apostle and martyr neither have we read that he do consecrate his empire to saint Andrew or saint George as some of your predecessor in the time of error and blindness but do dedicate Euseb. ibid. his house and family to one king that be God only God be his only patron who recompense he with all good thing and make he lord and conqueror over all other prince he command all his army to call upon one God as the giver of victory he appoint that in their prayer they shall lift up their hand to heaven and the eye of their understanding to the most high king of heaven he also teach they the form of pray to God as follow we confess thou to be the only God we acknowledge thou to be the only king we call upon thou to aid we they do not invoke the virgin Marie by thou we obtain victory over our enemy we give thou thanks for the benefit we receive in this present life hope for future thing by thy mean we cry unto thou with all humility that it will please thou to make our emperor Constantine victorious and preserve his godly child in long life and happy health they do not call upon the angel Michael and Gabriel to give they victory hereby we see that it be a false and slanderous thing which the adversary of the truth impute to your majesty to have leave the ancient profession of your predecessor and to have plant a new religion begin by Martin Luther John Calvin and other most learned man who God have stir up in our age to abolish the false romish worship as have be sufficient prove to your majesty in the discource of the first period of the first three hundred year and to show that the only worship of the creator without mingle the adoration of the creature continue unto this ' second period of three hundred year in your island I will content myself with the say of sedulius Scotus Hibernensis who live in the five age in these word which he have draw out of Origen which I have before cite it be a sin of impiety to worship any other but the father sedulius in cap. 1. epist rom. son and holy ghost whereunto saint Augustine speak very fit say know that the christian whereof there be a church in your town worship not any dead thing neither aug. epist. 45. tom. 2. any thing that have be make by God but God only be worship who have make and create all thing our adversary dare not affirm that the host in the mass be one of the three parson of the trinity as we have say which be a great heresy then that of arrius who say that the son of God be a creature have a beginning be not the son of God from all eternity all their doctor teach that it be make and create by the pronountiation of the word of jesus Christ take his beginning by the consecration whereby we infer that they be worshipper of visible form and therefore idolater in worship it see it be no eternal creature nor consubstantial with God the father for athanasius Theodoret cyrillus and all the ancient father booth Greek and latin of the second period of three hundred year of Christianity teach that if the son of God have be create or have have any beginning that he have not be worship for that the creature do not worship the creature God only Athan cont. arr. 3 epist. Ephes. be to be worship if the son have be a creature he have not be worship God forbid we shall worship the creature this madness fit best with the pagan and arrian and in another place he say that the christian worship not the body of jesus Christ divide from the deity neither when we worship the word say he do we separate the word from the flesh but know that the word have be make flesh acknowledge that which be in the flesh to be God and a little after speak of the leper he say he worship the lord in his body and do acknowledge he for God and the same Athanasins teach we that the body of our lord be not consubstantial with the father and therefore not to be worship alone with great reason the host which can be say consubstantial with the father be not to be worship for if the deity of jesus Christ have not be consubstantial with the father and without beginning as the father be it have not be lawful to worship he and this sire have be represent unto you in the first period the which I repeat here to show the continuance of the worship of one only God it be therefore manifest that the christian of this second period end in the six hundred year of Christianity do believe that it be a pagan idolatry to worship any creature which have a beginning restrain all adoration but to the trinity alone worship nothing underneath it the which be comprehend by Gregory orat. 3. pro. pace Nazianzen in few word where he say that we must worship nothing above or beneath the trinity for say he it be impossible to worship any thing above God and to worship any thing underneath God be mere impiety let we add hereunto what Theodoret say who live in the five age touch the adoration of the sacrament of the lord supper for that the roman corrupt his writing attribute unto he the worship of the symbol of the body and blood of our lord jesus Christ which he never dream of for beside that which we have before allege that he condemn the arrian for that they worship the deity which they say be create he say in the fifty five question upon genesis that God do allow to eat the flesh of beast to restrain the people from worship of they foresee that man shall fall into that blindness and superstition as they shall worship beast as we read of the worship of the golden calf like unto the egyptian where Theodoret conclude that it be a mere madness to worship that which we eat so as according unto Theodoret the priest shall be mad to worship that which they eat athanasius against the arrian teach that the deity be not to be eat and yet the roman maintain that their host be God himself and they sin that they eat that which be present in the host which in effect be to make the deity edible our saviour before he leave this world will leave unto all man that shall believe in he a perpetual commemoration of his true incarnation and passion to the end this memorial shall be as it be a symbol of the presence of his human nature here on earth he may as well after the manner of the greek and roman have leave his portrait lively draw to serve for a representation and commemoration unto such as shall believe in he yea they shall make infinite number of picture like unto the star of heaven to be in all assembly of christian and to show that he have put on a body like unto those picture but he who know the spirit of man common incline to idolatry will not leave his representation in the figure of a man to take from he all subject of idolatry but he choose rather to institute the symbol in the element of bread and wine wherewith his human nature be nourish as we be now the which be nourish daily when there be no reason to worship they see we do eat they as Theodoret say and yet the spirit of darkness have in the old time induce man to eat the beast and then to worship their image have since expositor in rom. find mean to pull from the church the firm bread in the communion bring in a kind of wafer which can proper be call bread casand in be so thin on the which be print the image of jesus Christ the which they have Honor. in since worship whereas it be institute only to be eat in remembrance that jesus Christ have a human body nourish like unto we to continue betwixt he and we the communication of this incarnation by the element wherewith we be all nourish this only adoration of one God have continue the six first age after our saviour Gregory the first bishop of Rome bring in the invocation of dead man in the begin of the seven age with many other superstition yet do he never teach that we must worship the image of jesus Christ as Christ himself as Thomas Aquinas and other romish doctor do teach we neither do he teach that we shall worship the consecrate host as God but contrariwise write to serenus bishop of Marseilles he command he in express word that he restrain the people from the worship of image and that the people shall prostrate themselves with all humility in the worship of the only almighty and holy trinity so as the romish doctrine of the last age be direct contrary to that of the first six age after our saviour and yet this pope command they to hold image in their church yet not to worship they but to serve as a commemoration unto the people of the history of the bible only but to what end serve this it be as much as if they shall forbid one to be drink who be natural incline thereunto and yet command he to lodge in a tavern and to consort himself with drunkard or like to he that shall command a young man in the heat of his youth give to licentiousness to abstain from it and yet to lodge in a brothel house man nature be as much or more incline to idolatry then to drunkenness or luxury and therefore the divine providence know this imperfection in man will take from he all subject of idolatry Theodoret Serm. 7. cur Grec affect say that the wicked spirit to deceive ignorant man invent the art of paint grave and other workman to forge image and picture to serve for matter of idolatry and that they have not only fill the temple with image but also the market place street and public place yea even rich man house the which we see practise at this day in the temple market street and house of our adversary Arnobius in the six book against the gentile say that they take the same pretext for the use of image in their church to serve the ignorant and unruly people who they make to worship they give they venerable form to the end say he they shall believe there be some virtue in their brightness which do not only dazzle their eye but strike a terror in their heart by the brightness of their resplendent light we be to observe the special grace which God continue his work have show to the land of great Britain in the begin of this seven age for Gregory the first have send Augustine the young into the same island to plant many superstition with the invocation of saint neither he nor his doctrine be receive but the misery be that soon after the death of Gregory the worship of image do so increase as it be the cause of many trouble betwixt the west and the east as we shall show hereafter in the seven eight and nine age make the three period of christianisme the Hebrew Greek and latin tongue be almost root out in the western part of Europe through the inundation of barbarian which do tear in piece the roman empire with the true divinity whereby we observe that even as the true religion begin with the say empire and so increase even so the empire decay the sincerity of christian religion be almost abolish and decline so by their division in the west that Satan work the mystery of iniquity in the heart of the eastern bishop make they to have no respect to the purity of antiquity bring in a new worship of the creature of the cross and of the image of jesus Christ the apostle and martyr a idolatry mere pagan we read in the act of the second council of nice print both in greek and latin in Paris that the say council do decree that we must esteem the image of jesus Christ as jesus Christ himself and that as the person of jesus Christ be distinguish from that of the father in and unite in substance even so his image shall differ from he in substance and be unite in person the which be a intolerable blasphemy and as great as the heresy of arrius and Nestorius for that be to make a god of a material thing o^ make by hand and to worship it as God as the gentile do worship the workmanship of man at that same time God raise up in the ilane of great Britain that venerable beda who teach the Hebrew Caidee Greek and latin tongue divinity and philosophy out of who school come johannes Scotus and who plant learning and the science in the city of Paris and be afterward spread over all Europe this johannes Scotus be schoolmaster to the emperor Charlemain who with stand the idolatry of the eastern church cause the second counsel of nice to be declare heretical and abusive by that of ado. in Chro. frandfort as we read in ado the same emperor become so learned as he write a book against the pagan worship of image the which be find among the learned out of the same school come one after another Ma^rus a Scotishman as many writer do testify Cla^dius taurinensis and Bertr^^ a priest with other light of the church in the three period of Christianity which be the seven eight and nine age which have fight against idolatry and the gross error of the sacrament as we shall hereafter show the four period of christianisme which contain the ten eleven and twelve age be so destitute of man adorn with true piety and learning as the seed of the idolatry of former age come to the accomplishment of the abomination of dissolution at which time archdeacon of anger with his disciple and Peter de Valdo with the school begin by he about the same period resist the romish idolatry plant in all the west we will likewise observe a especial grace which God pour upon your land and realm during these age of ignorance and idolatry for even as the great man of the former period disciple to the english beda who maintain the only worship of God go out of the island even so God during this four period preserve the same realm and defend they against the tyranny of Rome for Peter of Clugny write to Bernard say that the Scotishmen in his time do celebrate their easter after the greek manner which be a testimony they be not yet subject to the church of Rome which hold they heretic that follow the ceremony of the greek who in the time of the say Bernard have their liturgy and service of the church as they have at this day which be a communion like unto that of the reform church of these time neither do the greek church ever allow of that heathenish worship of the sacrament of the lord supper as in the romish church which cause Marcus ephesius who be orator for the greek at the counsel of Florence in a sermon print at Paris in greek and latin at the end of the volume of liturgy to confute the mass of the latin as direct contrary to the institution of jesus Christ so as the scottishman who maintain the ceremony of the greek church have not yet receive the new romish mass nor the heathen adoration of the host whereby we see that the people of your realm be the first that make public profession of Christ and abolish gentilism during the cruel persecution of romish emperor and when as the tyranny of the bishop of Rome bring into the church about 400. year since the worship of the host as God the creator the same british peopl be also the last of the west part of Europe which receive the abominable worship of thing create instead of the creator this heathenish worship begin under pope 3. about the year 1225. who command all priest and curate to teach the people to kneel at the elevation of the host in the mass or when it shall be carry to sick person yet this idolatry be not long after receive in the church of Germany and France for Ralph de Rivo print a book at Rome can. obser. propos. 22. witness that Nicholas 3. about the year 1277. take the old missalle out of all church of Rome bring in a new form of mass invent by the friar minor or franciscan at this day say he all the book at Rome be new after the manner of saint Francis and meaning to describe the form of mass observe in those day in Germany France and other nation he say leave the manner of the friar minor let we follow the holy canon the ancient scripture and the general custom of place and in doubtful thing the most ancient book and in the twenty three proposition he describe particular all the ceremony of the mass as it be use in his time who live in the begin of the age of christianisme at what time it be find that the conjunction of the bread and wine be observe according to the institution of our saviour and that both the priest and people do eat and drink together stand without adoration or invocation of the sacrament and in the end of the say proposition he say it be sacrilege to use bread only dept in wine in the sacrament of the communion so as there be no difference betwixt the communion of the reform church and the communion of the mass in those day except the sign of the cross and some other ceremony vestment and incense the mass therefore of our age be a new fiction of Cordiliers or franciscan friar and the worship of a pretend God and the privation of the cup be a plain sacrilege for if they abuse to use bread steep in wine instead of follow the full institution of our saviour be as they say rodolphus de Rivo write condemn as sacrilege with great reason be it a more horrible sacrilege to have quite take away the use of the wine from the people the romish church of our age can be call the true church see they have no communion of the cup and be fall from the true priesthood as the arrian and nestorian by their error los^ the outward mark of priesthood during the five period of the age of christianisme which contain the thirteen fourteen and fifteen age the western church be divide into two part for in the time of Bernard Peter de Valdo a rich bourgesse of lion have be instruct in the only worship of God by the read of the holy scripture have the romish idolatry in such horror as he sell all his good and cause the bible and many writing of the ancient father to be translate into french he make assembly at lion and appoint penfion for religious learned man to set up school of divinity who be since persecute by the pope and their adherent the say school be disperse over all France and a good part of Spain Germany and Bohemia who have ever since maintain the same article of the faith which be profess at this day in the church of your realm whereof some be call Albige^is and other Taborites which have flourish and reign unto this day notwithstanding all the persecution fire flame and cruel torment use against they by the supporter and favourer of Rome out of this school also come John Hus and jerosme of prage Wickliff a Englishman Paul Cra^ a scottish man who maintain the true and only worship of one only God and other article of the faith confess by the reform church of Europe the which be see by the article recite by Aeneas Silvius be since Aeneas Silvius in hist. boem pope which show a notable correspondency betwixt the first period of christianisme and the five for even as in the first three hundred year the true christian who worship one only God without mingle the adoration of creature have be persecute by pagan Rome even so the worshipper of this true adoration have be cruel persecute during the three hundred year of the five period by room disguise with a christian mask there be a other admirable correspondency betwixt these and the second period for even as in the end of the first period the god of army do raise up that great Constantine to plant his church by force throughout all the roman empire be then pagan abolish idolatry in the worship of man of image and of visible and material form even so after the end of th^ five period God suffer the restore of the (@) true ancient and christian religion to be do by arm we read in the bohemian history of the say Aeneas Silvius that Zisca a great captain assemble in the year 1501. a mighty army beat down all idol and image abolish the new mass or the worship of the host soon after many prince do rise and many faithful learned man by who ministry and valour the pureness of the preach of the gospel be restore in the sincerity of christian truth as it be at the come of Constantine in the west of Europe I may therefore just say that
