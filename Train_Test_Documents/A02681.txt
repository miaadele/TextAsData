Francis shall never be prevent with a unhappy death 2. whosoever shall take the scapular of the carmelite and die in the same shall never be damn 3. whosoever shall fast the first Saturday after they have hear of the death of Luissa a spanish nun of the order of s. Clare shall have no part in the second death the first of these lewd position be take out of the chronicle of the friar minor for so be the franciscan call tom. 1. and father upon s. Francis as one of those legacy bequeath by he unto his order and by the friar of his order indifferent to be communicate to so many as shall before their death desire to be put into their habit which that it may be the better know and notify unto the world it be common print under the image of s. Francis and place at our altar as both myself and many other have behold with our eye in this city the second be record in a certain sheet of paper not much unlike unto a ballad print by the friar carmelit the title whereof be a abridgement of the privilege of the holy scapular grant by the most gracious queen of heaven MARY unto the order of the carmelite in which compendium or brief the institute of the holy scapular for so be it call be lay down in these word s. Simon Stoc the six general of all the latin of this order do receive not without a manifest sign of the divine favour this most sacred scapular for when as he have along time with much earnestness beseech of almighty God that by some manifest token it may appear that the friar carmelite be in the undoubted protection of the bless virgin behold upon a certain night he see the mother of God in great glory who reach down unto he this divine scapular with these word Most love son receive this scapular of thy order a token of my confraternity to thou and to all carmelite a privilege in which who so die shall not suffer ever last fire behold the sign of s^lvation safety in danger a league of peace and a everlasting covenant etc. if more can be ascribe unto he who die for mankind upon the altar of the cross I leave it to holy church to determine and such be the vision of s. Simon Stoc exhibit by the carmelite unto the estate in the castle of Dublin in the month of August 1633. by the hand of Edmund doyle priest and if any doubt hereof they shall find the very original with i when ever they shall be please to demand the same and such be the authentication of the scapular of the carmelite evangelize everywhere by the friar of that order and represent unto the eye at many of their altar by table of picture now if any desire to know what thing this scapular be and have not see the same behold this description the scapular be only two square piece of cloth of the bigness of two trencher the form of a scapular the one before pendent upon the breast the other behind upon the shoulder from whence it have the name of scapular the three proposition as touch the saturday fast of donna Luissa the nun of s. Clare be much insist upon and most careful teach by the cordelier or franciscan friar and particular by friar Thomas babe who publish the same the 29. of April be the feast of s. Peter martyr and s. Catherine of Sienna in the year of our lord 1631. in the cook-street of Dublin in a public audience who exhortation to the people be to this purpose that forsomuch as a certain holy virgin call Luissa of the order of s. Clare have a revelation that whosoever shall fast upon the next Saturday after they hear of her death shall never die in mortal sin or of any evil death the aforesaid friar Thomas babe persuade the people then present to undertake so holy a penance move wherewithal very many and I say signanter very many as they do be loeve his doctrine so do they most careful observe the same fast among who as chief of all the rest Thomas Fleming alias barnwell archbishop of Dublin for exaniple unto his flock and as a prime man of the same order observe most devout the same as himself have not be ashamed diverse time to acknowledge neither be that doctrine only then but sundry other time also teach by that false apostle Friar babe and his fellow in diverse other place of this city and diocese most holy father I meddle not with the matter of indolgence neither do I intend or ever do to discourse of that argument I only complain of these wicked doctrine and I do adjure your sanctity in the name of the crucify that you confirm your flock in these part that they be not lead away with these new doctrine from that faith in which our holy mother the church have breed we from her breast I say that we be no long mislead by these mendicant who seek to persuade we these carnal fancy more serviceable I confess unto the belly than any way behooveful unto the soul but rather as the apostle will we that we abide in those thing which we have learn and have be commit unto we in no sort admit these new apostle as send from heaven but rather avoid they as seducer come from hell for we fool do very believe that he who be bear of the bless and immaculate virgin God and man jesus and Emmanuel who suffer so many and so grievous torment upon the cross under Pontius Pilate who arise glorious from the death and ascend into heaven that he and no other redeem we from the curse of the law that he and no other have cleanse we from our iniquity and wrought our reconciliation for we and that neither Paul nor Apollo nor the habit of s. Francis nor the scapular of the carmelite nor dame Luissa the nun of s. Clare order be she never so holy a woman have wash we with her blood or be crucify for we most holy father you have give unto we for the pastor of our soul a friar of the order of s. Francis by name Thomas Fleming alias barnwell consecrate archbishop of Dublin to he our diocesan be present our complain and grievance in the behalf of the clergy of Dublin against the most horrid and blasphemous tenant beforementioned I say two r. priest in the name of the rest personal appear before our archbishop do present he not only with the name of the delinquent but a catalogue also of their witness and proof which pass on the 7. of march in the year 1631. in this city of Dublin but what answer receive the two priest from their ordinary true none at all neither to this day have they profit in that suit for very it be to be fear that this disease who nature be to fret like a canker have invade and infect the head no less than the rest of the body and we be the rather enduce to believe the same for that we see these error and corrupt doctrine day lie more and more to prevail and to enlarge themselves especial among the ignorant and common people alas too easy and flexible to be lead astray for there be a number of regulars especial of the franciscan and carmelite false apostle who not only in pulpit preach these ertor but as the apostle say go from house to house subvert whole family teach what they ought not for filthy Lucre sake for no small profit doubtless do arise unto these poet and inventour of fable insomuch as they may true say with Demetrius the silver-smyth act. 19 sir you know that our gain be of this occupation for say i who in the world be there that believe any thing to remain after death and ash who will not be glad to avoy the the pain of hell who desire not to enjoy a bless eternity in heaven and I call heaven and earth to witness what thing be there more easiethen before death to creep into a friar habit or what more tolerable then to fast one day which be no more than have one competent repast at noon to for bear a supper at night or what be there less troublesome than to carry two square pannicle or clout the one upon his back the other at his bosom under his garment I wis a carriage not so burdensome nor comparable so painful as be that heavy become of the cross which sweet in carry upon his back to mount Calvary and on which the salvation of the world do hang. doubtless if future glory in the world to come and the assurance thereof in this life may with so small a labour be purchase who be so much a Euclio or strait hand who so much a Lucian or a atheist as will not willing admit these bless friar bring such abundance of spiritual richesse with they into his treasury into his garnell among his herd and flock yea into his whole substance and mean not a sad or a unwilling but a most joyful giver or what woman careful of her soul health will make spare of whatsoever be in her custody or under her hand she bracelet her ring chain jewel her chest of linen her arke of meal and malt in exchange of such immortal benefit and to have so propitious and present god albeit our saviour have say what exchange shall a man give for his sell the same truth have also say narrow be the gate and strait be the way that lead unto life and few there be that find it and our saviour foresee that there will come in the last time of the world such as will endeavour to enlarge that way and to make that gate more wide he present add take you heed of false prophet that come to you in the clothing of sleep but inward be raven wolf by their fruit you shall know they and what be the fruit sweet jesus of these prophet among we at this day but to make the gate of heaven to gape as wide as the gate of hell itself for albeit the apostle have exclude from celestial glory not a few say etc. for understanding know this that no fornicator nor unclean or covetousiperson which be the service of idol have inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God yet will our friar admin they all if they once fast dame luissaes saturday fast and albeit Christ our lord exclude the man who have not a wedding garment from his kingdom yet will the franciscan friar let in any who be clothe with his habit and so the carmelite such as be find with his scapular about their shoulder I say all these so qualifve shall be accept of and be admit as well unto the dinner of the great king as unto the supper of the lamb who then can marvel these doctrine suppose as orthodox yea as oracle that we day lie see so many to be bury in friar weed so many man and woman day lie to take the scapular witness the register of the friar franciscan and carmelices in which their name be careful record as perpetual benefactor unto their order nay who be there especial among the laity who dare so nurch trust to the suffering of our saviour and to the merit of his death and passion as they dare be find in the hour of death without that thrice holy scapular that sign of salvarion that safety in danger that league of peace and of aneverlasting covenant in which who so die shall never suffer eternal fire all which attribution be incorporate unto the say scapular by the bless virgin if Simon Stoc his revelation be authentic yea many among we nor trust to the habit alone or unto the scapular alone or to the nun fast alone will before their death be furnish with they all three together have wise understand that of Solomon Proverh 4. a triple cord be not easy break in which their proceed i seem that yet they show some weakness of faith for if they do constant believe every one of these three promise salvation to be assure by divine revelation as their teacher be be they in hand sure either any of they be sufficient or all of they together insufficient neither do it boot the friar to cloak these their error by say that these doctrine right understand do not import every sinner by keep such a fast^ by take such a habit or scapular to be favy but such only as be contrite with all for their fin and be wash in the blood of the redeemer for neither do our friar in their Semons and exhortation mention any such condition etc if they do yet notwithstanding the who doctrine of the Sabbaoth fast the habit and the scapular no lesseblaze by the friar then superstitous believe of the people will utter vanish into smoke for why a person so dispose and qualify that be penitent for his fime and rely upon the redemption of in CHRIST be apt for the kingdom of God and to receive a inheritance among the saint and elect say he be naked of habit and scapular and not at all acquaint with donna Luissa her saturday fast yea a man end his day in the service of God and as the divine say in the estate of grace can not miss of his salvation have he but a couple of hawkes-bell about his neck or if he die in his old boot as well as in scapular or habit if then the friar thus expound himself he that die in the habit or scapular shall undoubred be save always provide that he bein the love and favour of God very he may as well have spare so much breath to have cool his broth I say as to spend it upon such a gloss as corrupt and quite over-throweth the text no no in there be poison in the pot for these preacher desire no thing less than to be so understand in their sermon when they make their panegyric of the habit and scapular unto the people for by that mean they may be in danger not only to loose their offering at the altar but that great authority and place which they have in the heart and affection of the laity no rather with all possible endeavour they labour to be believe that by the virtue of these rag either as cause instrumental or infallible sign salvation be to be acquire and hence it be that the carmelite friar dedicate yearly a day of great festivity namely the 16. of july unto the honour and reception of the scapular as the franciscan also do to that parcel of their habit which be the cord or girdle ar which festival time it be lamentable to behold how much the divine majesty by these beggar and their devotoe be profane in his creature yea true the world may less admire in these dismal day the sun to be eclipse and the rock to rent then at the time of our saviour passion behold the benefit thereof so miserable deface by these false teacher who in these day can be content to rob the people of their purse but of their soul also and to the end they and all those that read these my write may understand that I will not inveigh without just cause or reprove in word what I be not able by good argument to confound I serious demand of our friar what ground they have either from the divine oracle ecclesiastical tradition or monument of the father to promise this security and certitude of salvation or to determine of the son of Adam in particular and by poll that their name be write in the book of life I say while yet we be pilgrim from our lord and not arrive at our country I hear Solomon one of the secretary of the holy ghost say who can say my heart be clean I hear job say etc. Job 9 albeit I be innocent yet shall my soul be ignorant thereof I hear the apostle say work your salvation with fear and tremble I hear s. August upon the 40. psal say I know that the justice of my god remain but whether my justice do remain or not I be ignorant for the apostle do terrify i say he who think he stand let he look to it he fall not so s. Hierome in his 3. book upon the prophet jeremy man see in the face God in the heart and that which unto we do some time seem clean in God eye be find filthy add hereunto the testimony of s. Ambrose in his 5. sermon upon the 118. psal s. chrysost Homil. 87. upon John s. Gregory lib. 6. epist 22. s. bede in his Comment. upon the 20. cap. of the prov. but I may not ommit to set down at large what s. Bernard that pillar of God church in these late centurye have leave write of this argument as in many other place so especial in his 1. sermon in these word who can say I be one of the elect I be one of those that be predestinate unto life I be one of the child of God who I say can say this when as the scripture cry out against he man know not whether he be worthy of love or hatred certain therefore we can have but yet we be comfor with the trust of hope that we may not by anxiety of this dubitation be torment above measure so he last to this cloud of testimony out of the ancient father I will add the uniform consent of the modern father of the council of Trent condemn and anathematise this certitude of salvation can. 15. in these word if any shall say a man regenerate and justify to be bind by faith to believe himself undoubted to be in the number of the predestinate let he be accurse and in the can. follow if any shall say that by absolute and infallible assurance he have that great gift of perseverance unto the end unless he have learn the same by special revelation accurse be he so the council and sure no marvel since this presumption of salvation be the very food and fuel of all wickedness and impiety the provocation and incitement to all shameless lust and pleasure with which the soul once possess what further care be to be take in matter of conscience for say that now I have either get the habit of the franciscan upon my back or the scapular of the carmelite hang about my neck a most present antidote against hell and damnation what have I henceforth to do with the commandment of God and holy c^^rch why shall I fear for the time to come to loose the reins unto my unbridled passion or to set sail which way the stream of my misplace desire do carry i headlong I say what cause have I further to wage war with vice or long to resist the sweet allurement of evil yea what shall hinder i to say with Solomon have run the same course with he eccles 2. all thing which my eye have desire I deny they not neither do I forbid my heart to enjoy all manner of pleasure these be the thought these the labour of the mind these the discourse of the understanding which do often burst out into the lip and tongue of man entangle in these intricacye of error and what Moses have we among we to put himself as a wall and a bulwark for the house of Israel who shall pacify these congregation of Abiram who shall consume and burn up this new fire of the son of Aaron with a better flame where be Elias or where be Micheas to reprove these false prophet of please but perilous lie where be that apostle of Christ who shall confound these false apostle with a apostolical zeal scarce be there one Peter to be find among we to oppose himself to these simons scarce one Paul to deliver up these Hymeneus and Alexander unto Satan that they may learn not to blaspheme for tell i who be there among the clergy at least in this our northern island divide from the rest of the world that be either willing or able to go against these regulars move so irregular out of their own proper sphere nay rather who be there among we not carry headlong by these their raptand violent motion into the aforesaid error if not in express term of approbation at least by a shut up cye and a seal lip of a silent connivance one circumvent by fraud another detain by fear of displeasure the three win by benefit the most or all of we draw to a far more penicious dissimulation than be that of barnabas condemn by the apostle for albeit the priest of the clergy in these part be less refractory unto ecclesiastical discipline yea true far more obedient unto the law and behest of holy church than the regulars yet not much more learned I confess and in number far inferior unto they as may be see in this principal city of Ireland in which there be only six pastor but of regulars not much sewer than a hundred albeit by reason of their ebb and flow their frequent excursion cause by their manifold negotiation in every corner of the kingdom their out-gate beyond the sea and back again return it be as hard to what number they be of as to count how many frog there be in the second plague of Egypt yea to such a potency they be grow and that in a short space in this kingdom of Ireland that what cause soever they take in hand be it just or injust ecclesiastical or temporal they will nay they must be conqueror so unite among themselves so back with powerful friendship so animate with foreign correspondencye not to speak of ordinary consanguinitye and affinitye foster-ship and gossip-fhips so entail not only to the commons but unto the great family by take in of youth into their convent May into their cloister furnish merchant with custom purchaser with money upon mortgage and rend charge absolure rule in all matter of contract and matrimonial cause manage the assay of rich widow but seldom I confess help they to husband * * for so they may be debar from estate legacy and executorship at the pillow of every rich man especial when he be about to make his will serve in that business both for ghostly father council and clerk by reason of which employment and what else may either be honourable or profitable unto they they be ascend unto that height of authority that if they shall tell we the crow be white and the swan black though we can not believe they yet shall we not dare to gainsay they or to contest with they for as it be the nature of plenty to beget prosperity and this pride so our regulars at this day be arrive at such a unmeasurable greatness through plenty and popular estimation as they be not only a terror unto the inferior pastor of God church but even unto bishop and cardinal nor will I except thou o pope Vrbanus who not once as we be credible inform from the city have complain of their insupportable pride and insolence say to such as complain of their injury I marvel not that they wrong you for they wrong myself and as these regulars be awful unto the clergy so no less fearful be they unto the laity who therefore yield they such attribution as either they hope their friendship to be a advantage unto they in the prosecution of their end or they provident foresee how much the malice of a powerful enemy may be prejudicial unto they in the same kind so as be who thou will friend or foe the friar will benefit himself by thou if thou be his friend and well-willer he gain by ^hy love if his adversary than also for fear of displeasure and offence like unto those lawyer who cassiodorus upon the 73. psal say with layer their very silence be vendible and their ongue be harmful unless they be tie with silver chain but true as in the natural body when any one part or member grow into a exorbitant bignesfe beyond due symmetry and proportion the rest of the member become sick and feeble and the whole body (...) in the ec^l^sihft^call or politic Sody may instant with the safety thereof to permit so great a party and so intrinsical a faction as be our regulars in Ireland to swell to such a bulk as exceed the bond of due proportion they draw unto their self the humour of the fest of the body to the destruction of the whole neither in write these thing most holy father be my meaning other than be the soup of that thrice renown archbishop of armagh and primate of all Ireland common call by writer by the inhabitant of this country s. Richard of dundalke in his oration at avinion make before pope innocentius Sci his cardinal in these word most holy father in the begin of my speech I do protest that I do not intend to aver or rash affirm any thing which may be contrary unto the christian faith or catholieke doctrine and that my meaning be not to press or persuade the destruction of the mendicant order approve by holy church and confirm by the see apostolic but rather to persuade that they may be reduce and bring ^acke again unto the purity of then first institution always mind to submit myself unto the censure of your holiness so and so imindefull of my duty and obforvance unto the thayre of sl^^^^ be bold to speak ^nnco my lord of such affay es we may conc^^^^ the w^ll^^are of soul and the good of this church of Ireland in which I now have almost live for the space of these ^^^my year and the rather I hold myself bind so to (@) fo^^^at ^^mnot ignorant but know right we blow your how live among so many protector of R (@) (@) dear so muny general so many patron (@) (@) etc agent for they scarce shall you hear a word of sincere truth without many gloss and commentary of most corrupt addition yea and for one verity a mass of forge and devise fable especial from these remote region and as you call they in Rome Tramontane province yea such be the misery and calamity of prince and great personage as well ecclesiastical as politic that seldom by the care do they conceive that birth which with all their heart they desire not to be vital and long-lived that be seldom hear what they will not hear such multitude there be of parasite and flatterer who suggest unto their sense nothing but what be rare glorious and above measure grateful who for to please they hold it but little inferior to immortality nevertheless such have be my breed and education from my infancy which together with my year have grow up with i and be now confirm in more than a decline age that I rather desire to live poor with the philosopher and feed on colewort in this my tub then to act the flatterer with Aristippus and surfeit on pleasure in the court of Alexander and forsomuch as now for many year we have have your Ho. amost vigilant pastor and a lover of truth I hold it not so much to concern myself as the whole church of Ireland to intimate these no small or trivial matter unto you for as it be our part to open if not the imperfection and small excess of our brethren which charity will rather have conceal then reveal yet certes so soul so into be rabble so manifest adulteration of our holy faith we can not we ought not woe dare not smother which happy if we shall the very stone will cry and roar they out in your ear so doubtless to you holy father it belong to apply wholesome remedy to these disease to pour wine and oil into these wound to assuage the tempest of these rage sea to chastise with your pastoral staff these butt ram which lead the follow flock astray unto hurtful and uncouth pasture orif they contemn to hear your voice to cut they off from the rest of the fold by the ecclesiastical sword of your censure that the good be not infect by the fellowship of the bad the sound by the disease these thing be expect by the church of Ireland from so great a pastor by he to be govern to be cherish to be defend to be enlarge and so the prince of pastor to his vicar and to his flock on earth be ever propitious who power over he and his write be willing acknowledge by Paul HARRIS a familiar disputation with the friar propound by the author cap. i. and thus gentle friar have as you see make my moan to pope Vrbanus 8 of your false and seditious doctrine the pillar of your pride and ambition and no small revenue unto your garnell cellar and kinchins give i leave to and dispute the aforesaid case of the Habis Scaputar and fast a little more familiar with yourselves as my equal the end and butt I shoot at if God so bless my endeavour be to undeceive such poor soul among we as hitherto have be inveigle and besot with these your dream and pleasant fantasy since it be my part no less to confute orror then to teach true doctrine and to discover such false apostle as seek to transtorme themselves into the apostle of Christ and albeit some happy will hold it a labour needless to oppose these senseless tenant which like unto ill plastred wall threaten their owner nine not long subsist yet other and peradventure with more reason will also judge my endeavour bootless and to no purpose for that in most man opinion these doctrine be so fasten or rather as I may say so rivet and wedge into the head and heart of the people as it may rather become the labour of the apostie than any other Paul to dissolve and to remove the same according to that of divine Petrarch lib. 1. error deep root be not easy pull up forsomuch then as these supernatural prerogative ascribe unto the hubit seapular and donna Luissa her fast be all of they build upon vision and revelation and we be teach by the holy ghost from the mouth of the apostle 2. cor. 11. that Satan can transfigure himself into a angel of light and therefore be admonish by the same apostle not to be circumvent by he who operation consist in all power and lie sign and wonder and in all sedmong of iniquity I demand then of you o regulars and especial of you grey friar and carmelite how you come to know that forsomuch as s. Fraugis and s. Simon Stec may as well as many other saint have be delude and abuse by Satan in this kind that not withstand these revelation of they be heavenly and divine and for such to be take and believe and not rather illusion of that enemy of mankind and will art who have a thousand name and mean of deceive for say that s. Francis and s. Simon Stec be canonize saint yet not all that be write by they or of they be canonize truth and therefore as wicked man and woman in the scripture have be honour with divine vision and revelation as Balaam Pharaoh Saul nebuch aduczar pelat wife and the sibyl so have many of God servant be deceive by strong illusion to believe lie example whereof we have store as well in the dialogue of s. Gregory write above a thousand year ago as in that more ancient legend of the holy man and Eremites of Palestina Egypt and The^ais write by Palladius within the first four hundred year after Christ to omit infinite other in history of late time nay s. Francis himself seem not to have be privilege in this kind I say from be abuse with false revelation for as we read in the chronicle of the friar minor he have under he a vicar general who name be Helias it be reveal unto he by almighty God that the aforesaid friar shall both die out of the order and be damn in respect whereof the holy Faaher s. Francis do ever after so dis affect the aforesaid friar that he can not endure to behold he yet not many linesafter in the very same sap it be report how the same s. Francis have a revelation from heaven that the aforesaid friar Helias shall do penance for his sin and not be damn at all this shall you read in the chronicle of the friar minor tom. 1. cap. 118. and such as will take pain to peruse s. brigids revelation and conserre they with our legend of saint life shall find innumerable example of like kind one saint have a revelation direct contrary to what have be reveal unto another notwithstanding that there be but one God one truth and we may be enduce or rather enforce to believe that these revelation vision and apparition of s. Francis and Simon Stoc if any such be be mere satanical illusion and no divine revelation for that they promise that certitude and assurance of salvation in this life which be repugnant to sacred writ the uniform consent of the primitive father the uniform consent of general counsel and the belief both of our holy mother the church and all her obedient child even unto these time as I have abundant prove in my epistle to pope Vrbanns and not necessary here to be repeat again and therefore I will conclude this first point with that of the apostle Golat. 1 that if a angel from heaven shall come and preach unto we contrary to what we have receive anathema sir but yet to give scope to a more full and ample discourse of this argument let we admit for the present that s. Francis and Simon Stoc have receive by divine revelation that whosoever shall die in the habit of the one and the scapular of the other shall undoubted be save for it may not be deny but such certitude may be have by divine revelation example we have of the scripture of the two glorious apostle s. Peter and s. Paul of s. Mary Magdalen and some other for the arm of our lord be not shorten nor his power abridge yet say I conformable to the doctrine of holy church as afterward shall be prove that this can be no assurance or security unto other who be not partaker of the say vision and revelation to believe that doctrine because what be of divine authority unto one be but of human and sallible authority unto another for say that Peter know a thing to come by certain and divine revelation yet the same shall be to Patrick but only a human relation receive from the lip of Peter a mortal man subject to error and mistake to deceive and to be deceive and be but in and none in termine peccable in thought word and deed and therefore we see the church who wisdom be from the holy ghost never to canonize any person though repute never so holy while they be in the flesh and till such time as their sanctity be attest by sign and wonder from heaven as then s. Francis before his conversion be of life and conversation like unto other of his rank and quality and not much scrupulous of the offence of God till he come unto the age of twenty five as may appear both by the first word of his testament as also by his life write by bonaveniure so albeit I confess the a d and better part of his life after his conversion and dedicate himself unto the service of God be as a thread more even ipun than the former yet not altogether without some knote as may be know by his own confession when on a time so journ in the palace of the cardinal cruse and in the nighttime be beat of the devil he repair in the morning to the presence of the aforesaid cardinal to who he relate what he have endure and then add man that know i not repute i as a saint but behold how the devil who know i well do handle and chastise i for my sin so he Chron fras minor ay cap. 13. out of all which I do infer that a vision or reuclation be not therefore authentical or to be believe because such a person who after ^is death be canonize for a saint do in his life-time avouch the same either by word or write because it be necessary for my p^ucent assent unto such vision or revelation that the same be canonize for supernatural and infallible truth which can be but by authority of holy church which have canonize for certain and infallible verity no other man work say or write than those of the prophet and apostle as that angelical doctor s. Thomas have in these word 1 2 q. 1.8 2d 2 our faith be ground upon revelation make unto the apostle and prophet who write the canonical book not to revelation if any such be make to other doctor for which doctrine he city also s. aug. in his epistle unto s. Hierom epist 14. in these word only to the book of scripture which be call canonical I have learned to give that honour that I most firm believe that none of the author thereof have err in writing but other writer I so read that with how great sanctity or learn so ever they do excel I do not therefore believe a thing to be true because they have so judge or so write so s. aug. now future glory in heaven be a supernatural object can by human knowledge or moral certitude be assure unto we but either not all or by divine faith which though not clear and evident yet excel in certitude and infallibility all scientifical knowledge whatsoever and this I say to answer those who happy in defence of their error in the aforesaid revelation will say that albeit indeed they be not to be believe by a divine and a supernatural faith yet may they be certain unto we that be from some other topical argument which in truth be as much as if they say nothing preach a infallibility of the aforesaid vision and revelation then bring unto cheir justification they answer we with nothing but historical legend and I pray God not rather fabulous and mere human possibilitye when the poor soul in the mean time trust unto habit and scapulat as oracle of truth and rock of a sure foundation at the evening and perclose of life find itself irreparable deceive and in a moment for misbelief siuke down to hell whence neither the habit of s. Francis nor the scapular of the carmelite nor the Saturday fast of dame Luissa shall be able to fetch it our and because that Dives can not obtain of Abraham that one shall come from the dead and signify unto his brethren what entertainment these habit and scapular wearer find in the next world our friar do the less regard what Moses and the prophet what the apostle father and general counsel teach for not be convict of their error by experimental knowledge of the dead they less reck on of any other proof demonstration or argument which not withstand we will not spare further to urge against they or whatsoever else may confer to the demolition of this so desp^rat a error possess the last act of man life and make the same most tragical for as it be true say a man shall never offend the second time in war and why because by c^^ath the second error be prevent so with much more reason yea with ruth and compassion may it be say of a christian die in mi^ belief of a matter of such consequence as concern his eternal woe or welfare he can twice offend a error conclude in death 1^ singular be solitary and unaccompany no reparation by repentance to be hope for the door of life be also the door of mercy which once shut be never more to be open marvel not good reader that I labour in confront so horrid a doctrine for if by all my endeavour I draw but one soul by the ear out of this sink and pit of error it shall well become my profession and the disciple of he who seek the stray sheep and find it bring it home into the fold upon his shoulder or at least I shall avoude that censure of s. Bernard say the ass fall into the ditch and there be one ready to pull he out the soul fall and there be none to put to his help hand the absurdity then of this doctrine of the habit and scapular besides what hitherto have be say may in this also appear that if they perform what they promise and what their revelation do import that be certitude and assurance in this life of glory and salvation in the next they surpass in esticacy all the sacrament of the church what soever have be or dayn by divine authority and practise by christian since the primitive time until the second come of Christ for the sacrament of the new testament by our saviour institution do only confer grace and predent justification have all their virtue and e^ticacy from the merit of his passion only as instrumental cause confer on such partaker of they as through their indisposition either of misbellefe or complacency in sin do put no impediment or bar unto their spiritual and supernatural operation they who desire to see the proof of this doctrine from scripture from counsel the greek and latin father and the schoolman I remit they among many other unto the second tome of tho-waldensis or William Lindanus his Panopli^ or the. Stapleton his or cardinal Bellarmine lib. 2. cap. 3.5 etc. now then say I albeit this be very much that our saviour have do for we in the institution of the sacramonts yet far more have s. Francis and Sirnon Stoc do for we by the habit and scapular because he who this day be cleanse from his sin and justify by the virtue and divine operation of the sacrament may after again fall into the like or more grievous sin and for the fame be damn as of the contrary he who at this time abuse the sacrament by reason of the indisposition above mention may afterward be penitent for the same and by the comfort and help of they attain his salvation as may clear appear by the apostle doctrine and admonition unto the corinthian as touch the use and abuse of the eucharist 1. cor. 11. now I say that by our friar doctrine the habit and the scapular be far more effectual unto salvation than any one of the 7. sacrament or all of they put together can be for whether the habit and the scapular work in the nature of the sacrament by coufer the first or second grace they do over and beside confer the grace of perseverance and the perfection of all grace which be glory and this neither the baptised nor the conform nor the housel nor the order nor the penitent nor the marry nor the anoint can promise unto themselves by which it be manifest that in these man doctrine the Babis and the scapular infinite excel all the virtue of the sacrament and so according to be hold and esterm as indeed in many man eye and opinion at this day they be but now happy these patron of the habit and scapular press or rather oppress with the weight of these argument and be ashamed to ascribe the divine work^ of the sacrament unto shadow of no great authority or antiquity than the vision of s. Francis and s. Simon Sto^ will happy tell we by way of a qualification of these their absurd assertion that the habit and the scapular do indeed resemble the sacrament but how only so far forth as they be sign of future beatitude in the next world without have any virtue or efficacy of effect what they do signify for whereas the 7. sacrament of the catholic church be indeed sign yet not base and naked but withal operative that be as secondary and instrumental cause work that grace which they signify and signify that grace which they work the habit and the scapular will these man say be sign of another kind only foreshow and signify beforehand that happiness and glory which shall befall all such as shall be find in the hour of death invest with they albeit they no way concur to the production of the aforesaid glory either by supernatural physical or moral influx and of this kind of sign we have example in the scripture not a few such be the rain bow Genes 9 place by almighty God in the cloud after the flood for a sign unto Noah and all mankind that he will never more destroy the world by water albeit the rainbow be no cause of any such effect at all such be the fleece of gideon both wet and dry judg. 6. a sign unto he from God that the and amalekite shall be conquer by his hand such be the sun 4. reg. 20. go back ten degree in the dial of king Ez^chias a sign give unto he by the prophet Elias that he shall recover of his infirmity and to omit many other sign like unto these of which the scripture be plentiful such be that sign of victor that appear unto constantin the great be to encounter with maxentius the tyrant when in the sky he see a most bright cross with this circumscription (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) in this overcome euseb lib. 1. albeit not that sign of the cross which appear unto constantin but he in who hand all victory be second by human mean be the cause of gain that battle and so indeed it be say of the divine scapular in that sayned revelation of behold the sign of salvation safety in danger a league of peace and of a everlasting covenant say then that we admit of this qualification of they and take it for grant that the habit and scapular be but bare sign only significative and not operative and only of the nature of those four sign last mention yet must we needs confess they to be sign of far more excellency and of a great importment in respect of their supernatural object which be glory I mean then either the rainbow in the cloud or gideo^s fleece upon the sloore or the retrograde sun in Ezechias horologe or constantin his cross with the emblem thereof in ^oc Vince in this overcome for that these be but sign and pledge of temporal blessing as security from inundation victory in war bodily health and the like but s. Francis legacy bequeath unto his friar be that whosoever die in their habit shall not perish of any unhappy death Simon St^^ of the scapular be that whosoever die therein he shall never suffer eternal fire dame Luissa her Saturday fast be that who so perform it shall not end his day in mortal sin these I wis be sign not of any worldly benefit or temporal blessing but of that crown of immortality which attend all such as have be victorious in this our christian warfare for if the soul that better part of man be of a divine be and immortal as the best philosopher have teach and if it be of that precious esteem with God as he be say in the scripture to be a lover of soul and our bless saviour the redeemer of soul can say mar. 8. etc. what shall it boot a man to ga^ne the whole world and to loose his own soul and if king Ezechias be so tender of his corporal health as he desire that the same shall be confirm unto he by a sign from heaven which be a pledge far more lief and dear unto he than be that of fig apply unto his sore a secon^lary cause of his health no marvel then though a poor sinner shall prize a sign from heaven a assure pledge of eternal salvation before all other treasure upon earth yea before all other help and mean conduce thereunto alas then if it be true that these man tell we why be not s. Francis and Simon Stoe no soon with we why do poor sinner miss these so precious sign and pledge of their salvation for a thousand and two year since Christ or why since there have be habit and scapular from the day of s. Basil and s. Augustine and s. Benedict that none of they have that divine influence or signification as the gray habit of the minor and the two square patch of the car^^clites the former not five hundred year old and the late not so much but not to lament the time of great antiquity alas and well away where be this bless habit and scapular the day wherein s. Bernard die in which it be report that of 30 thousand person who then depart this life only s. Bernard and two more be save for so s. vincentius the dominican inform we in his 6. sermon Septuag from a vision make unto a holy ermite sometime Deane of Langres in France as also martinus Polonus in his promptuary of example cap. 18. or after that time again and within the date of these so mystical weeder where be these help and divine comfort so far transcend all sacrament and sacramental when as in the year of grace 1343. a holy ermite see in a vision the soul of man and woman fall as fast into hell as ever snow come down from the cloud and only three to mount up to heaven namely the soul of a bishop and of a charterhouse monk and of a roman widow this shall you read lib. ^rt^ in the time of innocentius the six of that name sure it seem that either in those day there want preacher to publish these miraculous grace of the habit and scapular or people to believe they or else we must say that the shop want frise and woollen cloth to make they of or tailor to cut they out which for my part I will as soon believe as the wood of Arden in Germany to want thief and freebooter or the garden of Egypt to want leek and onion which some of the egyptian worship as their god as may appear by that verse of Invenal sat. 15. hor to chaw a onion or a leek be hold a foul offence o holy people who god do grow but wot you whence their garden and I pray God that many among we who will be esteem very good and perfect christian yield not more honour unto the creature albeit they make they not their god than they ought or may stand with the integrity of our holy faith but to return to our argument for I purpose to leave no reason or indiscuss which may serve to discover the vanity of these aforesaid revelation with which so many soul both have be and be at this day abuse and first for that legacy of s. Francis ground upon a vision or revelation that whosoever die in his habit shall never be prevent with a unhappy death I persuade myself beside what already have be say that it be a mere fiction and a lmposture of his friar of late time untrue father upon the saint for the maintenance of their belly and first it be hold as most probable that s. Francis have no certain or particular habit at all either of this or that cloth or colour but only course and of small price such as may best sort with poverty and penance as may appear by his rule cap. 2. in these word let all the friar be clad with course clothing and they may patch they with sackcloth and other patch on God blessing and this which our friar do hold to be a precept of the rule or equipollent to a precept may seem to be confirm by the practice of the order for see we not the capuchin to wear a distinct habit from the cordelier agree in nothing but only in colour the Capuchin have a large frise coat to the foot with a piece of course canvas square one half yard upon the back gird unto he with a rude massy rope with a great knot before and unto this coat sow a steepled hood or ca from whence they have the name of capuchin of well-near two foot long from the basis to the and over this coat they have a cloak of the same frise come little below the waste when as the cordelier profess the same order of s. Francis and the same rule have a coat of much better frise without that square canvas on the back with a hood or a capuch not steeple at all but round and fit unto his head a girdle of a cord from whence he have his name of cordily the same handsome wrought with many artificial knot orderly place by equal distance a sleeve o heavenly wide which beside the arm will well contain a couple of cheese quarter or a gammon of bacon apiece or as many pudding as will well near serve a whole convent of friar for their breakfast and over all this they have a cloak of the same frise descend almost unto the foot observe then how different these habit be and yet those franciscan again which be of the reformation of s. Diego they have a distinct habit both from the Capuchin and Cordelier sith then each of these deny the other to have the habit of s. Francis I then demand of our friar which of these habit or be it all of they that have the blessing that whosoever die in they shall never be prevent with a unhappy death but what be the true habit of s. Francis or which of the reformation have get it I make account they will agree upon it when my finger grow all of one length and then happy myself will be as credulous as other to believe they now again it be to be observe that this revelation of the habit be not to be find in the life of s. Francis at all notwithstanding his life be write by many and most of they of his own family and order as first and soon after his death by s. Bonaventure neither be it in the bull of his canonisation of pope greg. 9 nor yet in the roman breviary or any other legend of late time either of Lippolo or Lippomannus or Villiegas or last of all by friar Luke Wadding a cordily live this day in Rome in all which legend of the aforesaid author matter of far less consequence I wis be not forget and yet not word of this great benefit of the habit to be read in they beside be it not a thing to be admire and wonder at that s. Francis leave such a golden legacy unto the world that whosoever die in the habit of his order shall be save that himself be not careful to die in the same as well for example unto posterity as also to be partaker of that security of salvation with other christian for we read in the first tome of the chronicle of the priar minor cap. 71. that s. Francis when he perceive the hour of his death approach strip himself all naked and then cast himself upon the ground make a exhortation to his brethren to persist constant in the love of God and the profession of holy poverty till such time as the guardian who he obey understand the desire of the holy father take present a habit with the cord and linnea breech bring they unto he say father take this habit which I lend you with the cord and breech that you may be bury there with to cover your nakedness and it be there say that s. Francis content take the breech but not the habit for that he desire to conform himself unto our saviour who die naked upon the cross last how can this aforesaid revelation of the habit stand with any truth or probability when as daily experience condemn ^eth the same of crrour and falsehood and therefore more like to be some belly-invention of his disciple apostate from the rule and discipline of their founder than any wise authorix by s. Francis who doubtless be a holy man and who in his life-time do see and do both condemn and lament with great grief of mind the manifold disorder of his follower and the prevarication of his rule as may appear by sundry passage of the history of the friar minor whosoever will take the pain to peruse the same I say then that set aside all other reason sense itself and experience do sufficient confute and convince of most into lienable falsehood that doctrine of our friar minor namely that whosoever die vest with their habit shall never be prevent of a unhappy death for first if it be understand of temporal duaster and calamity in death these frail body of we have so many window to admit they according to that of the tragedian every one may deprive we of life but none can debar we of death which have a thousand gate among which calamity attend our end if sudden death be reckon for one as it seem by the doctrine of holy church to be we be teach to pray from sudden and inexpected death deliver we good lord what shall we say of that subtle doctor among the francisean johaune Duns Scotus who be Apoplecticus or subject to the palsy and suppose in one of his fit to be dead be bury alive as appear at the return of his absent companion who be acquaint with the nature of his disease cause his body to be take up which be find all break and bruise with strive to recover himself from his sepulchre who fate be report by Paulus I vi^^ in these word take with a apoplexy have his punishment so as bury for dead too hasty when as nature too late have digest the force of his disease and life return in vain desire help and yield a miserable roar and often beat the store of his grave at length his head be violent bruise he perish so jovius who fate want not also a poet to express the same in verse as follow quans viator at janus vitalis what chance before to none I be force to bemoan o thou that pass by lo Scotus where i lie who twice though be dead be once but bury of i some doubt not say and sure I think they may each sophist I outgo in captious argument this and much more as touch the fate of Scotus may you read in in his continuation of Cesur Baronius his annal in the year 1494. but not to wade into any further sea of example Spain will tell you how many friar minot have be cast away by sh^pwrack in their voyage unto the indies myself in the year 1610 in the territorye of Lerma in cantle with many othor the whole town in a manner go forth to the same behold the murder body of a franciscan friar a stranger to that place who be suppose to have have money and be rob of they be also slay and his body hide among the stand corn near unto the gate of the town of Le^ma but some peradventure will say that sudden death be not to be number among unhappy or disastrous fate at all for so much as we read that julius Caesar dispute of that argument the day before he be slay in the senate-house be of opinion that a inexpected death be to be prefer before any other Sueton in julio and a princely writer of these time in his exposition upon the lord prayer seem not to disallow of that death which yield least trouble unto the sense so as in these man opinion not a sudden but a unprovided death be that which be to be mislike conformable to that of the just man though he be prevent by death he shall be in a refresh and by their leaf I will say that the death which be inexpected may well be suspect and fear to be unprovided and therefore for my part I pray God that death may knock at my door along time before he enter still lean unto the old intanye from a sudden and a unlooked for death good lord deliver we but to leave this point to those who have more leisure to dispute it whether a sudden death be to be number among miserable death or no let we come unto a second wherein I demand whether a death ins^icted by the hand of justice may not just be number among unhappy death and I think none will deny it forsomuch as Peter have say let none of you suffer as a or a thief etc. if then we find friar of the order of s. Francis who for their crime and demerit have be sentence at the bar of tribunal to in famous and dishonourable death how then have their habit privilege they or where be that legacy of s. Francis that who so die in the habit of his order shall never be prevent with a unhappy death if any be so curious as to inform himself in this affair I shall not need to send he either unto the italian Guittiardin or to spanish and french history or further then unto the annal of England and for no large a time then betwixt the norman conqueror and king Henry 8. where he shall find example more than a good many of that kind I say of friar of the order of s. Francis who have be put to shameful death by the hand of justice and the same neither for building of church nor minister of sacrament but some will say that still I come short of the mark and of what be intend so long as I insist only in these temporal calamity that accompany the death of the body which with how terrible a countenance soever they look upon their patient by any misery or casualty deprive together with their life of the benefit of the sacrament yet we know not but eu^n in their last agony or before continue unto their end through the abundant mercy of God they may be find penitent and true contrite for their fin and so as in that despicable and wretched a passage unto the eye of the world they may be able to say we have pass through fire and water and thou have bring we into a refresh so as still to make good that prophetical prediction father upon s. Francis by his friar such as die in their habit whether by death sudden or deserve they shall always die happy since no death be to be hold absolute miserable except that one which carry with it of which the apostle s. 1. ^oh 5. there be a sin unto death I say that for it no man ask which sin by s. Augustine judgement be final impenitency I affirm say he that a sin to day his to leave faith work by charity even till death decorrept and cap. 12. and the same doctrine he teach civicate Deilib. 21. cap. 24. so then the last refuge of our friar be that set apart ^ll other kind of death of which none can be define to be absolute miserable such as die in their habit shall never die impenitent but true contrite for their sin by which they sh^ll be secure from the second death and the eternal separation from the bless vision of God so s. Francis his suppose revelation of the habit and Simon Stoc of the scapular do concur in this in which whosoever die shall never suffer eternal fire as than we have hitherto prove and instance by many exaples that notwithstanding the habit of s. Francis there have not want such as have perish both by sudden and infamous death so now in the last place it remain to take away all tergiversation to manifest unto the world which some will say be a hard tax that diverse friar end their day in the habit of s. Francis have be subject even unto this last and worst kind of death join with final impenitency and obdurateness in sin and consequent according unto the doctrine of holy church can no way be hold to have die happy and albeit no man in this life may judge another man servant for that as the apostle say he stan^s or fall unto his own lord to who all judgement both of quick and dead be reserve and that ordinary none come back from the next world to tell we how they fare according to that of job. 16. loe our year pass swift and I walk the path by which I shall not return notwithstanding in our writer of the act and monument of saint we find nothing more common or familiar than vision or apparition make unto the live as touch the and condition of the desunct somerev eal to be in glory some in purgatory other damn as whosoever will peruse that large vo umt of s. brigids revelation or Casarius or or capgravin or the chronicle of s. Francis or any of our late legendary collector will witness with i but set all these aside which for my own part as I do not whole reject deprive they of all credit and authority so neither be my faith so strong as to admit into my creed very much of what I read of that kind consider that if the belly have in all time be a great master of art according to that of the poet Venture the belly be a master of art and a supplyer of invention so above all other in the school of our monk and mendicant have the same be not only a master of art but even doctor cathedration a doctor of the chair pablish both by voice and writing whatsoever may be serviceable unto the genius of the place omit then all vision revelation and apparition I hear our saviour say that there be there be a sin against the holy ghost which shall never be forgive I hear the voice of the same truth say John 3 such as believe not be judge already I hear the belove disciple say 1. John 5. there be a sin unto death for which I say that none do pray I hear s. aug. say Deilib. 21. cap. 24. if there be any that persist till death in impenitency of heart do the church now pray for they that be for the soul of they that be depart I hear also 34. forbid to pray for such as die in desperation or misbelief or kill themselves tell i then you who pretend to be and the most strict imitator of s. Francis what shall we say of such of your order as have be mnrder in delicte you know my meaning of so many as have be execute for judaism by sentence of the inquisition especial in Spain and Portugal of which sort in Lisboa there be a friar Minor in the year 1610. who be burn in his habit upon a stage and die obstinate in his infidelity till the last breath cry loud and often in a lamentable and die voice o God o my God from the light do I wake unto thou what say you to other of your order who prevent the course of nature have murder themselves have you forget or can you ever forget that woeful spectacle which happen in the person of @ @ excuse i that in my arcte I call he George barnwell Thomas Barnwel a franciscan friar who upon s. John day in Christmas in the year 1630 hang himself in the orchard of temple Og scarce two mile distant from the city of Dublin upon the bough of a appletree not only in the habit of his order but use for that execrable service the cord of his habit with which he gird his loin what voice be there then so wicked or pen so profane as to publish these man and the like to have dve happy no rather may they say what have the habit or the scapular prosit we or wherein have they help we for save that in our life-time they be beneficial unto cur belly the confidence that we have in they after death have deprive both our body of christian burial and our soul of the prayer and suffrage of the church and of all faithful people now then to conclude this chap. with be capirulation of such argunent as have be allege in the precedent discourse against the doctrine of certainty of salvation by habit scapular and the luissian fast first then gentle reader thou have see the same refute from authority of the church scripture counsel and father second thou have behold the absurdity and falsity thereof lay open before thou by very sense and experience in all such kind sort and variety of death as by christian in all time have be hold miserable unhappy and ignominious of all which friar in their habit have be sensible and sufferer and therefore that doctrine of they must needs remain void of all truth that whosoever die in their habit shall never be prevent with a unhappy death and yet these be our apostle and missionaryes send from Rome to convert nation and to reduce they to the Catholic faith such apostle and preacher as doubtless shall never turn any unless it be fool into mad man true friar missionaryes if these be the sign of your apostleship and this the gospel you preach soon shall you catch a hare with a tabor then convert a Protestant into a roman catholic if among the savage indies you preach these doctrine I know not what credulity you may purchase but if in these part you seek to gain soul and to bring such as be astray into the right way doubt less it must be by other doctrine than habit and scapular britanni we Britan live not in so gross anayre though much unto the north but that we can discern of colour who preach Christ and who themselves and if the former have be till this day as well apply as the latter happy that that rock of offence at which so many have stumble have be before this time remove you mendicant enter here among we with specious and glorious title of legantine and missionary power you tell we you be send to labour in the vineyard to work in the harvest but what say the Protestant when he see all you labour be but to eat the grape and to cull out the best sheaf when they find all your preach turn into beg or at least there unto tend marry say they these be those who preach themselves and not Christ jesus and say they not true you tell we you be send from Rome to assist the priest and the pastor ingovern and feed of their flock but very in all part of this kingdom it be well understand what slocke you look after o how well it become the francisean and the dominican after they have shame the poor people on a Sunday morning out of their mean the week after to gadd through the parish and to gather in their mutton and hear they together Coridon and Thirsis in and after to expose they to sale one with another at 12. penny the head in every barony of this kingdom gentleman expect when the friar sheep pass by or where they keep the market hope what they get so easy they will not rate too high and as dextrous as they be in bring home the stray sheep so no less diligent be they in seek the lose groat it be a laudable custom of the church command by express canon that all christian shall communicate at least once a year and the same at easter at the hand of their own pastor and this be call the Paschall communion at which time as by the precept of holy church all that be come to the year of discretion do participate the bless body and blood of our saviour in the holy eucharist so common do every one according to their devotion and ability make their offering which offer the good people in this country common lie down upon the altar and it be indeed the chief maintenance that the pastor have for all the year after but think you this poor groat can escape the friar gripe no for now the holy week approach the friar limitour beftir himself and the week common before and after easter he visit all the parish of his limit and he either address himself unto the oratory of the parish priest or else himself make a rande^^us in some principal part of the parish where he say mass hear confession receive all he can procure to make the Paschal communion with he have all the year before prepare and persuade the people that by reason of their indult and privilege from Rome they shall as well satisfy the precept of the church in communicate with he as at the hand of the i'astor neither dare the parish priest contest with he for the friar be not unprovided of his friend who will make good all his pretension so as if the priest give but the least opposition he shall not only not prevail but he shall have the frown of the best of his parish happy all the year after and thus the groat lose by the priest be find by the friar and where be it all this while but upon the altar close by the candlestick this be that good assistance and this the help which the parish priest at Easter get by the friar industry who have find the groat return home and there rejoyee with his fellow who in other parish have do the like service put the surplus of their get into the hand of their syndieu or treasurer of which every convent have one and I pray God such treasure be reserve for good purpose cap. 2 the author apology and a defence of his write but now I wot well what our mendicant with all their faction both in private and public speech will thunder out against i be it well do for a Catholic man to discover the fault of church man a priest of his brethren be it not better that these enormity be cover with Constantius his purple robe be dal and a byword unto so many atheist and misbelieve sectarye as these time do yield ^o do not the prophet David when he hear of the overthrow of Saul and lonathar and their slaughter upon the mountain of Gilbon cry out with great lamentation in Gath Ascalon (@) filin Philistin n^ exulten^ili^ o pisblish it not in Gath nor preach it in the street of Ascalon leave peradventure the daughter of the philistine doerejoyce and the daughter of the incircumcised triumph to all which and what else they can say against these my proceed I answer with s. better it be that scandal shall arise than that truth shall be forsake and be it possible say I to refixe error and not to name it to reprove vice and not to tell what colour it be of have I do otherwise in these my proceed than the prophet of God who oppose themselves unto such prophet as for a piece of bread will prophesy please thing in the care of the people or then the apostle of our saviour who both by word and writing do confound the false apostle who enter in among they to corrupt the truth and to adulterate the gospel of the kingdom and have not this be the practice of the pastor of God church in all time do not s. athanasius s. Hilary and s. aug. most bitter inveigh against the arian heretic s. Hierom against lovintan and Vigilantius s. beruard against Abaylardus nay not against false teacher only but against vicious and corrupt liver also have the aforesaid father latch out into the depth of most sharp reprehension not spare the vice either of church or layman of their day and why shall I in a like cause be fearful to imitate so great example to rebuke such false prophet as sacrifice not unto the creator and his providence but unto their own fishing-net line and hook the fancy and invention of their own brain to oppose such as call themselves apostle and be not but be find liar and why shall I more fear the face and frown of a friar then s. Antony of Padna a principal preacher among the friar Minor or s. bondventure some time general of their order than s. Francis himselso in stitutor of the same order of who the first have these word ^ etc. alas how great division how great schism how great dissension be there in religion and true where these be there be nothing but contention in the chapterhouse dissoluteness in the choir murmuration in the oloyster and the dormitary so Antony de Milan in his sermon upon Sunday s. Bonaventure wonachi in etc. when as according to the father the monk be praise to have dwell in cott and poor habitation what be the matter now that you build high and stately house sumptuous monasterye you purchase large and spacious court when as be poor and beggar you ought to be contemner of all worldly thing so s. Bonaventure q. 6. s. Francis be so far out of love with his own friar as see they in his own day no less a bound in wickedness then in number he leave off to be thein general minister give they over as his word be to the devil to be their tormentor both in this world and in the other for the prevatication of that rule he institute and the transgression of the vow of their profession all which and much more to the same purpose shall you read in the 1. Tom of the chronicle of the friar minor the last chap. what shall 1 say of johannes Lanspergius the Carthusian monk who in a certain sermon which he preach unto the congregation of friar relate the miserable condition of regulars he utrer such thing as be hardly to be beloeve that a Catholic man will publish I will report his word as they lie and they be these religion be perish regular honour be perish and many be not far from account a monk searce among christian man so Lanspergius and not many line after it be not to be speak without grief and with the licence of you and all good man so great have be and be at this day the coldness of the most in religious order so great their dissoluteness so great their discord so great their faction and to be short such self love and so little mortification of their evil passion that it have obscure the very name of all good man for if you look into their life set aside certain exterior sign and badge of religion in their habit nothing may you find or hear in they wherein they go beyond worlding what marvayle then be it if lord have give we up to a hiss to a mock a wonderment and laughingstock to all nation I say what marvel be it if we be account inforiour both in name and estimation to man of the world since what monk be there who go beyond they either in devotion piety or moral honesty so Lanspergius with much more to that purpose in the place above allege Laurentius justinianus sometime a canon regular afterward Patrick of Venise Obedientiacap 19 saint mute^ oenobia^ and there be many convent and I will to God not the great part that be not to be call the habitation of saint but the denn of thief the haunt of devil and the shop of vice s. Brigid not the virgin of Ireland but the widow of Swedland lib. 4. revel cap. much lament the deformation of religion in her time it be a heaviness to behold the rule of religious to be change into detestable abuse and not to be observe as s. aug. dominick and Francis have by the inspiration of the holy ghost stay they down the same s. Brigid condemn the avarice of regulars bring in our saviour detest the same in these word and composucrunt in porridge mann^ and a^ pecuni^m i^o they have receive ten commandment from i and they have reduce they all into one word and what be that one word forsooth stretch forth thy hand and give money yea they be never satisfy with what they get so s. Brigid and Thomas Walsingham a monk of s. Benet order and of the abbey of s. Albon set forth the condition of the friar mendicant in his time a most pious and a learned author have these word the beg friar unmindful of their profession have forget to what end their order be institute because their lawgiver and founder most holy man will therefore have they poor and altogether free from the possession of temporal thing that they may have no impediment to hinder they from speak the truth or any thing they may sear to loose for the same but now while they envy such as have possession approve the fault of greatment nourish the common people in error and eat the sin of they both in seek of possession who have ^^nounced possession in hoard up of money who have swear to persevere in poverty they call good evil and evil good seduce prince with flattery the people with lie and draw both of they with themselves astray they have in such fort stain that their profession of truth by their unhappy life that in these day in every one mouth it be a good argument hold as well in form as matter this fellow be a friar and therefore a Lyar. even as true as that this thing be white and therefore have a colour but that we may not be think to have write these thing of malice let all of we acknowledge ourselves to be in fault and let we amond what willing we have do amiss and beseech the god of peace and love most devout that peace and truth may be in our day so that holy monk Thomas Walfingham in the reign of Richard 2. fol 226. he live in the day of Henry 6. and die in the year 1440. Atmathanus that glory of the irish church both for sanctity and learning archbishop of armagh and primate of all Ireland common know by the name of s. Richard of dundalk speak of the great disorder of the beg friar of his time especial of the franciscan have these word by which may be understand how soon and even in those primitive and better time of their observance they deflect from the vow rule of their founder when as the rule of s. Francis say command after this manner etc. I do firm command all friar that they have not any suspect fellowship or counsel with woman neither that they once enter into the monasterye of nun except those to who especial licence be grant from the see apostolic neither that they be gossip of man or woman lest by such occasion among the friar or of the friar scandal may arise but of the contrary say my author the friar have get licence to hear the most secret counsel of woman of lady and of other without yea with their head very submissive bow unto the woman head not follow the footstep of holy job who say I make a covenant with my eye that I shall not think of a Virgin so as now-a day through such familiarity they can play the philosophce with most beautiful dame in their chamber by occasion whereof such seandall through the world be rise of the friar as I will not declare the same so in his about the midst with much more to the same purpose he decease in the papal court of Avignion with opinion of great sanctity in the year 1360. cal. Doce^b but I must not omit what the say author set down in that his oration which he pronounce before pope innocentius 6. and his cardinal against the friar at Avignion as touch the abuse of their privilege make they a instrument of covetousness in these word the parishioner may reasonable judge that as concern due and profitable penance to be enjoin he for his sin the pastor or parish priest be a judge less to be suspect and more indifferent than the friar for that the penitent can suspect nor have any ground to imagine that his pastor by hear his confession do expect any temporal lucre or profit unto himself for so much as all thing necessary for his maintenance according to the law of God and holy church be annex unto his office but as for the friar it be not so because as in that appellation which they make against i in England it be contain according unto their foundation as they avouch that not withstand they be privilege to hear the confession of all such as will confess unto they they be bind to most strict poverty and beg whereupon the parishioner may probable suspect that very the hope of gain and of the relieve of his poverty be the cause why the friar hear his confession and thus he may reason with himself in his mind wherefore shall that beggar that sit there hear my confession and so defist from seek thing necessary for his maintenance unless he expect from i such a supply and forsomuch as poverty be a motive to sin by mean where of his want may be supply according to that of Solomon prov. 30. poverty and riches give i not but only so much as shall be necessary for my maintenance lest happy be full I may be emise to deny thou and to say who be the lord and force by poverty shall steal and forswe be the name of my God it follow that forevery kind of sin the friar will impose upon i almsdeed by which his poverty may be relieve and so shall not I be spiritual cure for our saviour when as his disciple ask he why can not we cast he out I speak of the devil he answer this kind of devil be not throw out but by prayer and fast math. 17. whereupon it be infer that as to every corporal disease a particular medicine be to be apply which kind of medicine that beggar attend only his necessity as I may well think will never minister unto i and this reason be thus confirm for that it sufficient appear that since the friar have obtain a privilege of hear confession everywhere through the world they have build beautiful Monasteryc^ and princely palace the cause whereof seem to be their grant of hear confession for that before such power give unto they they be not able to build such house again it be never hear that though friar either for building of bridge or repair of highway or parish church do enjoin alm upon their penitent neither do the friar minor impose alm to be bestow upon the dominican nor the dominican upon the minor every one apply all unto themselves and unto their own order wherefore it may be probable judge that private and gain be the cause why such a beg friar be so careful to hear the confession of the layman that he neglect his time of beg etc. so cardinal Bellarmine for learning and piety in this age not infetiour to many and I know not whether to any lament the miserable face of religious order of these time in a most devout treatise which he compose but a little before his death call columba lib 2. cap. 6. have these word regulars have begin to be multiply without number and many of they not call by God unto the estate of perfection but enduce by other motive have replenish monasterye and that of Isaiah be fulfil thou have multiply the nation but not increase their joy hence so many so grievous scandal know unto all which yield plentiful matter unto the dove of bewail the looseness I will not say the corruption of religious order themselves as they be at this day so the cardinal Ichannes Petrus camus bishop of bellay that great omament of the french church both for piety and learning in his book call the ^^^ltua^ director part 4. cap. 7. in show the difference betwixt pastor and mercenary plain demonstrate ou^ of the word of our saviour that the regulars who in these time will be esteem the only master in Israel advance themselves above the ordinary pastor of God church assume unto themselves the first part as in perfection of life so in rule and feed that flock which our saviour have purchase with his own blood be in truth no pastor at all but plain mercenary and hireling and for such only to be hold and repute his word be these which proceed from so grave a author be worthy both to be read and ponder pastor as well bishop as curate be by state oblige to expose their life for the sheep commit unto their charge let we concern this point give care unto the divine sentence which can be deny without impiety nor contradict without blasphemy there be no great charity then to give his life for his friend let we now add here unto the description of the true and good pastor deliver unto we in the 10. chap of the gospel of s. John from the lip of our saviour himself the good pastor or shepherd give his life for his sheep which be as much as to say be oblige to give it out they and pastor but the hireling and he that be not the shepherd behold how our saviour distinguish the mercenary or hireling from the pastor and how he make it apparent that the mercenary be not the pastor and that he who be pastor be not mercenary he add the hireling and who be not the shepherd and the owner of the sheep in which word the mercenary or hireling be plain describe to be the party to who the sheep appertain not so as he who have no sheep of his own and serve notwithstanding the sheep be no pastor at all but only a servant a mercenary fellow and a mere hireling without any flock of his own let we follow the Text. etc. he that be the mercenary see the wolf come and fly and the wolf devour and disperse the sheep now I will fain know who be he that fly whether the pastor and he that have the care of soul or the friar who have no charge he who be oblige by state and condition and by divine law to a actual resid^n^^ what storm soever happen be it of plague of war of famine of persecution of heresy or any such like or he that be not type to any cure or charge and not have any obligation may retire himself from those afflict place may forsake his country the place of his abode and live where he like best yea and who peradventure may think with himself that it be but to tempt God to expose himself rash to the hazard of his life without any necessary obligation according as it be write he who love danger shall perish therein let we now put the last finger to this Evangelicall description of a shepherd and of a hireling the mercenary or hireling say s. John slye and he give a reason of his flight because he be a hireling and that the safety of the sheep concern he not because he be not charge with they but the true pastor who understand that the blood of his sheep must be require at his hand and that their salvation become a part of his own amaze with so many threat utter by the prophet against the bad pastor who abandon their flock in time of necessity he awake his solicitude he revive his courage he expose himself to labour and danger incline his heart to all the justification of our lord for the retribution which he expect from he alone let we now observe how our regulars behave themselves who be send unto this work only by delegation by mission of assistance by extraordinary commission as troop of relief and voluntary labourer this last sufficient declare the hireling fly because he be a hireling and have no care of the the sheep so as if he do labour in feed of they his labour be but voluntary and mercenary and according as it often happen most pitiful perform for as the regulars only govern such soul as of their own election without any obligation commit themselves unto their conduct so on their part have they the choice in this great harvest of what ear of corn they please in this great draught of fish which they like best cast the reave into the water to send they back unto their proper pastor in so much as the people do make use of they so long as they please so do not they serve the person of the world but so long and in such sort as they think best the place of their residence be that which be conformable unto their like like unto wander star to use the phrase of the apostle who influence work not so strong impression forsomuch as they cast not their beam but by way of passage whereas the sixed star be the aim whereby all mariner direct their navigation so this most learned and holy bishop well then understand reader thou see what author how many and of what quality who all flourish since the come in of the mendicant have sharpen both their tongue and pen against their disorder and wicked life whereas then some and those not of vulgar apprehension have tax i of indiscretion for inveighiug in my book against the fault of ecclesiastical person myself be of the same rank and profession for my part I undersland not their language for I have always hear that the maintain of pubsique error in doctrine and not the refute of they the commit of manifest impiety and not the reprove of they to be scandalous and the apostle give this charge unto i. Timoth. 5. such as sin public reprove that other may fear these man I see do wish i much good for they will have more wise more learned and more virtuous than s. Bonaventure then s. Vincent then s. Anthony of Milan then s. Richard of dundalke than Thomas Walsingham than Lanspergius than Laurentius then cardinal Bellarmine than Petrus camus bishop of bellay than many other who have labour in this kind and who for brevitye sake I be force to omit may these then make to the life picture of our deform Regulats with their black pencil of a deep reproof and shall not I be permit to draw one small line in their table shall these to the face of the world and in the eye of this sun strip and whip the friar at their pleasure and shall not I be license to lay on one single lash or be it that they have receive already their 40. stripe save one may these spiritual physician make deep incision and lance they with word more pierce than any two-edged sword and may not I be allow to rub their gall back with one dram of vinegar may these prelar and priest thunder in every pulpit against their error and abuse and not so content leave their invective in their work and monument to be read of posterity and may not I utter one little word but present I shall beserve with a citation from the spiritual court the court of conscience annunciate in Geth Ascalon etc. o publish it not in Geth nor preach it in the street of Ascalon lest peradventure the daughter of the philistine do rejoice and the daughter of the cumcised triumph for lord who see not how mistake and misapply that text be to the purpose that these man will draw it witted not David that the death of Saul and Lonathas and that victory in which the philistine prevail against the house of Israel can not be conceal from Goth nor Ascalon or any other city or habitation of the church enemy but David the more emphatical to express his grief in that desolation and heaviness of the synagogue in the slaughter other prince and people use that manner of threane or lamentation aggravate that day calamity in consideration of the great content joy and triumph that it will minister unto the philistine their victorious enemy so let we never persuade ourselves that our public error either in doctrine or manner can be conceal from those who be of a diverse belief from we neither they from our knowledge so long as we live together in the same commonwealth or border one upon another I speak of public and notorious excess^s for I never be of opinion that any personal or private delict the concealment whereof be neither prejudicial unto the church commonwealth or a three person may be manifest or disclose to which doctrine all divine applaud ground the same upon diverse text of holy writ among which this be one prov. 11. he who walk fraudulent reveal secret but he that be faithful conceal the fault of his friend and in the gospel math. 18. etc. if thy brother shall offend fend thou go and rebuke he between thou and he alone etc. see for this s. Thomas 2 2 2 q. 68.1.3 and q. 70.1.2 and in this sense no donbt it be that constant in the great that first christian emperor most christianly say that if he see a ecclesiastical man to do what be indecent or amiss he will cover he with his purple robe meaning he will so conceal his fault as neither the delinquent shall receive dishonour nor the church scandal thereby as for manifest and know offence we hear what almighty God have say by his prophet Isaiah 58. etc. cry out and cease not advance thy voice like a trumpet declare unto my people their wickedness and unto the house of jacob their offence still by his prophet complain of such pastor who like unto dumb dog either can not or will not open against the manifest vice and corruption of those to who they be send and the apostle exhort his scholar Timothy as to exhort entreat and beseech so to blame reprove and correct and that by his own example who so little fear the face of man as to comply with his apostleship he will free and public reprehend such as be manifest sinner and especial false teacher he will rouse out of their den and place the in the sight of the sun so 2. tim. 3. have make a long catalogue of public offence and offender which than infest the church conclude etc. and these avoid for of these there be who rush into man house and lead away silly woman into thraldom load with sin and draw away with many desire always learning and never attain the knowledge of the truth etc. and this not only or always in general but sometime he will descend unto particular not spare to rebuke notorious sinner by name for example in the chap follow demas have for saken i and be go into Macedonia Alexander the copper-s^^yth have she wed i much evil our lord will reward he according unto his work and this I think fit by way of a apology to allege in my defence as well for this present treatise now pen as also for such other book as I have heretofore write against the most know and notorious error and abuse of the mendicant especial of this country and kingdom with which I will conclude this chapter cap. 3 the power of the scapular and habit ever the soul in purgatory if blessedness be the end and of the reasonable creature consist in the clear vision and full fruition of the creator as our holy faith teach we two way after this life may a man be deprive of this bless vision through his own default either eternal which be a full separation of the creature from the bless vision of God the creator or a suspension for some time the former have with it a abdication unto eternal punishment depart from i you curse into hell fire the second have only a deputation unto the purge fire if any man work burn he shall suffer detriment but himself shall be save yet so as by fire now if the doctrine of our friar be good divinity all matter of the soul after this life be most sweet accommodate first for hell we have see in the former chapter the fire thereof quite extinguish only by die in the carmelite scapular or the franciscan habit so as a soul furnish with either of those commodity may say with the poet contempt and face now in this chapter it be considerable whether they be not as forcible to quench the flame of purgatory which if they do I be labour in fine we have no more to do but like jovial lad to pass our day in all pleasure and delight and a fig for what may betide we after death the second doctrine then of our carmelite be that whosoever die in the scapular he be not only free incendie sempiterne from everlasting fire but also from the purge fire at leftafr his departure within eight day after inclusiue and that be the long term for these be the word of their pretend indulgence I say pretend for undoubted it be never authorize by the see apostolic the work be these as they lie in that former abridgement of their privilege cite in the begin of this work and falsty father upon Clement 7. pope of that name by reason of this double I confess I be not so good a scholar as to make any sensible construction in english of these word notwithstanding that I have both learned my grammar and have myself compose one but yet we find by their sermon conference book and disputation that upon those word the friar carmelite conclude that by the benefit of the scapular every soul that be adjudge unto purgatory who body in death be invefted therewithal by the ministry and visitation of the bless virgin and under her conduct shall be deliver thence the next Saturday after their decease which as I say before must needs be at the long term within eight day after death yet sith the pain of purgatory be so grievous happy say I be they who die on Friday night because the day follow they shall be deliver thence now you must know that none have authority to give you this so holy a scapolar but such a priest as be of the order of the carmelite they have also in the aforesaid treatise another privilege grant as they say by pope Nicholas the 4. and pope innocentius the 4. but it be not to be believe but rather what Thomas Walsingham write cite in the former chap. that to be a friar and a liar be all one the privilege be this that whosoever shall give a alm or a night lodging unto a carmelite shall have a plenary indulgence of all their sin another privilege they father upon pope Vibanus 6. and Nicholas 5. that whosoever shall call the friar Carm^lites the brethren of the bless virgin of mount carmel shall have ten year of indulgence here be no ambition to be call the brethren of the bless virgin the mother of God and uncle unto our saviour to the imitation of which spiritual kindred and alliance it be very like that our Ignatian friar or jesuit albeit with more modesty do call themselves the fellow or companion of our saviour and of all friar I know none of so conspicuous descent and of so great a blood and house as these two the carmelite to be the brethten of the bless virgin the ignatian to be the companion of jesus but why not since our saviour have say math. 12. whosoever shall do the will of my father that be in heaven he be my brother and sister and mother sith then our saviour be content to admit into his kindred such as shall do the will of his father without exception of person of what quility soever from the cedar to the hyssop from the pope to the sexton from the prince to the beggar to what end be these restriction these singularitye of style and title import a limitation or rather a kind of a exclusion of their brethren from such spiritual prerogative especial our saviour have leave they to the general extent of a whosoever shall do the will of my father he be my brother sister and mother for tell i why shall not a cobbler under a stall or a poor woman sell her bunch of radish about the street who have a care to live in the fear of God assume these stately and honourable style as well as either carmelise or jesuite albeit I confess it will nothing become they so to do our saviour bid we when we have do our best endeavour say we be unprofitble servant the pope call himself the servant of God servant the publican be commend for not lift his eye to heaven but knock his breast and call himself a sinner the prodigal child hold it too much to be call his father son the invite guest be command to take the low place at the table and we know who say to the apostle contend which of they shall be the great voluer be minister etc. math. 23. he that will be the great among you he shall be your servant and he that exalt himself shall be humble and he that humble himself shall be exalt and albeit it please our saviour sometime to grace his follower with high style and term full of love and honour as he who know the worth and merit of all his servant as for example to call they his friend his brethren his fellow-heire his child his disciple his servant yet it become not poor silly and wretched man who either know his own misery in this valley of tear or be more miserable in be ignorant thereof to approach near unto his creator than the Portall of shall I speak unto my lord be but dust and ash not know whether in this life he be worthy of love or hatred a vessel of honour or dishonour but that whatsoever good he have be by grace from heaven and not of himself and so much for the power of the carmelite scapular in matter of purgatory the sum of all who doctrine in this point be that the bless virgin the mother of God descend from heaven every Saturday but whether before noon or after it be uncertain to deliver all such as have die in the scapular the week before the occasion of which suppose privilege as far as I can conjecture be this the carmelite friar hear that the franeiscans do preach and publish unto the people that s. Francis every year upon his feast day which fall upon the 4. of octob. come down from heaven and descend into purgatory carry away with he all those who the year before die in his habit and desire by all mean that their scapular may not be inferior but rather in great request and estimation then the habit and think a year too long a time for poor soul to be torment in those flame they obtain a privilege as they tell we but most false from the sea apostolic that their scapularist shall stay no long than a week at the most but every Saturday shall be deliver thence so as I do not a little wonder wherefore the friar of s. Francis order in limericke of late shall with so great vehemency and as it be with a new heat set on foot that former pre^ended indult of a yearly manumission upon s. Francis day of all such as die in their habit be^o^e the particular of which history curious reader if thou desire to under stand I will not spare to impart unto thou and that in such man as be relate unto i by they who be eye and c^re-witnesses of the whole business with all the circumstance thereunto belong Philip horrow parish priest of s. John baptist in the south part of Limerick second vicar general unto the bishop of limericke who name be ri. Arthure preach upon s. Francis his day the 4 of October namely 1633 in the house of the franciscan and among many other praise of s. Francis say that the saint do every s. Francis day descend from heaven to purgatory and deliver from thence all the soul of such as have take s. Francis habit in their life-time this be contradict by the dominitan and the jesuit of limericke and thereupon the vicar general Philip horrow be call before the bishop and before his adversary and be question about that doctrine which he have deliver he say for his part he do not firm believe it but yet he cite two author of the franciscan for it these be Onuphrins mariscal and bartholomens pisanus whereupon he and his adversary be reconeil and by the bishop enjoin not to speak any more of that opinion but the guardian of the franciscan in limericke Friar Francis wolf hear this prepare himself to preach of that subject on the 29 of December last which be the Sunday but the bishop hear thereof be most vigilant and careful of the peace and concord of his flock send his archdeacon father jordan bourk and father William Sauvegan his Chantor first to entreat the say guardian not to speak any word of that controversy and next to command he not to preach thereof the which message they deliver unto the say guardian upon Saturday night before his sermon and he with some colour speech make they believe he will obey yet the next morning he preach the same opinion with great vehemency against the other regulars hereupon the bishop call all his clergy of the city and the regulars together the 15. of jan. very late at night and there the regulars especial friar Terence o Brian prior of the dominican in Limerick and friar William crah superior of the jesuit also in Limerick accuse the say guardian of the franciscan aswell for that opinion as also for his unseemly language against other that gainsay that doctrine whereupon the say guardian after some frivolous excuse give by he be command by the bishop not to preach any more within his diocese without his especial licence he cite no more author for the same opinion but those which be cite by the vicar Philip horrow and thus have you the true relation of such trouble as happen among our churchman of Limerick this last winter about the privilege of the franciscan habit in which as in a map you first behold the venture and broacher of false doctrine in the person of the vicar general and the guardian of the franciscan in the second place be present unto you the office of a good pastor and the careful performance of his duty in the bish of the diocese three you be to observe the comendable obedience of the vicar general unto his ordinary be admonish of his fault four you may note and detest the intolerable pride and schismatical disobedience of Friar Francis wolf guardian of the franciscan who be praadmonish by the diocesan not to preach such doctrine and countersayt a feign obedience do notwithstanding transgress his commandment to the notable scandal of God church and the ruin of his own conscience last you may observe some laudable opposition make againsterror and false doctrine by the accusation of the prior of the dominican and the superior of the jesuit now I will know of our friar and especial of friar Francis wolf guardian of the franciscan of limericke what privilege or indult they have from the pope to preach such doctrine as be inhibit they by the bishop in who diocese they live contrary to the decree of the council of Trent sess. 5. cap. 2. and both the rule of s. Francis cap. 9 and the aforesaid council forbid they at all to preach the bishop not give way thereunto sess. 24. cap. 4. but experience from time to time have teach we that they be too violent and headstrong to be rule by any church law neither let the reverend bishop of limericke be trouble with their disobedience unto he for the pope himself shall not be able to command they further than stand with their own good like to which purpose it shall not be from the purpose to set down what that reverend pious and learned bishop of bellay in France johannes Petrus camus observe at his be in Rome in the late day of Clement 1. and I will use his own word as they lie in the 32. cap. of his book be on a time in Rome in the day of pope Clement 8. who memory be in benediction and in a sweet odour of sanctity for his verity equity and mansuetude who be much urge not to say importune with many question and dispute touch the habit and beard of cloysterman he have a resolution to bring unto the razor and unto the hood all such as call themselves regulars and who live in communitye and observe monastic vow this give such a alarm to they who have take the cap and the habit of secular clergy the jesuit and theatine and a other sort who have make choice for their character the long beard I mean the conventuall carthufian and capuchin that it be much to be fear that the good pope who name be in veneration through all christianity have not feel the effect of those mortal litanye with which some monk do threaten those who be not favourable unto they for sure have he but touch the check of the one with the razor and have thrust the head of the other into a hood he have try their resignation and obedience to the quick but to avoid trouble and jealousy the good pope hold it better to let that business sleep then to taste the humour of his froward and discontent child so the bishop but of much more terrible consequence be that other case which happen in the same most bless pope day myself be then in Spain in Sevil of Andalusia about the year 1600 for pope Clement 8. be to determine the controversy Anxili^s so long debate and yet depend undecided betwixt the dominican and the jesuit the jesuit to give a disturbance to that work and to cast it quite from off the hingell lest it shall be judge against themselves cause it to be dispute through all their college of Spain and Portugal and that in print and public conclusion fid Clement Papa octa^^^ that it be no point of faith that pope Clement 8. be head of the church and because the spaniard in their dispute make use of their own language yea much more than of the latin and there be many cavallero ae man of great fashion then present as well as of the vulgar according to the manner of solemn disputation there go a tumultuous buzz among the laity in their meeting and conversation Qu^ no es cabeza de Iglesia what the devil be not the holy father the head of the church so as the inquisition hold it necessary under pain of censure to inhibit those question and dispute and in truth the good old pope fear by such disputation to be dispute out of his chair be content to surcease from any further process in that assayre cap. 4 that the regulars of this kingdom be neither roman catholic protestant nor good subject and therefore neither by the church nor commonwealth to be permit to live among they first that the regulars be no roman catholic it may appear by what have already be dispute in the matter of the habit scapular and the luissian fast ascribe salvation unto they contrary to the faith of holy church beside the maintenance of the eleven proposition of which they have be both convict and judge in their book late make by edmundus censure and condemn at Rome contrary to which censure the say book be allow and approve of by all the friar of this kingdom and for so much as the friar be not conformable on the other side unto the protestant religion establish in this kingdom and I can never learn that his majesty be please to allow of any three religion within his dominion I say more than the approbation of the protestant and some gracious toleration of the catholic no more than he be please to allow of Arianisme Nestorianisme Pelagianisme and the like heresy in consideration whereof whensoever it may seem good unto the king and the state what cause can be imagine why the friar of this kingdom may not be prosecute as most pestilent heretic and seducer neither be there want of precedent and example in the protestant church of such proceed against infamous heretic for so in berne of Helvetia be Valentinus a italian heretic adjudge unto the fire Servetus a Spaniard in Geneva in the day of queen Elizabeth Hacket and legat execute in London for Arianisme other in Norwich penry hang at Th^^ford greenwood and Bar^ in lincolnes-inn-field all of they for maintain and publish of Brownisme but if it be think better to those that sit at the helm of government to show more mercy then may they be send out into exile after their predecessor those false monk Prebinus Probinianus who by Pelagius the pope be banish into remote land as we read in gratian'ss decres. 16. q. 1. Prebinum for one way or other it seem necessary that the kingdom shall be purge of they who to enrich themselves and make-up their monarchy regard not what slide stair they make the people to descend from Christianity to atheism and albeit the beginning have be marvailous neglect and neither the cookarice crush in the egg nor these harpy in their first hatch yet better late than never before they grow to a strong head and not so easy to be suppress and so much brief for the exorbitant heresy of our regulars condemn both by the Catholic and Protestant by which separation from both they have frame a new no. church unto themselves worthy no where to be admit in the second and last place I be to prove according unto my promise that the friar of this kingdom be no good subject and so also in that respect rather deserve punishment than either favour or protection from the state under which they live and so I argue in those better and more religious time of our ancestor and when the Catholic faith do most flourish in great Britain ta^ne and the isle adjacent when our king bishop noble and commons be all of one heart and lip in the worship and service of God when the canon law and behest of holy-church be in most rigorous observance yet even then and in those day no archbishop bishop or prelate take upon he or may by virtue of any ecclesiastical call or dignity to banish either out of the land or any one district dioccesse or county any of the king subject of what call so ever or for what cause so ever and albeit metropolitan bishop arch deacon and other prelate be of as great power and as ample jurisdiction in those time as any of their successor have be since yet notwithstanding all suit against ecclesiastical person of what quality or degree soever in civil and secular cause as debt rent revenue lease inheritance and the like be both commence and determine in the king temporal court and not at all in the bishop consistorye as appear both by the ancient law of these kingdom and the consent of the learned professor thereof who all with one voice as well catholic as protestant do at this day agree in the premise notwithstanding all this our new titulary bishop especial so many of they as be send unto we out of the friaryes beyond-sea together with the whole Regularism^ of this kingdom do stout maintain both by doctrine and practice the contrary first that they have power to banish if they be archbishop out of their province if bishop from out their diocese not only for offence but even and at their own will and pleasure without either examination or determination of cause any of the king subject aswell of the temporal as ecclesiastical second they teach and practical maintain that whensoever the defendant be a clergy man not only in ecclesiastical hanse but as well in temporal and civil as debt mortgage lease rent etc. they be to be implead before the bishop of the diocese in which they live and not in any of the king court at all in defence and justification of both which paradox tho. flemw titulary Archb. of dub in stiff persist for that indeed within the diocese of Duklin he have practise both those point notwithstanding that his error be with much mildue and learning both out of the canon and common-lawe open unto he by one of his majesty privy council yet can he not to this day be reclaim but remain most wilful and obstinate in his former practise error his friar persuade he to offer himself a sacrifice in defence thereof lay a imputation upon all such as complain of this his tyranny that they seek his blood not doubt but one way or other to prevail in this his usurpation notwithstanding what opposition soever of the high power against he and like unto this our archbishop Fleming be another franciscan the present bishop of down of the house of Maggennes a man in his behaviour more like a italian Bannito or some debauch ruffian than a sacred bishop as may well be see by his fantastic accoutrement couple to his manner have his lock hang over his rich face and down his shoulder even to the centre of his back strut himself at every three word upon his tiptoe as if he be angry at his parent for not make he a foot long and if any think my pen have wrong he in this rough draught let they make a pilgrimage unto he he live not above two day journey from Dublin and if they find he not as I have present he let they come unto i and tell i of it and I will congratulat with they his reformation this Hugh Magennes transform first into a friar and after into a bishop retain still the first savour and season of the pot meet late witha clergy man of these part ask he now what do Cadde^ and Harris do they live still in Dublin yes be I their bishop as if every hair of his head be able to transport they beyond the aequinoctial I will send they further off by your favonr my lord caddel and Harris be civil man and as they be catholic priest so be they the king liege subject and may live in Dublin or where else they think good within his majesty dominion so long as it please the state to permit they be far from yield to the new usurp tyranny which your friar bishop have of late bring into this kingdom contrary both to the common and canon law as have be demonstrate unto they not only in my late treatise against the. Fleming his excommunucation but since that again most learned in the castle of Dublin by such as have the examination of the cause neither be it to be think that his majesty will endure such a diminution of his honour by any one friar or the whole pack of they together in the mean time God help the poor priest who live under the friar bishop to who if they do not yield in these and the like practice they shall present hear veteres migrate you shall no long live in my diocese which thunderclap be first hear in Dublin but afterward roar into other diocese yea such vexation they find especial priest of the best part and under the friar bishop as to redeem their vexation and to purchase their peace they be content to forsake their parish and poor entertainment and to betake themselves unto other diocese where the clergy-bishop govern leave all to the friar who desire to do all and have all and for this cause be it together with ambition and a unbridled lust of domineer that so many friar at this day do hunt after bishopric as wear credible inform both from Paris and Rome no few than eight of they to the admiration of stranger and deteslation of all modest man importune the pope to be make titulary bishop of this kingdom there be searce so many place vacant which if they do obtain the utter ruin of the clergy in those diocese can not be prevent who they will not fail to supplant and to furnish their place with friar each one of his own order as we hear daily to be practise in the next diocese of Kildare who bishop be a dominican Friar create his friar parish priest contrary to the law of holy church and continue practice thereof till these time but see the policy of this tyrant bishop or rather tyrones bishop of Kildare for at tyrones intercession be he nominate as himself can deny have first write unto the pope as be credible report and believe by we that no bish shall be name by his holiness in this kingdom but such as by Tyrone from Flanders shall be commend unto he I say this ross magogean titulary bishop of Kildare in excuse of make his friar pastor and parish priest contrary unto the law of the church tell such as expostulate the matter with he that of necessity he be enforce so to do for that out of the body of the clergy he want priest of sufficiency for those place o bless God have first discontent banish wrangle and clamper all priest of worth out of his diocese and have first procure that desolation make afterward his own fact a excuse of his own wickedness shall Machiavelli ever be dead so long as this friar be alive to such miserable term be the clergy of this country bring that if the pope as he have begin to send we either bishop make of friar or of the friar creature there be a end of the secular priesthood which be of Christ institution and have continue in the ch^rch since the apostle time till this unhappy tyranny of the friar have corrupt both the doctrine and government of the church and have turn all thing topsy-turvy among we if any desire to know the name and number of our present friar bishop of this kingdom they be as follow Them Fleming alias barnwell alias white archbishop of Dublin franciscan boethius Igan bishop of elfin franciscan Hugh magenue bishop of down franciscan ross Magoghagan bishop of Kildare dominican Patrick Cumberford bishop of Waterford augustin which last be the only indifferent friar bishop unto the clergy of all that ever yet be send into this kingdom some other we have who albeit they be elect out of the body of the clergy yet because stand upon their own foot they be not able to reach the apple of episcopal promotion they mount upon the friar shoulder and by their alone mean have obtain the same and for that cause be little more love unto the clergy or less belove of the friar than the former hold it a point of gratitude and the least kind of remuneration for so great a benefit to be at the beck and command of that friar whether it be Wadding the cordelier or any other by who solicitation they receive their nomination unto a bishop rick bind ever after to tread in their step and to run their course but sure for my part I shall think the same church-pollicy which be practise in Rome in debar friar these 50. year and upward from the apostolical chair may be observe through the whole church as best beseem the ecclesiastical hierarchy and the government thereof I mean the clergy to be govern by the clergy the friar by the friar without make such a mixture of government as we see at this day one diocese rule by a clergy bishop another by a franciscan the three by a dominican etc. which be rather to lay a corner stone of dissension than any foundation of unity to plant a seminary of discord and contention than a nursery of peace and concord and the same not only for the present but even descend unto posterity for example in this diocese of Dublin we have for the present Thowas Fleming archbish a friar by all mean suppress and persecute h^s poor clergy wear out all the most ancient and sufficient i'riest of his diocese and to the end he may with more facility at chieve his end he have jate procure a bull from Rome the ground of this bust be for that all benefice of this kingdom for want of due collation be hold to be in the lapse and devolve thereby unto the gift of the pope by which be confer unto he the right of patronage and presentation of all the benefice rectorye vicarye capellania yea not they only but the collation of all digaitye place of channon prebend or what else belong unto the cathedral or collegiate church within his diocese all at his disposition will and command either to confer or to be vacant as he do the dignity of s. Patrick and Trinity church for fear of create a chapter which one time or other may look into his game some parish he confer especial upon his white disciple in other and the most with amovibility to the end they may be more serviceable unto he all to give a free scope and a uncontrollable licence unto his gallop friar to command all among who there be not a lay brother who be but yesterday a horseboy but will threaten the grave priest of his diocese with a removeall from his place if he distaste he and very the present government of the clergy in this and such diocese as the friar bishop do rule make i call to mind that tyranny of the dane as well here in Ireland as in England to who violence not only the republic in general but every private family be obnoxious have their espial and intelligencer in every place and corner of the country in so much as unto the base groom among they for fear of his displeasure the honest subject be in such thraldom as he will be glad to give he the best place at his table and to feed he even with the best morsel he have and to call he at every word my lord Dane whence it come to pass that in these day we call by contraction every idle vagabond a lordan borrow I say from that lubber of a Dane who be appoint to domineer in every man house yea if my memory fail i not which be the first faculty of the mind that decay in old-age it be write in some of our chronicle that if a english man have be upon the midst of a bridge and have see a Dane make towards the same though a musket shoot before he the saxon will have return back again and have leave the bridge unto the Dane to have pass over and even such lordane for all the world be our irish friar help to devour the fruit of the earth for which most of they never swear it in any lawful vocation absolute command the whole household in which they live and all too little to do they service respect and honour those that be housekeeper do more feel then myself understand the discommodity of the saucy and malapert carriage of these sturdy beggar among they it be on a time when a friar of s. Francis Order come to a gentleman house seat within the smoke and prospect of Dublin and find the gate shut for why the goodman of the house with all his family be set to dinner neither be there write over the gate porta paten the friar seeing-himselfe thus prevent and his stomach persuade he that he be in extremeinecessity of his dinner he betake himself unto the hammer of the give and so belabour the broad pail as I know not whether Brontes the great smithy man with his big hammer fetch from his right care can lay weighty stroke upon his anvil but so it be as the friar find the proverb true the belly have no care and no admission or answer can he get notwithstanding that by reason of his importunity he persuade himself have they be all in bed and fast in sleep they will have rise and minister unto he and no question but as his hand do labour at the hammer so do many a cogitation hammer in his brain sometime bewail the decline of hospitality through the kingdom the hardness of rich man heart sometime again bethink he of the virtue of perseverance comfort himself with these and the like promise and and ask and you shall receive knock and it shall be open unto you but nothing do more trouble the friar mind then when he fall into consideration of that legacy of s. Francis write under his image common at their altar that in what place so ever his friar shall be they never shall want necessary food or raiment the truth of which legacy he find his stomach now to call in question o how often do he examine the gate whether the weather or worm or time more consume than either worm or weather have make any little window by which he may espy some bless body to pass over the base court within but all in vain for assoon may he have look through the rib of the trojan horse what will you have of it wrong patience turn into fury the friar gather up a number of stone as David do when he go to let fly at Goliath his head though far big for this friar be aluf bounce cordilier and not such a shrimp as David be these he throw against the gate of Droncondran with many a vengeance upon all those who keep their gate so close shut against friar but alas as Priam dart rebound back when they arrive at Pyrrhus his armour of proof accuse the weak and feeble arm of the thrower so do the stone which friar John Preston send against the aforesaid gate leave some few dint of his doughty choler but nothing which may relieve his hunger at last the friar all malcontent betake himself unto his palfrey and with a froward kind of patience pursue the rest of his journey but time pass on with swift though silent pace not long after he meet with old John bath who soul God pardon he relate what a challenge he make he what document he give he among which I remember this be one what wist you but that the best and dear friend you have may have be at your gate at that hour it be against the law of hospitality and the custom of Ireland to shut their door at meal time etc but betwixt we both he either forget to tell i or I to demand what satisfaction be make for that error and now I wot well what the friar will say or other for he alas Mr Harris be this all you have to say against that ancient guardian and now a definitor of his order it seem if you have worse it shall out o no I keep the rest for my book which I hope ere long shall see the light if they amend not and now betake myself unto a more serious discourse I will conclude this chapter cap. v. whether it be true martyrdom to die in defenes of the two former tenant hold both in theory and practice by our archbishop tho. Fleming and his friar much do our Archb. Fleming glory that in and for the defence of the libertye of the church he be persecute both of the state and some of his own profession but for his part as they seek his blood so be he most ready and willing with s. Thomas of Canterbury for the immunitye and privilege of the church to lay down his life that so he may aspire unto the glorious crown of martyrdom and sure if the pope and cardinal in Rome be as forward as he and his friar be here I perswede myself he will be canonize before his death and so be a second s. Thomas but then how a martyr there indeed will be the difficulty and therefore the state may do well in the mean time to make he a confessor that be to acknowledge his fault and presumption in violate such law as both church and commonwealth in all age from our very cradle of Christianity in these kingdom have maintain conformable to the law of God and fit for government as I have abundant declare in my book against the archbishop Fleming his excomunication and this I speak in excuse of his first error the mother whereof have it be iguorance may by a humble submission be make pardonable for indeed Thomas Fleming be take from his friary of lovayn at the age of 30. year and so be sudden advance unto the second primacy of Ireland human negotiation of interpose mediator raise he from the dunghill even to sit with prince with the prince of his people to who if that power which can in a moment and set he aloft have also furnish he with part befit government there have be no cause of complaint but the man be take as he be and in a new mould can not now be cast a friar he be and to have a friar archbishop of Dublin be the ambition of all the friar in Ireland who they presume and therein be not deceive that he will ever smell of the first humour with which he be season notwithstanding david take from the flock and from behind the bag ewe as himself confess psal 77. and post foetany and advance unto the sceptre of Israel do not after look back either to the ram or to the ewe or their young one he leave behind he but as Solomon say of a wise man he have always his eye in his head he look before he forget what be past endeavour to perform with that present estate to which he be call have I con fesse this advantage that he who raise he have both the power and will to bestow upon he the spirit of wisdom and all other gist and grace necessary for so high a call by which we may take knowledge by the way of that distinction handle by the schoolman and in particular by s. tho. 1a 2 19 q. now then tho. Fleming by God permission raise unto the second see of Ireland at the age of 30. and as it be determine by his brethren and camerado in the friary of Louvain to extirpate the clergy of the diocese of Dublin and in their place to bring in the friar a plot though not very ancient yet before he invent by a VIster friar call Hugh Cavall reside in Rome and design by this present pope Vrbanus 8. about ten year ago archbishop of armagh and primate of Ireland and to which purpose the aforesald Hugh Cavall obtain a bull by most sinister information to make his friar parish priest through the diocese of armagh but be prevent by death before he can pay his way and bid his friend farewell in Rome albeit not two hour before his death he write a letter unto the pope beseech he to in his place friar rob. Chamberlain for so they call he albeit a most irish and a tyronicall friar of Louvain a successor be design in his place a priest of the clergy call Hugh o Reyly the present metropolitan of armagh and primate of all Ireland who be a man not so wed to friar plot against the clergy albeit in many respect obnoxious unto they that policy of make friar pastor either end in the first Hugh or at least have take a time of breathe in the second Hugh but our young friar Fleming a archbishop of 30. year though now near 40. nothing doubt to under-go that burden which Milo himself be scarce able to bear and in a preposterous zeal he will yea that he will without either bull or banish the secular priest out of his diocese which to perform little see in the canon of the church and less in the common law of England not distinguish the key from the sword nor regal power from episcopal jurisdiction like a Prester John king of the aethiopian he present banish 3. priest in his opinion the most fussicient of all his diocese and these live in Dublin the mother city of all Ireland not doubt but they once send away all the rest will be glad to kiss his hand and to depart with his benediction upon such lofty term stand our archbishop lean his head upon the elbow of his his friarly arm a arm or rather a army always ready and press to second such attempt as episcopal jurisdiction can not support yea to such a overween presumption do he and his friar at last arrive rely upon their own conrage and strength as they doubt not to complain unto the temporal magisttate and bring their matter unto the castle of Dublin confident that the state will join with they to the ratification of the banishment of the priest for which cause after that a layman have first break they and make the way for they there appear plaintiff William malone alias Morgan alias brown jesuite John Preston franciscan Patrick Brangan and Edmund doyle a pair of priest adhere unto the friar faction all these I say present themselves before a grave counsellor of state for as then the lord deputy be not arrive before he they accuse Mr Doctor caddel and myself Paul Harris for the three who name be doctor Cabil have make his peace before with the archbishop they lie to our charge but all in the cloud of generality as those usual do who mean to and to deceive allege that we be disobedient turbulent seditious of unquiet spirit enemy to peace in conclusion such as do trouble all Israel and therefore not to be tolerate or long endure but it be their chance good hap for we to come before such a judge as hold it necessary to keep one ear for the defendant and first to hear our answer before he condemn we have understand that of the moral philosopher elegant express by the tragedian who determine any thing either party unheard though what he determine be just yet himself be not just Seneca in Medea wherefore it please that honourable gentleman after he have give audience unto our adversary first to send for i Paul Harris to understand what I can answer in my defence not have in nine year before be within the castle-gate of Dublin and next after he send for Peter caddel who as I take it before that time have never see the in of the castle and have hear our apology the bell for the present be stay and that great heat of hasty exile begin to coole-soon after this be the happy arrival of the present lord deputy before who upon petition both the archbishop Fleming and we the priest be command to appear and our grievance propound be grations hear and for that time dismiss with grave advice how to frame our obedience unto the law of God and the kingdom and the archbishop Fleming in particular be most serious require to reform his error but he stand upon his justification and want at that rhyme as it seem unto we the gift of utterance and expression of himself whether not acquaint with such a audience or that he be not provide of his answer he desire again to be hear and soon after by the lord deputy his command we be remit unto the hear of the now lord bishop of derry and sir George radotiffe knight before who all our cause be examen at full according unto the canon of the church and the ancient and immemorable law of these kingdom and the archbishop Fleming convict partly by his own confession and partly by witness that he have offend in these two point first in take upon he to banish the king subject by episcopal authority out of his diocese second in erect a new tribunal and draw all cause of eccelesiastical man though mere civil and temporal unto his consistory there only under pain of excommunication to be hear and determine neither can the aforesaid Thomas Fleming parallel his cause with s. Thomas of Canterbury I appeal to all such as have write the legend of his life and death whether it be Capgravius the breviary or our english chronicle neither out of any other history shall our friar ever be able to prove that in both or either of those two point there be any controversy at all betwixt king Henry the second and Thomas Becket Thomas Fleming the friar be the first and only bishop since the conversion of these nation to Christianity that ever be bold to teach maintain or practice the same for which if he shall suffer death notwithstanding all the ruissian-like boast of he and his friar he shall die a malefactor and not a martyr but the little fear of any such punishment to befall he cause he and his fryats so to triumph over those who to their power have and always will endeavour to maintain that harmony and concord which time out of mind have be betwixt the law of the kingdom and the canon of holy church and very our hope be in God and next in those to who hand the sword of justice be commit that they will not see the church in her ancient law the king in his honour or the subject in his right any long prejudise by such our and wander limitour as be able by their busy insinuation persuasion negotiation if they be no soon suppress etc. towards who to use lenity will be but cruelty and the severity of justice the great benefit of mercy cap. 5 a apology of the author for the sharpness of his style some say there be too much gall in my ink especial write against those that be of the household of faith who albeit they have wrong i my friend or the clergy yet ought not I to exceed the moderation of a faultless defence that be so defend myself as not unnecessary offend other etc. alas and will not these man yet understand that I write not at all against any of the church child or family but only such as s. Peter inveigh against in his 2. epist 2. allw unstable soul have their heart exercise with avarice the child of male diction leave the right way have err follow the way of bal^am of Bosor which love the reward of iniquity etc. such wander star of which s. jude speak who retain nothing but their erratical motion have lose both light heat and influence such as s. John in his first epist chap. 2 discover say they go out from we but they be not of we search the scripture and tell i be not the prophet of the old testament sharp even to scoff and bitter taunt against the false prophet do not our bleffed saviour in the gospel reproy both the doctrine and life of the seribe and pharisee eight time in one chapter cryout and Pharisei woe be to you scribe and pharisee hypocrite call they serpent and generation of viper read the epistle of s. Paul and the rest of the apostle unto the church consider what style they use against the enemy of the faith which they plant how edgy how gall how bite I come down to the father peruse s. aug. against the mantschee Calestius or jovinian s. Hierom against vigilantin helvidius and Ruffinus and tell i whether they bang they not with a style more sting than a whip of scorpion alas gentle reader what I have bring in this or any other of my book be but ale and cake to what the father and other champion of the church even to these time have write against the enemy of our holy faith but some will say that all the friar be not such as I have report they to be for which cause I ought to have make a distinction betwixt the good and bad the corn and chaff the sheep and wolf etc. and not send they all to the devil together in one bag as I have do for God forbid say these man and then they think they speak very wifely but there be some good holy and virtuous man among they both orthodox in belief and irreprehenfible of life no by the rood say I not one there be not a right believer among they and consequent not asleep good liver for if virtue and fall worship can walk together then both Turk and jew may be good and holy I confess there be indeed a number of smooth fellow to be tound among the regulars who have nothing but Obelle in their month such as can dexterous act g^^to the parasite part on every stage praise what you praise and dislike what you mislike who in the presence or in the procure of a benefactor if he by who they expect a benefit shall say he be very warm the friar will swear by his hood that for his own part he sweat downright know that a benefactor be a most delicate piece and must be tender handle I confess also some of they to be very moral and in the outward man not to be reprove and yet be infect with heresy be far from true piety neither herein do they go beyond ari^s and thousand of his sect what vice or corruption of manner can be lay to the charge of novatus or his disciple Pelagius Vigilantius and many more who life we find little or nothing tax by such as in their write have condemn they yet be they most vile and wretched heretic notwithstanding what morality or seem holiness so ever appear in their outward conversation according to that of s. aug. in psal 4. where there be not a sound faith there can be no true justice and it have be the custom of heretic from time to time observe by the father under the veil of formal sanctity to shadow their wicked doctrine now our friar be of two sort both naught and both misbeliever either the inventor and publisher of those damnable doctrine above refute or such as be their disciple do adhere unto they partaker of the same misbelief for if I can find but one friar among they that will disclay i those error that will either write or preach or any way publish in his perambulation the error of his fellow oh how I will stroke his head and embrace he how I will exempt he from the leaven and corruption of his fellow and will glory in his conversion but o fearful be that say of the apostle s John in his second epistle speak of the doctrine of the church if any man come unto you and bring not this doctrine receive he not into thy house nor say God save you unto he for he that say unto he God save you note the consent unto other in sin communicate with his wicked work now experience teach we that not only the learned friar but the unlearned and the lay-brother yea the more unlearned the more zealous itchy and busy be they in divulge among the ignorant people these salvation of habit and scapular hawk bell and hobby-horse how then can the one be more excuse than the other or why shall they not all be put in one faggot and send to the fire together so much then for the friar but yet my scrupulous reader desire to be further satisfy and that be in a second point demand as thus how can you Paul Harris be excuse for be so harsh in your write and so disrespective unto your ordinary as may appear by sundry passage both of this and other of your book especial be a priest of his diocese and live within the compass of his jurisdiction ought not a good priest with all reverence and respect both in his word and write to show duty and obedience unto his bishop according to that of s. obey your superior and such as be set over you and be obedient unto thy bishop and love he as the parent of thy soul to which I answer that indeed such be the privilege of bishop by the law of holy church that none may either censure they or publish and declare they to be heretic speak of such declaration as be intend by the canon but only the pope neither before such declaration according to the common opinion do a bishop loose his jurisdiction or the power of a pastor over his flock or in any of his three censure excommunication suspension or interdiction yet notwithstanding all this if a bishop shall obstinate maintain and publish any doctrine condemn by the church in a general council the least priest in his diocese may be so bold to call he a heretic and both preach and write against he for example of Arianisme Donatisme Pelagianisme and the like and yet remain subject to his jurisdiction notwithstanding for the voice of the church which be the voice of God be to be first hear and obey and to be prefer before any other and it be the rule of s. where two superior for example a general council and a bishop command opposite thing the inferior be not to be obey and conformable to this be that conclusion of s. thom. 2.2 q. 104.5 inferior in such thing alone be bind to obey their superior in which they be subject unto their superior and wherein those their superior go not against the precept and command of a power high than be they so s. thom. and in the corpse of the aforesaid conclusion he illustrate the same doctrine out of s. aug. ser. 6. by example of the captain the proconsul the general and God where neither the captain against the command of the proconsul nor the proconsul against the precept of the general nor the general against the command of God be to be obey by the subject but now what will you say if the. Fleming archbishop of Dublin do first exempt himself from all power and pastorship over his priest Paul Harris be Paul Harris then any long his subject sure by the rule of relative if he be not my pastor I be no sheep of his pasture I have either forget my logic orby the same rule and reason that he discharge himself of all cure care and command over i he exempt i also from all obedience and subjection unto he read then what follow witness by the firme and subscription of these two reverend and grave priest both live at this day within the diocese of Dublin we who name be here under subscribe do testify that in our presence tho. Fleming archbishop of Dublin do renounce all correspondency either by word or writing with Paul Harris priest cell we plain that thence for ward be never will receive either letter or petition from he or will meddle in any matter of he for he or against he but whole disclaim all jurisdiction and power over he wish we to signify so much unto therefore say Paul Harris which according we do may 24. 1631. peter caddel priest william Sher gold priest after this again two of his friar have threaten violence unto my person I send a petition unto tho. Fleming archbishop by the hand of two worshipful alderman my friend beseech he that he will by his authority and the law of holy church provide for my security his answer unto they be that he will have nothing to do with i in any cause whatsoever which alderman will not refuse at this day to justify the same last have certain book detain from i by a parish priest and a friar carmelite I send my complaint again unto he by the hand of a friar of his own order for unto his own presence he will not admit i who name be John Parry but after he understand than the petition come from i he neither will read or touch it but do grow into choler with the friar for present it unto he behold the equity the mildness the longanimity of a friar bishop his charitable and prudent government his care of administer justice unto a priest of his charge but I be a stranger and must be strange use and in place of protection make a prey not only to the wild beast of the forest but even unto the petulant and sturdy ram of the flock by all which it appear that I may true say and complain as almighty God do of the elite unto Samuel 1. reg. 8. they have not cast off thou but i that I shall not trule over they I have not cast off my bishop or withdraw my obedience from he but he have cast off i of which sort of desertion I persuade myself he will not be able to allege a precedent in the whole church of God well the vine be thus forsake of his stay the sheep deprive of the care of his shepherd as if with Daniel I have be throw into the lion den lord who tongue be not untie who tooth not sharpen against i and in i well I then find by experience what former I have hear that a man may live without father or mother but not without justice so than it happen as concern my book unjust detain from i no other remedy appear I repair for justice unto the present lord chief justice of the king bench to he I address my petition and by mean of his honourable command I recover they out of the hand of the injust detayner but what follow upon this very as the poet feign that in some storm all the wind have blow at one time according to that etc. so now all the whole regularisme of this kingdom from the four corner thereof monk dominican franciscan Augustine carmelite Capuchin jesuit with all their follower God know what a hideous tempest they raise against one poor priest how they rage how they storm and now the friar Thom Fleming who before have disclaim i for a sheep of his flock and will intermeddle in no cause of i with i or against i begin to assume afresh his episcopal jurisdiction over i and divulge i both in public and private assembly to be excommunicate and why forsooth for bring the priest Brangan by a warrant in the cause of my book before a secular tribunal upon this no man hence forward must eat or drink with Paul Harris no man may converse with he no man must salute he or bid God save he for why he be fall within the penalty of the canon nay rather he fall into the hand of a company of the eve who wound he and leave he half dead he have utter perish have not the good samaritan take compassion of he now albeit I have handle this matter in my late answer unto thom.

Harpsfeild as I take it be archdeacon of Canterbury in queen Mary her day and continue the ecclesiastical history of England from venerable bode his time to his own Rota be the very life and quintessence of the canon law so call from a know office in Rome call the Rota but neither of these book be with i for which I use the friar quotation and now the infirmity of my body not permit i to proceed further which for the space of these 2. month have much afflict i and daily increase upon i I be force thus abrupt to break off rather then to make a end beseech almighty God of his infinite mercy to grant i and all my adversary and all those who profess the name of jesus Christ to live and die in true faith hope and charity and so hope to see the good thing of our lord in the land of the live I take my leave of the world mundar but how true may I say with old Tobias great be thou o lord who do wound and heal who bring unto the gate of death and back again tob. 13. and so while yet we have time let we do good to all especial to the domestic of faith as the apostle advice we it be the office of a good pastor as well to seek the stray sheep as to feed the ninety and nine cap. 8 a objection answer there remain then a difficulty to be remove for some will well allow of my precedent discourse be it not for one block which lie in their way confess indeed that in all cause mere civil clerk be ancient emplead in the king temporal court neither say they be this to be mislike so long as these kingdom do stand constant in the profession of the catholic and roman religion but since they have decline therefrom and that the magistrate be now of a other opinion and profession in the service of God then in those time they be that of the apostle seem to take place write to the corinthian who have receive the law of our saviour do notwithstanding in their worldly controversy draw one another unto the heathen tribunal so be there not among you any wiseman that can judge between his brother but brother with brother contend in judgement and that before unbeleiver 1. cor. 7. now therefore say these man it be not lawful in these country to draw clergy man to the secular tribunal of protestant judge to which I answer that the argument which conclude more than it ought be always vicious and that reason which may be retort upon the arguer be ever inconsiderate propound for if that passage of the apostle be a precept and so bind under sin to obedience than not only the ecclesiastic but the lay catholic may not be compel to answer before such magistrate forsomuch as s. Paul speak general of all the faithful without any distinction and therefore our rhemist according to the universal consent of the father do understand the word of the apostle in the nature of a council and not of a command and happy I confess it be if that apostolical council and advice be follow namely that controversy and suit betwixt party which be many time commence for light cause and more out of stomach malice and revenge then of good conscience may be compose at home by friend and neighbour without this lawyerly plead at the bar the benefit whereof be common small and uncertain but the discommodity both great and apparent as loss of time expense of money with much disquietness and vexation of mind but this be a happiness rather to be wish then ever to be expect among such variety of will hnmour and disposition as the world more than ever abound withal but to hold it absolute unlawful for christian to wage law before public tribunal as it be at this day the heresy of the anabaptist so to deny that the roman catholic may convent or be convent in the court of such magistrate under who they live notwithstanding what difference soever in matter of religion smell very strong of the heresy of wicliffe condemn in the council of Constance forsomuch as it be the consent of all divine that no variety of opinion no error in faith no infidelity destroy or take away the power of the civil magistrate either supreme or subordinate such obedience then as heretofore be due unto catholic prince by their subject the same be no less due unto their successor of what opinion in matter of faith soever they be religion be but accidental and not at all essential unto civil principality ordain by God for the politic and peaceable government of mankind according to that 8. by i king reign and those who make law determine just thing if then clergy man be lawful convent in civil action before catholic prince and magistrate in time past as have be prove so no less also may they be before protestant at this day and the contrary doctrine of our friar and their follower be but a corner doctrine and of no good subject and if not of their own choice and free election it be both good for the church and common wealth and also for themselves that they may be force both to live and teach conformable to their holy institute and so happy there will be a end of all controversy betwixt the clergy and they a epistle of the author unto Thomas Fleming alias barnwell archbishop of Dublin as I begin with a epistle unto pope Vrbanus 8. now sit at the helm of s. Peter bark so it will not be impertinent by reason of some late occurrent to conclude with a epistle unto tho. Fleming archbishop of Dublin in the behalf of the poor distress clergy of his diocese if any marvel wherefore I do address my letter unto he rather in print then in private the cause be as I have declare in the 6. chap. that upon what humour or by who persuasion I know not he refuse to receive any letter from i send unto he by any private messenger yet what I publish in print I find that he most diligent peruse now for that my desire be he shall read what I write whether I be his friend as I persuade myself I be or his adversary as he suppose yet even from a adversary some benefit may be reap else have Plutarch never write his book of the commodity to be make of a enemy nor ever have s. monica the mother of that great s. aug. be teach to drink water have not her shrewd may the in her anger call she a wine bibber as s. aug. himself tell we in the 9 book of his confess chap. 8. you see then how I endeav our to comply with the archbishop humour and that to the example of diverse holy and learned man who have divulge unto the world those very same epistle which they have direct unto particular person without any private mission or signature sometime commend their good action sometime reprove their bad so s. Hicrom so s. Bernard admonish not only bishop and abbate but even pope and prince of their excess but it will be say that they be saint and I a poor sinner yet say I they be not know by that style when they write those epistle but with much more humility then doubtless be in i they confess themselves to be sinner and so of sinner become saint but to our purpose s. Paul write unto Titus who he have make bishop tell he that therefore he leave he in Crete to place priest by city as he appoint he tit. 1. 5. and in the same chap. he show of what quality and condition those priest shall be i think in s. Paul I hear the apostolical father pope Vrbanus 8. command tho. Fleming who he make archbishop and send into Ireland that he shall make and constitute priest in his and so indeed it can be deny but he have do for beside what have pass in the country we observe that in this city of Dublin in place of f. tho. coile pastor of s. michaells and in place of f. Luke Rochfort sometime pastor of s. Andeons he have constitute f. Patrick Brangan and f. Edmund doyle I say upon the decease of the 2. former who in their life time converse with such commendation in the house of God which be his church as they have leave behind they a sweet odour as well of their pastoral as personal virtue among we insomuch as their name and memory remain grateful to posterity now if those their successor before mention do in all vigilancy charity chaslity sobriety and longanimity emulate their predecessor than neither will the archbishop I know who design they unto those eminent place the 2. eye of his episcopal see nor the present incumbent themselves be offend with i for insert their name into this my epistle neither need they to blush or be ashamed thereof for so much as the apostle say that such priest as govern well their flock be worthy of double honour especial they who labour in the word and doctrine and to who no doubt it shall be say in that day serve bone and etc. well do good and faithful servant for that thou have be faithful in small matter I will set thou over great enter into the joy of thy master and so much for those 2. rectory or pastorship confer as we have see by the ordinary and upon what person now so it happen again as within these few week a three parish also become vacant by the decease of the late incumbent fa. William Donagh in s. Thomas street the suburb of Dublin and it be worthy our consideration to observe how our archbishop ever like himself proceed in the collation thereof we find that pope sometime by way of provision as the canonist term it to place of great dignity as archbishopric and the like have in the life time of the incumbent nominate their successor who upon the vacansie be to take possession of they so I take it that Anselmus and after he be prefer to the see of Canterbury to which imitation happy tho. Fleming Diocesian of Dublin either to show the superaboundance of his pastoral care or else to let the world understand how little he regard what opinion his clergy conceive of he make a designation of 4. several priest to that one pastorship the profit whereof will hardly pay for a man chamber and diet by the year and this he do during the life of the incumbent who decease one of the 4. enjoy it the other 3. be frustrate and what conceive they of this their archbishop deal but that they be mere delude and gull by he pretend great care of their preferment and mind no thing less sure if a farmer of fing all shall pass his promise in any matter of moment unto 4. of his neighbour which can be make good but unto one I wot well he shall be call but a cozen churl if a gentleman or a noble man shall do the like man censure happy may be more civil in term but their opinion not a whit the better for as their equal will disrespect they so their inferior will be sure to set their black mark upon they but for a man not only of a noble family but a priest and a archbishop who person be hold sacred to be find either with guile in their lip or gift in their hand what can we say but list up our voice with our saviour in admiration 18. the son of man come do you think he will find faith upon earh it be not i. it be not i who reveile no no I will be sorry so to do but even and japhet no less than cham have do it in trivy and in all conversation his letter his firme his seal his subscription be read be peruse be see be censure for so it follow to his love friend m. james archbald these be deliver dear father send for fa. lamar and deliver he this enclose and let he by his friend labour to get the good will of the best of the parish in case fa. William die as you write he be like to do but let none see the enclose until he die and let not fa. William know of it fear to trouble the good man who God comfort as wish your assure tho. barnwell this present Sunday the letter enclose in the former be as follow to his very love friend m. Martin delamar these at cromlin be deliver love fa. to my great grief I understand fa. William donough to be dangerous sick I pray you look to he and his parish and if God do call he to himself I do hereby give your r. in that parish the same power to minister pastoral sacrament and use pastoral function as he former have but I hope God will lend he a little long unto we his holy will be do recommend the next pare of your parish to cromlin to fa. ri. glackney the rest near palmerston to fa. Quin until I think further of the matter so desire God to assist good fa. William I rest your assure tho. barnwell April 20. 1634. notwithstanding the priest Dela mar forall these fair promise make unto he in his letter be disappoint of the parish and another place therein and it seem albeit the archbishop subscribe the letter he write he your assure Thomas barnwell yet it be but a complemental and a ceremonious assurance for the good priest find it nothing real at all as the event prove some be of opinion that when the archbishop intend otherwise then he write he than subscribe tho. barnwell but when he write as he intend than he subscribe his letter tho. Fleming be may we think such heathenism to rule in heavenly mind o no charity will make a more pious construction of such a prelate action wherefore I be rather persuade that the archbishop never fail to make good his word or promise unto any of which from time to time I confesse he be more challenge than all the bishop in Ireland I say that he never violate or break the same either as he be tho. Fleming or tho. barnwell or as he be of a noble house or as he be a priest or as he be a archbishop but only as he be a friar to which sort of people either lie be essential or sure in many man opinion proper mode and even in the judgement of that most pious and learned monk tho. Walsingham speak of the friar in these word not now first by i allege they have in such sort stain that their profession of truth by their unhappy live that in these day in every one mouth it be a good argument hold as well in form as matter this fellow be a friar a liar even as to say this thing be white and therefore have a colour so tho. Walsingham in the reign of Richard 2. fol. 266. but some will say to what end shall the archbishop use such double or to who benefit in confer of benefice be the water always so trouble among we I answer therein lie a mystery not yet reveil unto babe you know s. Paul wish that in the Churchall thing be do i. cor. 14. and so it be with we but how to the build up of the friar monarchy and destruction of the clergy for this be the common Antiphona sing in the irise church in these day up with the friar and down with the priest now for our archbishop albeit unto stranger and such of the laity as take no notice of his proceed these thing be hide and obscure yet the priest of the hierarchy who have summer and winter he now these ten year do feel understand the drice of his design neither in any thing do he more service unto the regular order then to make these embroylement in the confer of pastorship for first by these anticipate promise of one parish unto many none suspicious of any promise make unto other than himself our prelate observe which of they be most serviceable and dutiful unto his friar which of they be the best benefactor with their friend to he and his order which of they be like to prove to the rest of his own body and to prove the most factious against the clergy in side with the friar on who henceforward he be to have his whole dependence second by this precollation of benefice unto many the ordinary find which of they be like to prove the most gracious unto the parishioner and which of they be the most like to draw the good like love and affection of the laity unto he for that priest shall be assure notwithstanding all his golden promise to go without the parish for it be against the friar greatness that any shall be more please unto the people than their selve three by this confer of cure aforehand unto diverse party ignorant one of another it may be expect that every one of they arm with a promise from the bishop and he happy a far off in some friary in the country when they fall void that these competitor may enter into some scandalous contestation one with another every one think himself wrong by the other a occasion which the friar will not omit to take hold of to traduce they both in private and public assembly and for their sake the rest of the clergy as man seditious factious contentious covetous especial to and before the laity and all to alienate their mind from they like unto greedy miller every one strive to draw the grise unto their own mill notwithstanding that the same friar have be the plotter and incentor of all those difference last let it be always remember as a golden rule and the most principal maxim of their policy that the most insufficient pretender of any cure be the man that shall be ever prefer experience by induction of example have furnish we with that knowledge for a priest who God have bless with talent of learning and good part be a Aristides not fit to live in Athens but rather to be banish for it be conclude by our regular bishop that the friar must shine amid such blind curate like the moon among the lesser star you see my lo. I be no flatterer neither be the discontent of miss a benefice under you that make i so plain with you for notwithstanding that I have live in this kingdom now very near these twenty year you know neither myself nor any other for i do ever motion such a business unto you and albeit I hear some have wish you to thrust a steeple into my mouth and thereby to silence i yet I ingenuous confess soon shall old Eleazarus eat swine flesh then that I will swallow the same not but that to be a pastor of soul be a honourable vocation in God church but that I be now too old to be a friar horseboy no no let we have no new fashion in church government the old be the best and such as be ordain by our saviour let we keep our old priest and send back these swarm of friar over unto their monastery where they may live according unto their holy institutes and not here to sell their merit their prayer their penance and mortification yea not only of their own person but of their whole order and that under large seal patent unto cook for diet to merchaut for broad cloth suit to gentleman for horse etc. beside oppress a poor country with such shameless beg as little differ from mere rapine and extortion the church may subsist yea flourish without friar but not without priest as for many age it have do for be they white black or gray they be of a latter institute then the priest these be the successor of the apostle and the 42. disciple they of s. Francis dominick and Ignatius and of a distinct hierarchy if I be a John Baptist and preach in the wilderness without profit that be not my fault but the fault of they that will not amend their fault it be more please and contentful to i to come in the spirit of mildness then in the rod of correction if the subject be so dispose let those for who good I take all these pain both in health and sickness reform their manner and I will soon alter both my voice and style and I wish with all my heart that I have cause to say with the apostle if I have make you sad either by my book or by my epistle it repent i not for that you be so make sad unto repentance well to conclude all in oneword Paul may plant and Apollo may water but God be he who give the increase to who blessing I humble commend these my poor endeavour myself my friend my persecutor from the cell of my solitary recollection who wish your-Hon all-happinesse Paul HARRIS pr.
