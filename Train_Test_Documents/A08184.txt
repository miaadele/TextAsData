a funeral oration upon the death of the late decease princess of famous memory Elizabeth by the grace of God queen of England France and Ireland write by if the sigh of the heart be convert into eloquence of the tongue as in the instrument of breath the spirit be exchange into souned I will desire right worthy auditory that all those sigh which be assemble together in your breast may be center in my heart to the end that my defect of eloquence to express this fatal accident may be supply by my increase sorrow so happy convert into discourse but since this my conceit desire may not be reduce to act my wish be that this flood of tear that make his channel through our eye may like a river of fit discourse flow from out my lip to the end that the forecible weight of the same be inritch by these supply may plant amazement in your ear to hear the flow eloquence of my tongue and the boundless number of her praise but why spend I my breath in wish or to what end fashion I my desire to be great than my power since your reverend silence that attend my discourse be sufficient to give worth to the weakness of my performance and her virtue work wonder in the mean orator but because a good life make only the grave happy and the glory that be derive to after age depend on the action of forepast year let we discourse a while on that elizabeth life who death we lament with such hearty complaint she be bear of a father of famous memory Henry the eight derive from a mother of great virtue Anne Bullem and descend so royal and from so mighty prince that Europe know not her equal either in birth beauty or perfection great then Alexander she be for the world which he subdue by force she conquer by love her beauty be so great that it rather be envy then equal belove then praise admire then describe her power so great that whole kingdom be affright at her name and many rich country make happy by her protection her learning so admirable that as from east and west many nation resort to Rome not for any wonder they expect in the city but only to behold Livy so many from all part repair to her kingdom where either they be enchant with beauty amaze at her greatness enrich by her bounty confirm by her wisdom or confound in their judgement her chastity so great that the question be whether the conquest of her enemy wrought she more fame or the continence and government she have in herself more merit in a word she enjoy so much grace as all the grace possess not together and he that have the grace to see her grace account it his happiness to be so grace the desire her beauty kindle her modesty quench the attempt which ambition intend her constancy overcome the peace which all kingdom affect her policy effect and her state which her great foe envy her wisdom maintain her country be the fostress of banish man the sanctuary of the distress the harbour of the wrong the enricher of her ally the bane of her enemy in aword the world have nothing more praiseworthy in it then that it know she I will not rip up the rare perfection of her youth neither her fatal danger before her come to the crown nor her sundry good fortune in the government of her kingdom nor the continuance of her peace nor the prosperity of her war lest the memory of these thing add to her loss shall make our sorrow strong than our sufferance can admit of but for my own part I may say this of she that if this sovereign princess have die among those ancient thracian who weep at the birth of their child and sing and feast at their death they will have change their custom and bewail she infinite for by her death alas what misery be we not acquaint with we lose that head whereof we be the member the governess of our fortune and felicity the life of all our peace the death of all our joy since her departure justice scale be distemper prudence mirror be dim strength pillar be shake temperance vessel be empty the olive that peace bare be leafless the oil of mercy be waste liberality hand be close the head of magnificence droop pity have her smile change the law be silent and pardon tongueless alas what shall I say if Petrarch know not in what sphere of planet to lodge his Lawra how shall I guess in what order of angel I shall plant our Elizabeth dead she be but so dead as she be pity by death himself who be senseless and passionless towards all other creature yet have afford she this privilege to live in our sorrow and to give her place in heaven what mortal apprehension dare presume since in earth our best hope be wrap in fear and tremble and no man can beget that be for another which he can assure hope for himself what she be whilst she live we judge but by the outside the sense must inform the intellect before he can determine what she be for the earth we know for the soul we leave it with the platonist to infinity wherein God that know best of truth can inform truth when pelopidas the theban after he have manful combat against Alexander Pheraeus be unfortunate and mortal wound the report be that the thessalian that be present at that battle never lay aside their armour nor draw the reign from their horse neither tie up their wound until they have lament he arm and heat in the conflict they run to comfort he half breathless they clip their horse mane they shave themselves if cold make they chill the fire of their zeal will not suffer they to kindle fire in their tent their sorrow shut up their stomach from receive meat silence and mourn possess the whole army and they that have get a victory over fame by their conquest by the loss of their general become slave to their affection when the city hear of his loss the magistrate and mean man the prince and plebeian come out to meet he they fix crown on his hearse cast flower on his coarse and strive how to honour he be dead that have so faithful fight for they in life yea his enemy contend with the conqueror for funeral think it a blessing to enjoy his bone who valour have restrain their ambition if for pelopidas the warrior the greek be so passionate what shall we be in the loss of Elizabeth our peacemaker and princess who perfection be entomb in her enemy tear who loss have make the mighty weak the prudent diffident the rich suspicion the poor amaze and all sort hard pelopidas virtue be only the object of Greece Elizabeth the wonder of the world he only a subduer of a city or province she the terror of many kingdom he only wonderful in a angle she famous in the world fair but alas why talk I of death in so divine a subject she live as yet in the heart of her grateful subject because they may not die with she live they keep her alive in their love heart the memory of her death in their tear her name in their tongue her word in their ear her lively image in their last imagination her mightiness in she be a admirable miracle where nobility in the vicious be a grievous infamy here like a true joseph have she lose this cloak of mortality to obtain a immortal crown of glory and to escape the embracement of the lewd world how happy have she cast off the prison of her mortality how happy be she by death that be deliver from the trouble of life the enamour Thisbe to fly from the jaw of a hungry lioness cast off her veil that shadow her shoulder so this belove of Christ to escape that lion of perdition that rage wander to seek who he may devour have disburden herself of her earthly ornament have choke the ravenous enemy of mankind by cast her earth in his tooth happy happy Elizabeth that have forsake the Babylon of this world to obtain her country the heavenly paradise the moon as the philosopher write be eclipse by the shadow of the earth and nothing more obscure the soul than this prison of the body since therefore our Elizabeth have cast off her earthly veil to get a heavenly privilege let we moderate our passion by imagine her felicity since what she lose be not in her possession to keep and what she have be a great purchase than conjecture can apprehend the generous young man Crates forsake his possession to buy a heritage in philosophy Diogenes leave his country and house Democritus lose his eye to apprehend knowledge how far better a match have our sovereign make that for her possession in earth have get the paradise in heaven that for her earthly prison have attain a heavenly mansion that for her eye that behold the vanity on earth have get the mean to behold the paradise of heaven Plato in his law interdict the use of lamentation in funeral neither thought he it requisite to lament public or convey the coarse to his tomb with tear and sorrowful exclamation because as the philosopher say tear yield no remedy in tribulation but have Plato live to behold these time and consider the blessing we possess whilst she live how careful she guide the helm of commonweal and faithful defence her country from novation how provident she forestall the audacious design of her enemy how constann she withstand her great danger he will doubtless have remit a great part of his austerity and salute her hearse with some lamentable elegy there be a lake as Aristotle report near unto the river of Eridanus wherein if any poet fiction may bear credit of faith proud Phaeton be strike with lightning be final drown the water of this lake be in quality hot in odour grievous fearful in behold hereof no creature drink but he die heer-ove no bird fly but he be drown of the nature of this river be her loss we lament for the proud enemy that behold it be drown in confusion the tear that be weep on it blind the eye with their scald the odour that perfume her hearse be of the nature of vapour draw up by the sun which ascend in fume but descend in shower he that behold this hearse how can he choose but fear since over it he may meditate on the uncertainty of life what brutish or savage nature behold this sight and feed his eye on her monument but will die with sorrow or what soul hover in the air over this disconsolate hearse dissolve not into tear if exempt soul may be subject to passion I be amaze and can no more and your judgement shall require no further discourse at my hand the reason be because other glory may be express in word and writing whereas she can be apt describe but in wonder and silence I will therefore supply with my tear what I fail in my word and if any ask why I end so abrupt let the poet answer who can true judge of passion a true subject sorrow for the loss of his late sovereign I join not hand with sorrow for a while to soothe the time or please the hungry care nor do enforce my mercenary style no feign livery my invention wear nor do I ground my fabulous discourse on what before have usual be see my grief do flow from a more plenteous source from she that die a virgin and a queen you crystal nymph that haunt the bank of Thames tune your sad timbril in this woeful day and force the swift wind and the slide stream to stand a while and listen to your Lay. your fade temple bind about with view at every step your hand devout wring let one note fall another height renew and with compassion your sad naenia sing grace and muse wait upon her hearse three be the first the last the sacred nine the sad'st of which in a black tragic verse shall sing the requiem pass to her shrine a ebon chariot to support the beer draw with the black steed of the gloomy night stoop their stiff crest with a heavy cheer stir compassion in the people sight the pile prepare where on her body lie in cypress shadow sit you down forlorn who bow be dew with plenty of your eye for she with grief the branch shall adorn let fall your eyelid like the sun clear set when your pale hand put to the vestal flame and from your breast your sorrow free let cry one Beta and Eliza name upon the altar place your virgin spoil and one by one with comeliness bestow Diana buskin and her hunt toil her empty quiver and her stringles bow let every virgin offer up a tear the rich incense nature can allow and at her tomb for ever year by year pay the oblation of a maiden vow and the true vestal the most sacred liver that ever harbour a unspotted spirit retain thy virtue and thy name for ever to tell the world thy beauty and thy merit where be Collen Clout or Rowland now become that wont to lead our shepherd in a ring ah i the first pale death have strike dumb
