Robert blake his associate in commission with he to command they of new sally to surrender to he the town and deliver the captive that be the king of great Britain subject but before the alkaid and mr. blake come the town be unable to hold out long against the force of our english ship that they be in a manner near yield before the ambassador come thither so that under God our ship be the mean to reduce sally to the obedience of the emperor the right lord and owner thereof and also to redeem all the poor captive that be there christian so on the 28. day of July the alkaid with master blake go into the town and in the emperor name do place there their old governor and all the captive be send a board the king of England ship those that list to have a more ample relation of the surrender of this town with the other passage that happen there they may read a journal write by master John duntons direction who be the master of the admirall-ship the leopard who as it be think have describe it true but he be here and there wrong by the writer in misplace some thing unorderly be in number 302 english scottish and irish among who there be 11 woman also there be 27. french man which wise run away from their keeper and there be likewise set at liberty 8. dutchman and 11. spaniard all these great mercy of God to these poor captive christian ought never by they to be forget but with praise thanksgiving and amendment of life to be have in perpetual remembrance and we and they be all bind to love honour and obey our most gracious king who piety and pity be so great as to take the affliction of his poor subject so far into his most princely consideration as to send his ship under such wise and able commander for their redemption and it be a most remarkable note of the almighty mercy in that he stir up and ordain master Robert blake to be the agent and instrument to move the emperor of Morocco to be so well affect for their enlargement their slavery for the time be worse than the egyptian bondage under Pharaoh for imagine good reader what misery can be more than for a man or woman to be buy and sell like a beast for a Christian to be servile to a infidel in the most base and contemptible drudgery to eat the bread of sorrow and drink the water of affliction to have the head shave the body pine and beat to grind in mill to dig and dress vineyard to draw plough to be labourer daily and all their wage to be hard fare hard blow hard lodging and more hard than those never to hope to be free till death but hard and worst of all to be urge enforce and entice to forsake their faith and turn miscreant or at the best to be ever debar the exercise of the freedom of their religion and conscience now the learned do say that all kind of servitude be miserable but that especial be intolerable when a man be enforce to serve one that be dishonest and vicious and therefore as a wise man say it be better to live free with a little fear than to be in servitude with much and great abundance for liberty be sweet and worthy to be regard these and more than these be the insupportable calamity of our poor distress countryman with 46. of other nation who be now by God especial mercy and providence at liberty some of they have endure 30. year slavery and some few but all too much and too many in February last 1635 mr. Robert blake be a merchant and trade to Morocco by his good conversation and carriage there the emperor cast a eye of regard and favour upon he insomuch that he cause he to leave his merchandise and traffic in trust to his servant and factor and himself to be near attendant to his person in the court where his majesty take especial notice of his good diligence and integrity entertain a like to he and his service every day more and more so that in short space he purchase the office of farmer of all his port and custom which place he still retain there be then in the emperor court 33. captive who he and his father have former buy from Argeir and Tunnis and some of they have be in captivity 25. year some 20. year some 14 some few but each of they thought that the time be too long and although these man misery be not altogether so great nor their captivity so heavy in the court at Morocco as it be at Tunnis Argeir or sally yet be their thraldom so irksome to they that they have a desire to see their own country their mind run upon their parent kindred friend and acquaintance from who they have be long unfortunate separate so that their best mirth be but force and a kind of mourn and all their joy be too much mix with care and sadness which mr. blake with great grief of heart do note in they daily and his most sorrow for they be that he suppose he can not help they and therefore he do often see they with a eye of christian compassion and pity and in his mind like a true Englishman have a sympathy or brotherly feel of his with house for so large a circuit it have three castle two of they to the land-ward and one to the seaward with other strong cassamat and platform well furnish with great artillery from sally to Saffee be near fifty league more to the southward and there the ambassador take ship as be before-said and although I have write before in this relation that I have no skill in geography or description of country and climate yet for the satisfaction of many such as will not or can be at the charge to buy large relation it be not impertinent that I write somewhat of Africa and consequent of Barbary Morocco Fez Sus and other of those dominion with their religion manner rite law and cermony for their religion they be strict observer of the law of Mahomet they say Christ be a great prophet bear to be a saviour of the world but not incarnate that he be the breath of God that he be bear of a virgin and that the jew shall have believe in he but will not and therefore because they go about to murder and crucify he he leave they and ascend from they into heaven and that then they put another man to death instead of he who they torment and cruel crucify therefore these mahometan do hold and esteem the jew as the worst of man and very slave to all nation of the World the one and only book of their religion be call their Koran devise by their false prophet Mahomet who be of their nation a Larbee they may not use any other book for devotion nor on pain of loss of life no part of it do they dare to examine or question but if any be diffident or any point or sentence be intricate and hard to be understand by any of they than it be lawful to ask the meaning of the talby which be a poor weak learned priest they be all circumcise and they use a kind of baptism but not in their church but at home in their house their Lent be much about the time as it be with we which they do hold but 30. day and they neither eat nor drink all that time on any of those day betwixt the dawn and the twilight but when once the star do show themselves than for their day fast they feed fast all night that priest or talby that can read over the book of the Koran or mahomet law all over on their good Friday at night be hold unworthy of his place and function they say their prayer six time every day and night and they do wash themselves all over very often they have no bell to toll they to church but he that be the clerk or sexton have a deep base great voice and go to the top of the steeple and there roar out a warn for the people to come to their devotion no man do enter their church with his shoe on their talby or priest each one of they be allow a wife or wife if they will the layman may have captive woman but they must not lie with they in the nighttime for that belong to the wife by turn and if any wife be beguile of her turn she may complain for satisfaction to the magistrate he that have four wife must be a rich man a poor man be allow as many but his mean be too short to keep they therefore one or two must serve his turn the bride and bridegroom do never see each other before the wedding-night that they be go to bed where if he find she a maid all be well if otherwise he may turn she away and give she no part of the portion she bring he as concern their burial if any one do die they do wash the corpse all over and by reason the country be extreme hot they can keep they above ground with all speed they send for the friend or kindred of the party decease and carry the dead out of their town or city to a place appoint for that use for none be bury in their church or synagogue or within their town and there the talby say a short prayer and then the corpse be inter they have a custom to speak in praise of virtuous person depart to encourage and animate take with false weight or measure do lose all his ware in his house to the use of the poor and be a defame person and cruel whip their execution for life and death be that common the person adjudge to die have his throat cut by the executioner and these be part of the religion law and manner of the people of Morocco Fez and Sus and I do wish they be all inspire with holiness from God for I be sure they do surpass many christian in righteousness and just deal towards man in Africa there be many nation kingdom and province many part whereof be inhabit by christian as spaniard and portugal Aethiopia be a great tract of land in the south part of Africa it have many kingdom in it over who as chief ruler be Prester John he be emperor of Aethiopia or of the abassine he be a Christian and so be his people but withal they be all circumcise the
