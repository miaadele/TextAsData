The first Dialogue. Of Contracts.

NOmomathes.
I pray you Codicgnostes let me know whether any persons are by law prohibited to make any co^tract: deliuer your knowledge herein, and  let your companions speake to this point, and others that I shall propose, when and as far forth as shall seeme good vnto them.


Codicg.
The chiefe ground of contracts is co^sent,L. 1. ff. de pactis. and in c. Antig. Eo tit. de pact. and I. co^sens. ff. de action. and oblig. I. 1. ff. manda. Et I. ficut C. de actio. and obli. so that the persons which contract must be able to consent,1. The ground o^ contracts. and consent groweth of knowledge and from a mans free will, directly by sufficient vnderstanding for he that knoweth not what hee doth,2. T^e contracts of infants, persons d^stracted of their wits, and religious persons, whe her or how far fo^th they be good. cannot be said to bee wiiling to do a thing: as a man that is distract of his wits: or an infant that is within yeares of discretion,l. 5. ff. ad. leg. Falcid. l. 12. de leg. and the contract or couenant of such persons is not ratified by oath, which by law are forbidden to contract,l. non dub^^^ C. de legib. as Monkes and Friers and such like religious persons.

Indeed such persons are said in our law to be mortui mundo, dead to the world,16. q. vltim. c. fi. and they cannot liue without their Cloister no more then a fish without the water,16. q. 1. plac. and he can haue nothing priuate or proper to himselfe, and therefore the rule of the Canon-law is Monachus habe^s aliquid de proprio sepeliri debet in sterquilinio,De sta. mo. c. 2. and C. ad monaster. Ca. 1. and 2. de postula. 16. q. 1. monach. etc. religious. de procur. in cler. and he cannot be any mans aduocate in a cause, or any many proxie without the consent of his
 Abbot or Soueraign, and that must be to the vse and behoofe of his monasterie, and the like law is of Friers.Cle. dud. de sepul. and Cle. exiti de parad. de verbo fig


Nomomathes.
But is there no difference in the Lawe, betwixt the contracts of infants and the contracts of Monkes and Friers?


Codign.
Yes verie great:3. Monks are absolute^ prohibited by the Ciuill ^aw to make any contract: infants are disabled with a certaine qualification. For Monkes and Friers are prohibited by law to make any contract, so that as I haue abouesaid, their contract cannot be good, though it be confirmed by oath: But infan are not iure prohibiti, but inhabiles ex iuris dispositione, and therefore their contracts may by oath be established.Authent. sacramenta puberum cu^ tota sua materia. C. fi aduer. ve^dit and in corpore vnde sumitur.


Anglonomop.
As the former Lawes haue verie greatly disabled Monkes and religious persons, who are tyed to a certaine rule: so our Law hath verie much diminished their abilitie, as to their intermedling in secular matters. In a Scire facias brought by a Prior against a parson out of a recouerie had against his predecessor,4 That by the Common law Priors vnder the obedience of a Soueraign, and which were datife and remouable, cold not implead or be impleaded without the 1 soueraigne, vnlesse it were by special custom. it was held that the defendant should not be estopped by the admittance of his predecessour in the first action, to pleade in this Scire facias that the Priour was a Monke professed vnder the obedience etc. and was datife and remoueable,4. H. 6. 2. for though it haue beene held that a Priour perpetuall may prescribe to implead and to be impleaded without his Soueraigne, yet by common intent a Priour datife and remoueable at the will of the partie shall haue no action by such vsage, but if he will haue any plea he must shew some special matter,39. E. 3. 44. and it hath been said that the knights of
 S. Iohn of Ierusalem had their possessions seuerall,5. The same Law was of the knights of S Iohn of Ierusalem. yet they could not vse an Action without their Priour,32. H. 6. 5. and 31. and a Priour which was presentable, and had Couent and Common seale, could not before the dissolution of Abbeys and Priories charge his house in perpetuum, without the assent of the Patron and Ordinarie, neither could hee haue the Writte De aduocatione decimarum, nor a iuris vtrum,12. H. 4. Stath. tit. Charge. and a writ was abated being brought against a Prioresse, because the Prior of S. Iohns was commaunder of the house whereof shee was Prioresse, and because she was made Prioresse by him, and was vnder his obedience, and remoueable at his will, notwithstanding that shee had Couent and Common seale and had her possessions seuerall, and was wonte to Lease the lande for tearme of yeares,12. R. 2. Nonabilitie 4. and if a contract bee made with an Abbotte and his Monke, the Writ that hath beene grounded vpon this contract hath been brought against the Abbot onely,33. E. 3. Br^e 913. 2. H. 4. 21. and so hath a writ of Detinue beene brought being conceiued vpon a deliuery of goods made to the Monke to the vse of the Abbot,Ibidem. yet it hath beene thought that an action will lie against a Monke, if hee bee not in subiection to some soueraigne.14. H. 4. 37. But it hath been taken for a generall learning with vs that Monks and ^riers, and Canons professed and the like, could not grant any thing,14. H. 8. 16. 2. R. 3. 5. 32. H. 6. 31. neither could they be gra^tees of any thing,5 H 7. ^5. 19 H. 6. ^5. neither are they capable by way of deuise,Perk. ^it Deuis. sect 537 and the coue^t of an Abbey or Priorie can yeeld so little aduantage to the house in
 matter of purchase, that if in former times land had beene giuen to an Abbot and to his couent, this could not be good saue onely during the life of the Abbot for the want of this word (successors)11 H. 4. 84. per Curi. but touching the abilitie of infants in contractes and purchases the Lawe is diuers according to the diuersitie of cases, and if an infant do buy of any a coate or necessary vestment for certaine summe, or if he make a couenant for his meate paying 12. d. a weeke according to M. Paston his opinion, this couenant is void,6. The infant contract for his meate apparell, and necessaries is good, if he be of the age of fourteen years yea and if he make a bonde for it, the bonde likewise is void: but Markeham thinketh the contrarie if the infant that is so bound be of the age of fourteen yeares,21. H. 6. 31. 18. E. 4. 2. Perk Grau. 4. D. 5. diar. 2. fo. 113. and by M. Brookes opinion this is the better Law,Br. Labourers 30. and if an infant lease land for terme of yeares rendring a rent,7. That which an infant doth witho^t actual ^^crie may bee au ^ded by act^on without en^re or ^e^sure b^t tha which he do^h ^y actual liuery cannot be auoid^d without en^re or sei^^re. or doe sell a horse or any other thing he may chose to haue an action of Dette for the rent reserued vpon the Lease, or a Writte of Trespasse for the occupation of the Land, and so he may haue an action of trespasse for the occupation of a thing sold by him: and if an infant doe giue to one a horse without actuall deliuerie of the horse into his hands at the time of the gift and the donee taketh the Horse by reason of this gift, the infant may hauean Action of Trespasse against him,18. E. 4. 2. and if an infant make an obligation or lease in writing and inseale it, and deliuer it to a straunger as a scrowle to deliuer to him to whom it is made when the infant commeth to full age as his deede, and the straunger doth it, this is
 voide, because it is done by a commaundement, which is void,27. H. 7. 6. for the commandement or assent of an infant is void in law,11. Ass. pl. 14. so that a difference is to bee held, where an infant passeth away a thing to another by liuerie in facto and where not: for in the one case the gift or conueyance is voidable onely, in the other it is void to all intents. For if an infant make a lease for terme of yeares, or a lease by dures, if the lessee enter, the infant may haue an assise, but if the infant make a feoffement and deliuer seisin accordingly, hee shall haue no assise, for by the liuerie of seisin the feoffee had a possession at will at the least: but if ^ee make a letter of Attorney to deliuer seisin hee may haue an assise,9. H. 7. 24. and 2. Mar. 109. Dyer. Rug. but where any man doth a thing which is for the profite of an infant hee shall not bee punished as a trespasser, as if an infant commaunde one to repaire his houses and he doth it, this shall excuse him in an action of trespas.13. H. 7. 17. per Kebl.




Nomomathes,

You haue spoken sufficiently


Anglonomop.
of religious persons and infants, and of contracts made by them now I pray you shew vnto me whether the contract of the seruant shall bee accompted in law the contract of the master.^. whether th^ contract of the ^erua^^ sh^ll he ac^o^p^ed in law ^he contract of the masthr.


Anglonomop.
It hath beene held in our bookes that if a man haue a Bailife or Seruant who is knowne for his seruant,1 That ac^ending to the common Law the m^ster shal be bound by t^^ contract of a knowne seruant, i^ the thingi Merchanddsed do come to his vse: and he shall be bound by the co^tract of his factor ^hough the goods neuer come to his pessission if hee sende him to Fayres or Markets, to buy, to sell, or to doe other things markettable, his Master shall bee charged with the paiment, if the thing which
 is Merchandized doe come to his vse,2. R. 2. Dette 3. per Curi. and it hath beene likewise held that if a man sende his boy to the Market to buy thinges for him, and hee buyeth them, and bringeth them to him, and the vendor bringeth an action against the Maister, and auerreth that the goodes came to his vse, hee shall recouer against him in the action,4. E. 2. 16 r. and Pigot his opinion is that if one make another man his Factor to buy thinges for him, if hee buy Marchandize of any, the Maister shal be charged by this contract though the goods neuer came to his possession, because hee hath giuen vnto him such a power,8. E. 4. 1. and 9. Dutches de Suffolks case, per Pigot. But in the eighteenth yeare of King Edwarde the second a man was bound in a Recognisance to S. to pay at a certaine day, at which day the Reconusor came and profered the money in Court,3. The act of a mans Attorney or his generall receiuer doth not bind the master without special warrant. and because S. was in the Kings seruice there came one A. as his generall Attourney, and said that he was readie to receiue the money, and shewed forth to the Court a Warrant of Attourney, but because the Warrant of Attourney was that hee should be his Attourney In placitis and quaerelis ad lucrandum and perdendum, and the Recognisance was a thing alreadie adiudged and determined, and therefore could neither bee plea nor quarrell. therefore it was thought that his Warrant did not extend to receiue money,18. E. 2. Execut 245. so in an action of Dette brought vpon an Obligation the defendant did confesse the deed, and said that hee had paied the summe to one C. the generall receiuour of the plaintife,
 and hee had thereof an Acquittaunce which hee shewed foorth to the Court, but because hee had acknowledged the Obligation, and had shewed no Warrant of the plaintife, to paie the sayed money to C. so that the acquittance which was shewed, could not bee the deede of the plaintife, The Court awarded that the plaintife should recouer his debt and his dammages,5. E. 3. 63. but as to a mans seruant I take the Law to bee that his contract shall extend to his Maister, as well for preiudice as aduauntage, And therefore if a mans seruant sell to one certaine clothe, and warrant it to bee of a certaine length the Action will lye against the Maister onely, and not against the seruant, and if A. do assume to cure B. of a wound and hee sendeth his seruant to B. to lay medicines to the wound, whereby hee is hurte and empayred, B. cannot haue his Action vpon the case aginst the Seruaunt but against the Maister,11. 4. 6. Choke and Brian and of late-time the Lord North being Chauncellour of the Augmentation Courte, deliuered an Obligtion made to Queene Marie to his Seruaunt to deliuer ouer to the Clarke of the Augmentations, the Obligee and the Seruaunt did conspire and cancell the Obligation, the Maister was held in this case to bee chargeable.5. Mari. 16. 1. Dyer per Iustitiar^.

You haue satisfied me touching contracts made by a mans Seruaunt, now I pray you shew mee whether a contract made by the wife in the behalfe of the husband will binde1. Whether the wises contract made in the behalfe of the husb^nd, will bind the husband.
 the husband.


Anglonomoph.
In an action of debt brought against husband and wife, and another, vpon a contract made during the couerture,2 That by the common Law an action of ditte b ought vpon a co^ra made by the w^fe f^^ ^he b^ho ^e^uly against ^he husband without naming the wife. for the woman it was said, that a feme couert cannot make a contract, wherefore iudgement was demsunded of the action, and the husband and the third person pleaded the same matter to the Writ, and they could not be admitted to plead to the Writte, because the woman had pleaded to the action: but they pleaded the matter abouesaide in barre of the action, and weare receiued,34. E. 3. Briefe 923. and if the husband and the wife doe borrow money, this shall bee accompted the borrowing of the husband onely,33. E. 3. Briefe 913. and if a mans wife doe buy goods of one to the vse of hir husband, the wife is not in such case to be named in the Writ, that is to be brought hereupon.2. H. 4.21. per Markeham.


Codicgn.
By our Law,3 Th^t by the Ciui^ Law the husband is in no foyt to ^e ch^rged by the co^tract of his wife. no mans contract made in the behalfe of another, will bind the other, but such a persons contract who may bee bound for the other,ff. C. and ff. de pact. n congr. tit. t

You haue shewed vnto mee aboundantly, how contracts may stand good, and how they may be infringed by reason of the persons- which are parties or agents in the stipulation or contract and efficient causes thereof, by reason of their abilitie or disability possitiuely set down in Law, now I would haue you proceed to declare how by the materiall causes of contracts, they may stand or fall.





Codicgn.

A contract hath a materiall substance whereof it is made,1. How contracts may stand or fall by their materiall ca^ies, o^ the defect of them. as well as other things, and the materiall cause of a contract is the thing for which wee doe contract: for as in mechanicall and artificiall things there is required some apt matter,D. L. adeo @. cum quid. whereof a thing may be wrought, so in contracts and couenants as well these which are determinable by the Law of Nations, as these which are sentenced by the Ciuil Law and other Laws, to the end they may be well perfited and concluded, some materiall cause is requisite.ff. de verb. oblig. l. intrr Stipulantur @. sacramentur de praescriq^ verb. l. insula.




Nomum.

Why, are any contracts ordered by the Law of Nations?1 Some contracts a co^d^red by the law of nations.


Codicgn.
Yea, for by that Law an Embassador may be impleaded for such contracts as he maketh during the time of his Embassage,2. An Embassador may acc rding to the Ciuill Law bee impleaded by the Law of nations for a co^tra^ made whilst he is Embassador. left (as Iulianus saith) hee presume to take other mens goods with him into his owne countrey,L. 25 D. de iud. or (as Paulus reasoneth plainely and pithily) least men fearing to contract with them, if they be not in this regard subiect to Law, they bee excluded from all commerce and entercourse of bargain:L. 24. de min. l. 11. ad Vell l. 12. de and this Law is supported by that excelle^t rule of equitie, that no man ought to growe richer by another mans losse, and if one that is no Embassador doe contract with one, and after bee made an Embassador, yet he is now chargeable with the contract. Likewise an action will lye against an Embassador by the Law of Nations if hee couenant to performe a thing when hee is Embassador, if it so fall out that the charge and credit of Embassage be committed vnto him,L. 3. D. de lega. African. L. 2. p. 1. de iud.



Nomom.
I am verie desirous to know Codicgnostes  whether contracts made with Pyrats and with robbers by the high way are auaileable and of force by the Ciuill law, or the law of Nations:1. whether co^tra^cts made with Pyrats or robbers in the highway be good in Law


Codign.
I doe not thinke that pyrats and robbers are to haue aduantage by any Law in matter of contract, because they haue cast aside all care of humane societie, and seeke to reduce the world as much as lieth in their power, to the pristinate wildenes and sauagenesse of nature, when men did liue like beasts, and as Lucretius saithLucret. li. 5.,
Quod praedae obtulerat fortuna cuique, ferehatSp^nte sua sibi quisque valere and viuere doctos. And such persons may not inioy the benefite of Law to which they are enemies,Paul. l. 63. ad leg. Falc. To such men which haue withdrawne themselues from the communion and societie of men,2 that Pyrats and robbers are not to haue aduantage of law in matters of contract. and (asFlor. lib. 3. Florus saith (haue brooken the league of mankind, why should the Law of Nations, which is nothing else but the communion and league of Nations, extend any fauour. Pyrats (as Plinie sayth) are enemies to all men liuingPlin lib. 2. cap. 49. and therefore Cicero auoucheth, that if thou doest not bring to robbers of Pyrates, the raunsome which thou hast promised for thy life, there is neither offence nor fraudulent dealing in thee, no though thou hast promised with an oathCicer. pro leg. Manil. and 3. de offic.. Therefore some doe wonder that D. Hotoman dare affirmeHotom. 7. Illust. question, that the Law of Nations doeth extend to fugitiues and robbers, and his chiefe reason is,3 that D. Hotoman erreth g^eatly^i maintayning that Pyrats and robbers may lawfully con- because there is no Lawe which doth interdict and forbid to couenant or contract with them, and such things
 in his opinion, as are not verbally forbidden, are implicatiuely permitted. This reason is of no validitie; for it may be implicatiuely forbidden, and in that they may be enemies to all men, and do spare no man, they ought not to protect themselues by the Law of Nations, which is the Law of all men: The questio^ is not what may be done vnto them, or how many men hath dealt with them; but how by the rule of equitie and soundnesse of reason they ought to be dealt with. For to dispute of Law is to dispute of a publike bo^d whereby wee are bound and obliged, but we are not bound to such Lawlesse, disorderly, and incorrigible persons, by anie common respect of duetie.




Nomo.

I will not trouble you farther Codicgn. with more ample discourse of this mater, but wil rest well apaid with that which you haue already spoken. Now I long to hear somwhat of Aoglon. touching the materiall causes of contracts.


Anglonomo.
A consideration which is the proper materiall cause of a contract,1 That by the common ^aw a confideratio^ is the proper materiall ^a^se of a contract, and that it may be expressed or implied. may in the concluding of bargains be either exprest, or implide: x prest, as if I buy a Horse of you for xx. s. you may keepe the Horse till I haue paid you the money,10. E 4.10. and M. Choke is of opinion that if you buy of one a horse in Smithfield for a certain summe of money, and doe not pay him the mony presently, hee may sell the horse to anie other in continent, and you cannot haue any remedies a^ainst him; for otherwise hee might bee compeled to keepe his horse for euer against his will17. E. 4.1. per Choke.
 For it is implyed in the bargaine that the vendee must pay the money incontinent, otherwise hee cannot haue the thing solde, but if the payment bee respited vnto a certaine day vpon the contract, this is good enough, so that the money be payed within the time perfixed,21. H. 7. 6 and 28. H. 8.2 That a contract is not good without money paid in hand o^ a certaine day of payment limited. it is positiuely set downe for Law that a contracte is not good without present payment vnlesse a certain day of payment bee limitted, so that the one of them may haue an action of debt for the money, the other a Writ of Detinue for the wares:28. H. 8. 3 Dyer. An implied consideration is when the Law it selfe doth intend and inforce a consideration, and therefore the Hoste of a common Inne may deteine a mans horse if he will not pay him for his horse meat: And so if a Tayler make a gowne for any man, he may deteine the gowne till he be payed for his labour.5. E. 4. 2.


Nomomat.
Doth not the defect of forme in a eontract frustrate and defeate the contract?  


Codicgn.
Yes:1 wh ther the defect of form doe destroy the contract. for as the substantiall forme in materiall things is necessarie to the essence and constitution of such thing:ff. ad extrib. l. iulian. s. and l. falfi. l. si. is qui. ^. quidem. so in contracts a certaine solemnitie and concurrence of circumstances is required for the perfiting of them,2 Tha^ sol^mpnitie and co^cur e^ce if cir u^sta^ces is req^i^ed in c n^ract^ by the Ciuill law. as their naturall and proper forme:ff. de verb. obligatur l. sciend and l. continuus in princip. Eo. l @. si quis ita. q and without such ceremoniousnesse the contract is of no force^.


Anglonomo.
Our law likewise requireth forme eyther in pronouncing the wordes of the contract, or else in obseruing som other circumstances belonging to the contract. For the first, if a man promise to another xx. li. with his daughter
 in marriage, if he marrie the daughter and the money be not payd he shal not haue anie action of debt, or action vpon the case at the Common Law,3. That matrimoniall Contracts, if there be no assumpsit in them, are to be decided by the Ecclesiasticall Law: if there be an assumpsit, by the common law. but he must sue for this money in the Spirituall Court.Fitz nat. br^ 44. 2. 14. E. 4. 6. Reg. 46. and 48. 15 H. 3. Prohibition 22. 16. H. 3. Prohi. 24. For here is no good forme of co^tract: and (as Master Bracton saith) Matrimonium est principale, and eiusdem iuris, id est inrisdictionis esse debet accessorium.Bracton lib. 5. cap. 16. And therfore if a man by reason of Matrimonie or Testament doe acknowledge in a Spirituall Court that hee ought to pay to one a hundreth markes, or some other summe at a certaine day, if the money be not paied at the day accordingly, he may bee sued for this money in the Spiritual Court, and no prohibition lyeth,Fitz. nat. br^. 41. b. but if in the former case he had promised one x. li. if he would marrie his daughter, if he doe marrie his daughter and the other will not pay the money he may not sue him in the Spirituall Court for this money, but at the Common Law,Fitz. nat. br^ 44. a. and 22. Ass. pla. 70. per Tho. and 1. H. 3. Prohibit. 22. for now it goeth in forme of contract, as for the other matter where forme is required in obseruing some other circumstance in the contract, that may appeare by this case: If a felon sel a Horse without couin in a Market ouert, this doth alter the property, and the verie proprietarie cannot haue restitutio^ of the horse notwithstanding the Statute of 21. H. 8. cap. 11. but if he had sold him out of a Market ouert, the propertie had not bin altered.33. H. 6. 5. 18. E 4. 24. 7. H. 7. 12. Crompt. Iust. de Peace 172.

I will trouble you no further in this matter, but will proceed to enquire somewhat touching Gifts and Graunts.




The second Dialogue of Gifts and Graunts.

NOmomathes.
In handeling the learning  of Gifts and Graunts,1. What things may be giuen or granted. I thinke it most fit in the first place to bee enquired what things may be giuen or graunted: wherefore first I pray you satisfie me in this.


Codicgn.
A man may giue all such things as an other may receiue:l. in aedibus @. si. ff. Eo. tit. for dare and accipere sunt correlatiua:2 That all things that li^ in commerce and may be rece ued may be giuen. and all such things may bee receiued which lie in commerce.


Nomom.
Then things consecrated and ecclesiastical may not be ^liened, because they lie not in contract.


Codicgn.
Things ecclesiasticall though they be not consecrate,3 That things ecclesiastic^ll tho^gh they be not consecrate cannot regularly be g^anted. cannot regularly be giuen or grantedCap. 2. de donation. and Eod. tit. de re. ecclesi. non alien. in antiquis 6. and Cle. and in c. sine except. cap. si quisquis 12. q. 2. and in l.

Anglonomo.
In our Law a Writ of Contra formam alienationis lieth where a man gaue lands or tenements to an Abbot or house of Religion before the Statute of Quia emptores terrarum, to hold of him in frankalmoigne, and after the Abbot with the Couent did alien the same land in fee to another;4 That if an Abbot alien land^ giuen in franke almogne to his house, the donor might haue a Writ of Contra forma^ collationis. now hee that gaue this lande or his heire may sue this Writte of Contra formam collationis against the Abbot or his successor, but not against the tenant of the land, but

Nomom.

Let me know I pray you how many kinds of Gifts there be.


Aoglonomoph.
1 The diuerse kinds of Gifts, som being free some compensatorie.They be of diuerse sorts: some are called free Gifts, which proceede meerely of a mans good will and beneuolence: others may be called Compensatorie, because they are giuen for some cause or consideration: Gifts or gra s of the first kind are such as I shall nowe recite out of our bookes. Frst, the Queene may graunt to one lande ex mero motu,2 What is wrought by the Queenes grant ex me^o motu. and though her Highnesse doe rehearse some consideration in the patent of her graunt which is not true, as if the consideration bee, that whereas the grauntee hath done her Maiestie good seruice on the Sea, or beyond the Sea, or in her Maiesties warres, or in some other busines: though the consideration be meerely supposed and not true, and therefore no good consideration in Law, yet the words ex mero motu doe make the grant good26. H 8. 1. per Fitz., and whereas the Queene ex certa scientia, and mero motu doth confirme a graunt, supposing that a graunt was made before, where in truth there was no such
 thing, it is held that her highnes shall be concluded to say, that no such grant was made: otherwise it had beene if this word (informamur) had bin vsed in reciting the grant.9. H. 7. 2. For if her highnesse grant anie thing vpon the false suggestion of the partie, this graunt is voide,3 What is wrought by her Maiesties grant by words of Informamur. because she is deceiued in her graunt,11. E. 4. 1. per Littletur. and wee haue a rule: Si suggestio non sit vera, literae patentes su^t vacuae.3. H. 7. 6. For when the graunt is made vpon the suggestion of the partie, the words of the graunt shall bee taken strictly, but when it is ex mero motu it must be construed and interpreted according to the Kings intent, and as fauorably for the grauntee as reason will permit21. E. 4. 25. Abbe de Walthams case per Browne and Genney., and if a common person doe without consideration giue to I. S. his his goods (indefinitly) al his goods do passe, and if a common person doe by deede enrolled enfeoffe the Queene of his lands without any consideration, the Queene shall be seised to her own vse, as hauing such prerogatiue in her person, that shee shall not bee seised to the vse of anie other.28.

 the land, and that hee held in Capite, and I. was founde to bee his heire and of full age: yet it was helde that the heire should not be receiued to auerre the consideration false against the acknowledgement of his ancestor:1. Eliz. 169. Dy. Wilk. case. and so it hath beene helde in Villiers his case, that where money is the consideration expressed another consideratio^ shal not be auerred,5 That a consideration may be auerred which is not repugnant to the vse expressed. neither shal a Causa matrimonij praelocuti be auerred where another consideration is expressed, but where no consideration is expressed, there a consideration may be auerred: or where the consideration auerred is not repugnant to the consideration expressed in the deed.4.

As to the point of consideration we  shall better perceiue the strength and properties therof,1 In what case^ graunt^ shal be taken most beneficially for the grauntee. when we enter into discourse of bargains and sales, now let mee know in what cases, and how farre forth graunts shall bee taken most beneficially for the grauntee.


Anglonomoph.
When a graunt is non-certaine,2 That a grant non-certaine must be taken m^st strongly agai^st the grauntor. it must be taken most strongly against the grauntor; for if a man graunt an annuitie out of certaine lande, and hee hath no lande at the time of the graunt, yet the grant shal charge his person9. H. 6. 12. per Babingtur., and if a deede of graunt be good in parcell, and for parcell not,3 That a grant may be good in p^rt, and for parcell not. that which is for the aduantage of the grauntee shal be taken to be good, as if a man graunt vnto me an annuitie, prouiso that it shall not charge his person, the prouiso is voide, and the graunt is good20. E. 4. 8. per Towns. 14. H. 4. 30. per Hank., And if an annuitie be graunted pro consilio impendendo, though the grauntee be well skilled in diuers sciences or faculties, yet counsell shalbe giuen in that faculty only, which was intended at the time of the graunt41. E. 3. 6. Annuitie 19., But in some cases the graunt must be construed according to a reasonable and indifferent intendment, as if a man make a lease of a house, so that the lessee may make his profite of the houses within it, the lessee cannot in this case take downe or demolish the houses, nor make waste in them, for the intent was not so,17. E. 3. 17. but if the King graunt to me visum franciplegij in omnibus terris meis, and feodis,
 I cannot haue this in my landes and tenements,4 How the Queens grants and licen^ies shall be construed and interpreted. which I shall afterwards purchase,38. H. 6.10. But if the king graunt to a man that he and his heires shall bee quit of taxe for their landes which they haue, this is a good graunt though there bee no taxe due at the time of the graunt,Ibid. And so is the Law of Tenths and Fifteenes19. H. 6. 62. 21. H. 6. 43. 21. E. 4. 45., and he to whom the King graunteth a licence may not varie from the proper sense and the significancy of the words.18 E 2. Fines 124. And if the king before the dissolution of Monasteries had licenced an Abbot and his Couent to make a feoffement, if the Abbot onely had made it the feoffement had beene voide,21. H. 7. 8. And 3. Ed. 3. the King licenced one to leuie a fine of the mannour of Dale, to the intent to maintayne two Chaplaines, and hee woulde haue leuied the fine omitting the Chaplaines, but was not suffered,3. E. 3. 5. and 3. Edward 3. the licence was to leuie a Fine of the Mannour of Dale, and hee woulde haue leuied the Fine with a foreprise or exception of certaine acres, parcell of the Mannour, rendring rent, but was not admitted to it, because it coulde not stande with the licence, which was that all the Mannour should bee charged with the rent,30. E. 3. 17. So if the Queene licence one to make a Feoffement by deede, hee cannot make i^ without deede,21. H. 7 8. per Frowike. and this Lawe holdeth likewise in a common persons case, for if hee that hath a Warrant of Attourney to deliuer seisin absolutely, doe deliuer seisin vpon condition, this is a disseisin to the feoffour12. Ass. pl. 24., And a graunt is not to bee fauoured contrarie
 to the euident and perspicuous sense of the words.3 That a grant is not to be fauored contrary to the manifest sense of the word. For if a man grant to another a loade of wood to take in his soyle euery yeare, and the grauntee surceaseth the two first yeares, and the third yeare hee taketh three loades, hee is a wronge doer for two of them: so if a man graunt to another a common for three beasts yearely, and hee taketh nothing the two first yeares, hee shall not haue common for three beastes the third yeare.27. H. 6. 10.

Now resolue mee whether a graunt  that is not good at the first may bee made good by matter ex post facto.


Anglonomop.
In no sorte:1 That by the co^mon law a grant that is not good at the first may not be made good by matter ex post fact^, neither by the Ciuil Law. for if there bee Lorde and three ioyntenaunts, and the Lorde graunteth the seruices of one of them to a straunger, this is a voyde graunt though the same tenaunt doe attourne, and suruiue his compaignions. For no attournement can make an euill graunt to bee good,5. E. 3. 34. and if a man lease lande to the husbande and wife during their liues, and after graunteth the reuersion of the
 land which the husband holdeth for tearme of life, and then attournement is had, the graunt is voide, and the attournement also.13. E. 3. Bro. Iointen. 63. And if a man be bound to a feme sole, and a straunger releaseth to the obligour, and after marrieth the feme, yet the release is not good.l. 15. E. 3. Feoffement. 63. So it is if in auncient time a Monke, Fryer, or Cannon professed, which was no Soueraigne of an house, had graunted to one an annuitie, this was a voyd graunt, though he had beene after dereigned, or made Soueraigne of the same house, or some other2.

Let me aske you this question Anglonomoph.1 Whether a tenant at will may graunt ouer his estate. whether may a tenant at will graunt ouer his estate or no, especially if he in the reuersion doe after agree to it.


Anglonomo.
2 That the estate of the tenant at will is in maner no estate.I think not: for it is not properly an estate because it wanteth certaintie,27. H. 6. 3. but if my tenant at will be outed by a straunger, hee may reenter without my commandement: for the entre of a stranger doth not determine my wil,11. E. 43: and another reason why he cannot graunt his estate, is because his estate dependeth as well vpon his owne will, as the will of the lessor, and if he lease ouer the land, his will as to that intent is determined, and by consequent his estate,22. E. 4. 5. per Brian. and his estate is such a non-estate in the eye of Law, that he cannot haue ayd of his lessor,12. E. 4. 5. and if the heire
 accept a rent reserued vpon a lease at will made by his father, this cannot make the lease good, because it was voide before, no more then his acceptance of a rent reserued vpon a lease for yeres which is determined by reentrie, can make that lease good.14. H. 8. 11.

Let me heare of you some special kinds and cases of bargaine and sale out of your Law,6 What things are forbidden to bee sold by the common Law. and some good diuersities, whereby me thinkes the knowledge and vnderstanding are greatly  enlightned and increased.


Codign.
If a man bargaine and sell lands or goods to one vpon condition,1 Where a thing was not fold at the first and where it was sold, but the sale is defeasible vpon condition. that if the whole price or that which remaineth to bee paied bee not payed or satisfied at such a day, then the thinge whereof the price is agreed vppon betwixt them shall bee vnbought: nowe if the money bee not payed at the day, the thinge whereof the communication was, in the intendement of Lawe was not solde at the first:l. 1. ff. de leg. Comm. and li. qui ea lege C. cod. But if it had beene sayde, that if the money had not beene paied at the day, then the thinge solde shoulde reuerte to the vendour, heere there had beene a perfitte bargaine and sale, but resolubilis sub conditione, defeasible vpon the condition not perfourmed,l. 1. ff. de leg. commissor. and in all conditions of bargaine and sale this is done that either an imperfitte sale is perfitted, or a perfitte sale is defeated. For when communication is had about the buying of a thing, and the price is agreed vpon, and the bargaine concluded, nowe if the vendour doe at the time of the bargaine and sale adde such a condition, that if any other man within a moneth or fifteene dayes next after ensuinge, will giue more
 money for the thing solde, that then the bargaine and sale shall bee voyde:L. 2. 1. reespre ff. de in diem adicc. now the bargaine and sale is perfite,2 A difference betwixt a perfite sale, and a sale to be perfited vpon a condition performed. but it is defeasible vpon a condition: but if in the same case the price bee agreed vpon, so that no person doe within a moneth or fifteene dayes giue more for it, now this sale is to be perfited vpon a co^dition performed,d. l. 2. respon. and there is a great difference betwixt these two bargaines and sales, For in the first case the buyer doth become owner of the thing Sed retractabiliter.l 1. @. sed and Marcellus ff. de addicti. in diem.

You haue put good diuersities and wee haue manie cases suteable vnto them in our Law, which I will not omit. If a man graunt to one the keeping of his Parke, vpon condition that if the grauntee doe not well keepe his Deere within the Parke, the graunt shall bee helde as no graunt: and after the grantee killeth some of the Deere,3 That a prouiso though i^ be placed amongst couenants, may defeat a bargaine and sale. the grauntor may bring an action of trespasse for the breaking of his Parke, and for the killing of his Deere,2. R. 2. Barre 237. and a prouiso in an Indenture of couenants though it bee placed amongst couenants, yet it shall bee of force in some case wholly to defeate and dissolue the bargaine and sale; as if a man bargaine and sell a mannor with
 the Aduowson in fee, habendum to the vse of the bargainee and his heires, in such manner as in the Indenture of couenants is agreed, and he couenanteth to suffer a recouerie to the vse expressed in the Indenture, re^dring a rent to the bargainor and his heires with a distresse for the same, and a nomine paenae, and further pro vlteriore securitate, it is concluded that the bargainor should leuie a fine to the bargainee with a re^dring of the rent to the bargainor, prouiso that the bargainee shal regra^t the Aduowson for life to the bargainor, and if it be couenanted farther that all estates afterward to be made shall be to the said vses, now if a recouerie be suffered, and a fine leuyed, but varying from the Indenture of couenants, and the bargainee dieth before the regraunt of the aduowson, the prouiso in this case is a condition, and for the breach of the condition the bargainor may enter14. Eliz. 311.

For if a Praecipe quod reddat, had been brought against the husband and the wife after liuerie, and the husband had disagreed pending the Writ, the writ shall abate, yet the taking of the profites is iustifiable: for the feoffement made to the woman is good till the husband disagreePer Br.

In these cases, which you haue now put, our Lawe (as I take it) differeth verie little, or nothing from yours: for whereas you say,5 That bargains and sales, matters in writing and obligatorie, may be auoyded by al^eaging that they were made or done per menace or by du^esse. that a bargain or sale enforced by terror may bee auoyded: in our Lawe euen matters in writing and obligatorie may be for the same cause defeated and frustrated: and if a man seised of an acre of land doe giue it in taile by deed, and maketh a letter of Attourny to deliuer seisin, and all this is done by duresse of imprisonment, and liuerie of seisin is made, this is a disseisin to the donor, and the deed of gift and liuerie may by Law be auoided41.

 if I wil not grant to him an annuitie of xx. s. and for doubt of death I graunt it vnto him, this graunt is voidable,11. R. 2. Duresse 13. But if a man grant an annuitie to another by threatning him that he will cary away his goods, wherupon he graunteth vnto him the annuitie, this gra^t is not voidable by reason of such menacing, because he may haue an actio^ to recouer the goods if they be take^ away,7.

If a man sell vnto one certain cloth and warrant it to be of such a length, and it is not of that length, he which buyes the cloth may haue an action of disceit against him by vertue of the warranty: but if the warranty be made at some other time after the bargaine, he may not haue a writ of disceite,Fitzh. natur br^ 98.

 it be with warranty,7 That the warranting of a thing which is euident to the sense is no cause to bring a Writ of disceit by the Common law. and the warra^ting of a thing to be blacke which is blew, where the colour is euident to sense is no cause of bringing a writ of disceit, but is meerly void: otherwise it is if the buyer be blind, or the thing that is bought be abse^t11.

Suppose a man graunt vnto mee his Mare for a certaine time, I may during the time vse the Mare at my pleasure, but I may not lend her or set her ouer to some other to vse, neyther can I haue the fole which commeth of her, for by the graunt I may claime vsum onely, but not vsum fructum: and so he to whom the vse of a mans ground is graunted may take the profits of the ground to his owne vse, but may not sell them to othersGazatup. in vocabular. verbo vti and frui..

I would gladly knowe when a man  selleth his land in which there is treasure hidde,1 When a man selleth land in which treasure is hid and the vendor knowe h not of it, whether shall the ven^ee haue the treasure?2 How this word (Treasure) is taken in the Ciuill law. whether the vendee shall haue the treasure, because the vendor knew not of it at the time of the sale.


Codign.
It may bee you take the word Treasure generally, not properly and as it is vsed strictly in our Law; for if a man do hide anie thing in the ground for gaine, or through feare, or to keep it more safely, within time of memorie this may not properly haue the name of treasurel. nunquam D de acquirrer. domin., for a treasure properly is, when money or things of good value haue lyen from time out of minde hidden in the ground, so that no man now hath propertie in itd. l. nunqua^..3 That by the Ci^ill law money and other things necessarie to the common vse of this l^^e are f^rbidden to be hidden and buried in the ground. It hath been forbidden by many lawes that money may not be buriedl. 4. D. ad leg. Iul. pecul., and these Lawes haue reason for them,Aristot.

Plato had such a scrupulous, or rather such a superstitious conscience, that he made by his lawes treasures to be immobiles, and Dijs inferis sacros, and his precept is straunge in this case. Quae minime deposuisti, ne tollito.Plat. lib. 11. de legi. Adrianus. Caesar made a Law (as Spartianus reporteth) that if any man had found treasure in his owne ground, himselfe should haue it: if in another mans, he should giue the halfe to the owner of the soile: if in a publique place, hee should diuide it equally with the treasurie. This Law was abrogated by other Lawes following,5.

The fourth Dyalogue of Seignories and Seruices.

NOmomathes.
Because things are better and more certainly known by the definition  of them, therefore I pray you let me first haue of you some definition or description of a Seignorie.


Codicgn.
A Seignorie, which we call feodum, may be thus described.1 The discription of a seignorie by the Ciuill law. A bountifull granting of land for doing homage or some other speciall seruice.Glo. in vsi. feu. tit. quib. mod. feod. acquir. in princip. c. vnico @ in primis and tit. in quib. caus. feud. amit. and de feud. dat: mi. valuas. ca. vnico. and melius tit. de feud. dat: in vicem leg: co^missor: reprob: cap: vnic:


Anglonomoph.
A seignory with vs,2. Likewise by the Common law. is nothing else but a relation of delitie betwixt the tenaunt and the Lord.


Canonolog.
In our Canon law it is shortly defined:3. By the Canon law. The granting of land for homage.C. ex diligenti. de simo^.


Nomomath.
Shew me I pray you how homage and other seruices had their first existence and  beginning, but first shew me what homage is.


Anglonomoph.
Homage is thus performed. The tenant that is to do homage,1. What homage is, and how it is to be performed by the Common law. must haue his head discouered, and his Lord sitting, he must kneele before him vpon both his knees, and shall holde forth both his hands betweene the hands of his Lord, and shall say as followeth. I become your man from this time forward of life and member, and earthly honour, and to you shall be faithfull and loyall, and shall beare vnto you faith for the tenements, which I claime to hold of you sauing the faith which I beare to our Lord the King: which being done the
 Lord sitting shall kisse him.Litt. li. 2. c. 1.


Nomom.
Hath this Ceremony beene auncient?


Codicgn.
2. That Homage hath bin practised in ancient ^ime.The kneeling and giuing of a kisse at the doing of such seruice is very auncient: for Tiridates the King of Armenia did kneele down before Nero the Emperor, whom Nero lifted vp and gaue him a kisse.Tranquil. in Neron. And long before his time, Alexander the great did imbrace, and with a kisse greeted such as made the like potestation of obedience and loyaltie vnto him,Plutarch. in Alexand. and long before that as it seemeth it was vsed in Iudaea, for vpon these words of the PsalmPsalm. 2. r. 12. (kisse the sonne) our English glosse addeth by way of interpretation (in signe of homage) and Tremellius and Iunius (in signe of fealty:) sithence these times this respectiue humiliation hath spred it selfe into other countries and territories: for the Duke of Gelderland did conceiue an oath in these words to Charles King of France: Ego deuenio vassallus ligeus Caroli regis Francorum, pro ratione quinquaginta millium scutorum auri ante festum diui Rhemigij mihi soluendorum, etc.Bodin. lib. 1. de repub. c. 9.




Nomom.

I desire greatly to knowe the originall and first blossoming of other seignories.


Anglonomoph.
1. What a Manor is, and wherof it consisteth.The most common seignorie of accompt which wee haue in our Law, is a seignorie by reason of a Manor, which may be thus defined. A manor is an inheritance of auncient continuance co^sisting of demesnes and seruices, perquisites, casualties, things appendant and regardant, customes, liberties, etc.



Nomoma.
What? do so many things concurre to make a manor: will not demesnes and seruices serue?


Anglono.
Yes, demesnes and seruices will suffice as materiall causes to make a Manor,26. H. 8. 4. but it is a naked manor which hath nothing else.


Nomom.
I would gladly heare somewhat of the commencement and first creation of a Mannor.


Anglonomo.
M. Parkins doth very well and originally describe it in this maner.2. The original of a Manor. The originall of a Manor was when the K. did giue a thousand acres of land, or a greater or lesse parcell to one of his subiects and his heires, to hold of him and his heires, and the donee edifieth a house vpon his land, as his mansion place and of 20. acres. or lesse, or greater parcell, he doth infeoffe a stranger before the Statute of Quia empto. terrar. to hold of him and of his heires as of the same house by the plowing of 10. acres of arable land parcel of that which remaineth in his own possession, and infeoffeth another of another parcell to hold of him by carying ordure to his arable land, and infeoffeth a third man of a third parcell to goe with him in the warre against the Scots, and so by continuance of time (saith he) a Manor is made.Park. Reseruat. fol. 128. Sect. 670. Yet by his fauour somewhat els goeth to the making of a Manor: namely, suite of Court at his house or mansion place,33. H. 8 Br. Comprise. 31. Mannor 5. and this suite must bee the suite of more freeholders then one (so that some doubt may be made of M. Kitchins assersion, when he saith, that in some Manors there be no tenants but copiholders, and yet in such Manors be Court baronsKitch. Court Leet and Baron tit. Manerium. fol. 4.) for if all the
 freeholds do escheat vnto the lord beside one, or if he purchase al but one the manor is extinct, for it cannot be a^manor vnles there be a court baron belonging to it: and a Court baron must be held before suitors, and not before one suitor, therfore one freehold cannot make a manor.Br. Ca. Sect. 210. and 23. H. 8. Br. Court baro^ 22. in fi. and 33. H. 8. Suit. 17.




Nomom.

You haue well declared vnto me the beginnings of seignories and manors: but haue there bin no laws made for the strengthning and preseruing of them: for me thinks they be good meanes to increase and support, the wealth, puissance, and florishing estate of the realme.


Anglono.
Yes, our law in this case hath not either slu^bred or winked. For in the ancient statute of Magna Charta it is prouided that Nullus liber homo det de caetero amplius de terra sua,Statutes made for the pre^eruation of seignories and manors. vel vedat de caetero, qua^ vt de residuo terrae suae possit sufficientur fieri domino feodi seruitiu^ ei debitu^ quod pertinet ad feodu^ illud,Magn^ charta c 13. which statute (as M. Sta^ford auoucheth,) is but a co^firmation of the co^mon law: and he (a most diligent and exquisite searcher of the reasons of law, so that I may boldly speake of him, that which I shal not say impudently and vntruly, Foelix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas) sifteth out the reason of this Law. For (saith he) if one that held by Knights seruice migh haue bin suffered to haue aliened the greatest part of his land, he would haue aliened the same peraduenture to holde of him but in Socage, or by some small rent, and then hauing so little a liuelod left to himselfe, how had hee been able to haue done the seruice of a Knight or man of warre, or what should his Lord haue had in warde
 to haue found one to haue performed the seruice? surely little or nothing.Stamf. praerog. c. 7. tit. Alienati: sans licence. But it seemeth doubtfull notwithstanding the Statute of Magna Chart. whether the tenaunt might alien his whole tenancie or not, whereupon the Statute of Quia emptores terrarum was made, which permitted euery freeman to sell his lands or tenements, or any part therof at his pleasure to hold of the chief Lord by the same seruice, that the feoffer held, prouided alwaies that by any such sale, there come no lands to mortmain. This Statute (as M. Stamford noteth) remedieth the mischiefe, which was before found in the wardship, but not the other mischiefe touching the defence of the Realme, for when one mans liuing is dismembred, neuer a one of the feoffees nor the feoffor is able to doe the seruice of a Warrior for want of liuelode, there being so little quantity of land in euery of their hands, yea much more vnable sithence this statute is the feoffer then before, for before when he gaue it to hold of himselfe, he reserued somewhat in lieu of the land which went from him, whereas now he can reserue nothing of common right.Stamf. ibid. And the land which he retaineth in his owne hands may perhaps be of small value.


Nomom.
What is the most generall and most  common seruice of all?


Anglonomoph.
Fealtie,1. Fealtie is the most generall seruice in the Common law. 2. and in the Ciuill law. for that is incident to euery tenure, vnles it be tenure in frankalmoign.Littlet. lib. 2 c. 3. Sect. 13. etc. 5. Sect. 22.


Codicgn.
So it is with vs: for fealtie which of vs is called fidelitas, is due to euery Lord to
 whom any seruice is to be performed: and euerie tena^t ought to do such seruice,3. That by the Ciuill law the Common law and the Canon law, a religious man ought to do fealtie. yea though he be a religious man and professed vnder rule.ca. vnico tit: de natura feudi. Et tit. qualiter vassall. iur. deb fideli: dom^i: Et in ca. vnico. tit quib. mod: feud: amittatur. Et in quib. causis feudum amitt. and tit. quae fuit pri. causa benef. amit.

Anglonomo.

Nomoma.

Shew me I pray you some speciall kinds of these seruices, that I may know them more fully, and more distinctly.


Codicgn.
1. The diuerse kindes of seruices in the ciuill Law, and their definitions.Seruices are diuersified according to the qualities of the persons to whom they are to be done: if it bee to be done to an Emperour, it is to be tearmed an Imperiall seruice: if to a King, a regall seruice,Cap. 1. de feud: march: and ducat: and in ca. 1. quis dicat. dux, comes, marchio. if to Religious persons Ecclesiasticall: if to Lay-men, secular,Tit. de his qui feud. dar. pos. and tit. Episcop. vel Abbar. but when it is to bee done to a lesser estate then to an Emperour or King, as to a Duke, Marquesse, or Earle, then it is called feudum honoratum; sometime land is giuen by inferior persons and meaner men without expressing any seruice, and then the Law intendeth that fealty only is to be done, and this is called Francu^ or Liberu^,Ca. 1. de no. form: fidel: sometime it is giuen with reseruation of speciall seruice and that is feudu^ non nobile,Ca. fi de capilan: qui eur: vendid. sometime it is giuen in perpetuu^ and sometime but for tearme of life, and then it is called perpetuum vel temporaleDe feud: march: in prin. de alien. feud. in fine, and de feud: guard: and castald.. But though by the oath of fealtie the vassalle be bound to serue
 his Lord in warre, yet this is limited to such case where the warre is not notoriously vniust or vnlawfull: for if it be otherwise, though hee doe him no seruice in warre, yet he shall not forfeit his tenement,In cap: Dn^o guerra^ in prin. in tit. hic fini. lex deinde etc. neither is he bound to do his seruice to his Lord if his Lord be excommunicate, or banished, vntill hee haue obtained absolution or a recalling from banishment:D. cap. Dn^o guerra^ in fin. but in a iust warre, the vassalle is bound to helpe his Lorde against euerie other person, who is not the Lord of the vassall, yea euen against his father, brother, or sonne.


Anglonomoph.
Seruices in our Law are of diuers sorts:2. The diuerse kinds of seruices in the co^mon law and their definitio^s some being more noble and some lesse noble: of those which are more noble, some belong to the king and some both to the king and to subiects: of those that belong to the king, some be domestical only, as Petite Sergeancy: some bellicall onely as Knights seruice: in Capite some both domesticall and bellicall, as grand sergeancy, and some of the more noble seruices belong vnto subiects as well as to the king, as knights seruice and homage: those which be lesse noble may be diuided into two branches: for either they are ingenuous, or seruile: the ingenuous are of two sorts: either performable by particular men, or a certaine people, as fealty, rent seruice, and the like which make socage tenure: or else performable by a certain people only, as burgage: the seruile or base seruice, is villenage. Of all these seruices saue such only as haue bin before described I will speake somewhat, seuerally, briefely, and in order.
 Petite Sergeancy, is where a man holdeth his land of the king, paying yearely vnto him a bow, or a speare, or a dagger, or a launce, or a spurre of gold etc.Littlet. lib. 2. ca. 9. sect. 1. Knights seruice in Capite, is where a man holdeth his lands or tenements of the king as of his crown immediatly ab antiquo, by doing some warlike seruice. Grand sergeancy, is where a man holdeth his lands or tenements of the king as of his Crown immediatly, by doing some speciall seruice to the king in person; as by carrying his banner or launce, or by being his marshall, or sewer, or caruer, or butler, etc.Litt. li. 2. ca. 8. sect. 1. 23. H. 3. Gard. 148. of homage and fealtie hath been spoken before. Rent seruice, is where the tenaunt holdeth his lande of his Lord by a certaine rent, for which, if it be behind at the day, wherein it ought to be paied, the Lord may distraine for it of common right. Burgage, is where the tenants of an auncient borough, do hold lands within the Borough of the King or some other person, as of his borough by a certaine rent.Lit. li. 2. c. 10. sect. 1. 2. Villenage, is where a man holdeth of his Lord, either by doing vnto him some particular base seruice, and such a one is called a tenant by villenage, or by doing generally whatsoeuer base seruice his Lord will commaund and impose vpon him, and such a tenaunt is termed in our Law a villaine.Lit. li. 2. c. 11. sect. 1. and 2. This miserable estate of villenage, had his beginning soone after the diluge, and now by the consent of all nations it is ratified,3. The original of villenage and the nature thereof. for the West Indians though they haue no knowledge of diuine or humane Lawes, yet bondmen they haue, and the Mohometists make
 Christians their bondslaues, the Portugallians make villaines of the Mahometistes which they sell by companies as flockes of sheepe in the market.Bodin. lib. 1. de repub. c 5. The Romains had power by their law to sell or kill their villains:Tacit. li. 14. but for mittigation of cruelty the Law Petronia was made, whereby it was forbidden that none should put his villaine to death without cause, which law was executed by Nero,Senec. lib. 3. de benefic. and after by Adrianus:Sparcian in Adrian. but our law a more concionable fauorer of life hath restrained the hands of the Lord from the bloudshed of his villaine, and from the mayming of him,Litt' lib. 2. c. 11. Sect' 32. hauing regard to the Law of God which recompenseth these bondmen with freedom whom the Master hath by some blowes maymed,Exo. 21. ver. 26. and 27. which lawe Constant. the Emperor did put in practise,l. 1. de Eme^d, seruor. C. but al the lands and goods purchased and possessed by the villaine the law frankly giueth to the Lord, if he wil seise and claime the^,Litt' lib. 2. c. 11. sect' 8.10. wre^tched I co^fesse is the estate of such men, but yet patiently to be tollerated, because qua^ potestate alijs deferre voluim, ferre debemus, and they whose auncestors, or the^selues haue ackowledged the^selues to be villaines, must now duetifully beare the yoake, though Cui plus licet quam par est, plus vult quam licet,Gellius lib. 17. c. ^4. and let the Lords of such villaines hearken to that which is spoken of an heathen man diuinely: Boni moderatoris est restringere potestatem,Ammian. lib. 29. but to leaue these particulers and to proceed more generally, as one ma^ may hold lands of another by euery of these abouesaid seruices as of his person,4 The tenure wherby a man holdeth of a honor or Manor is described, and by examples illustrated. so likewise he may hold of him as of his Honor or Manor for if
 a man hold of the king as of any honor which is come to his highnes by disce^t from any of his ancestors, hee shall not holde in Capite, for by the words in the first Chapter of Prerogatiua regis, it is euident that if it shal be said a tenure in Capite, it must bee holden of the crowne of a long time, the words be ab antiquo de Corona, and that cannot bee when it is but newly comen to the Crowne, and the statute of Magna Charta c. 31. did (as Master Stamf. saieth) helpe this matter by expresse words, if such an honour came to the crowne by way of escheate, but not if it came by way of discent,5 Certaine honors which be not of the auncientnes of the Crowne. or any other way: and that statute doth set forth certain honours by name which be not of the ancientnes of the crowne, that is to say, the honor of Wallingford, Notingha^, Bullingbrook and Lancaster, therefore he that holdeth of the King, as of these Honors, holdeth not of the king in chiefe,Stamfords Praerog. c. 7. but other honors there bee which of so long time haue bin annexed to the Crowne, that to hold of the^ is to hold in chiefe, for whereas one held of the king as of a certaine honor,6 Some honors which are annexed to the Crowne. to yeeld a certaine rent to the keeping of the castell of Douer, this hath beene taken to bee a tenure in chiefe, and so it hath been thought if one hold of his highnes as of the Honor of the Abbe of Marle,Fitz. nat. bre. 259. and Anno vndecimo of king Henry the seuenth, the honour of Ralegh was annexed to the Crowne, therefore if any man hold as of that honor it is a tenure in capite,34. H. 8. Br. Cas. 230. and therefore there is a good rule in the Register of Writs, that a man shall not make a fine for alienation of lands
 held of the King as of his honour, but for lande held in Capite only: for there be certain honors which be held in Capite, and there is a certaine writ, that the Escheator shal not greeue any man for alienation of land held as of an honour, for that is as of an honor, and not as of the kings person, and no fine shal be paied for the alienation of such land.Regist. 184. Br. Alienac' 33 And whereas it was found by Office that land was held of the queen as of her principality of Wales, by the seruice of going with the Prince in Warre at the charge of the Prince, per curia^,18. El. Dy. per Curiam. this is no Tenure in capite. And Master Finchden putteth this diuersity, that where an Honour is seised into the Kings hands, if a Manor held of the Honor do escheat to the king by a common Escheat, if the King alien the Manor to hold of him, the tenaunt shall hold by the same seruices as hee helde by force of the Honour (for the Honour seemeth to bee vice domini in this case and as a meane Lord) but if it come to the King by forfeiture of warre or by some other treaso^, or by some other cause which toucheth the Kings person, and the king seiseth, and enfeoffeth another, the feoffee shall hold of the King as of his Crowne:47. E. 3. 21. per Finchden. and though the statute of Magna Charta ca. 31. before recited doe say, Si quis tenuerit de nobis de aliqua escaeta vt de honore Wallingford, Bolen etc. non faciet aliud seruitium quam fecit praeante: yet this is to be intended of a common Escheate and not otherwise.29. H. 8. Br. Ca. 114. So a man may holde of the King as of his Manour, and yet not holde in Capite, for it was found by
 office that one helde land of the King, as of his Manor of Plimpton, and other landes as of his Manour of Darington, which came to the king by the attainder of treason of the Marquesse of Excetor, this hath beene thought to be no Tenure in capite, for tenures in chiefe did begin in auncient time vpon the graunts of Kings to defend them against rebelles and enemies: and at this day the Queene may create a tenure in Capite, if shee giue land to hold of her person: otherwise it is if it be giuen to hold of an Honor, Manour, etc. for a Tenure in chiefe must bee immediatly of the King, and is created by the King onely: for a Tenure created by a subiect cannot be a Tenure in chiefe, nor haue any prerogatiue annexed vnto it, and if the tenants of an Honour should hold of the King in Capite, the Honour when it came to the King should bee destroyed, which may not be, and there is no reason that the tenaunt in whom there is no default should bee preiudiced in his tenancy by the offence of the Lorde,30. H. 8 44. Dyer. and if the Q. purchase a Manour of which I.S. holdeth by Knights seruice, the tenant shall hold as hee held before, and hee needeth not to tender his liuerie, nor primer seisin: for he doth not hold in Capite, but as of a Manour, and if his heire be in ward by reason thereof, he may haue an Ouster le maine at his ful age, and if the Queene grant the Manour afterward to W.N. in fee, excepting the seruices of I. S. now I. S. holdeth of the queen as of her highnesse person: yet he shall not holde in Capite
 but by such seruices as he helde by before of the Mannor: for the Queenes act may not preiudice her tenant,29. H. 8. Br. Ca. 113. but where a man holdeth of the Q. by reason of an other thing, as namely, by reason of a Mannour, this is no tenure in Capite,3. Eliz. Com^ 241. Wildgous case. but if the King be seised of a Mannour, and giueth to a stranger an acre of the Mannour, to haue and to hold to him and to his heires of his body engendred without expressing any seruice, the donee shal hold of the King by knights seruice in Capite,Ibid' 240. per Car. and tenures likewise may be to hold of one as of his person or of his Manor by diuers other seruices, as if a man had made a feoffeme^t of land before the statute, or a gift in taile sithe^ce the statute, to holde of him by the making of a bridge ouer certaine land, or by making a Beacon in the land giuen, this is a good tenure: for a man may holde of an other by doing seruice for a common good, as well as for the priuate profit of the Lord, as to repaire a bridge, or a high way, or by keeping such a Castle, for the Lord himselfe in this hath profit with others.11.

Nomom.
You haue taken some paines Anglonomoph.  in describing the particular kindes of tenures:1 Whether one within age be co^pellable by law to doe all manner of seruice either by himselfe or some other. now I would heare somewhat of Codicgn. whether one within age be excused from personall seruice, because his age is not fit to serue, so that the seruice age is suspended vntill the maturitie of his age: or whether he shalbe compelled to doe his seruice by a substitute.


Codicgn.
To dissolue that question, a difference is to bee taken, for either the Father of the Heire

There be many conclusions in our Lawe aunswerable to that which you haue said,3. Some causes of forfeiture at the common Law. for it hath bene affirmed, that if a man holde his land of his Lord by homage and fealtie, and hee hath done homage and fealtie to his Lord, and the Lorde hath issue a sonne and dyeth, and the Seignorie discendeth to the sonne, in this case the tenaunt which hath done homage to the father, shall not do homage to the sonne, because when a Tenaunt hath once done homage to his Lord, hee is excused for tearme of life to doe homage to any other heire of the Lord,Littur lib. 2. c. 7. sect' 13. But if a man bee seised of a Mannour, and an other man holdeth land of him as of the foresayde Mannour by homage, and hath done his homage vnto him, and a stranger bringeth a Precipe quod reddat against the owner of the Mannour, and recouereth the Mannour against him, and sueth execution, in this case the Tenaunt shall againe doe homage to him that recouered the Mannour, though hee haue done homage before, because the estate of him who receiued the first homage, is def^ated by the Recouerie, and it lyeth not in the mouth of the Tenaunt to falsifie or defeate the Recouerie which was against his Lord.Littur ibid sect' 17. And if a Tenaunt which ought by his Tenure to doe homage to his Lord, come to his Lord, and say vnto him, that hee is readie to doe him homage for the tenements which hee holdeth of him, and the Lord doth then refuse to receiue it, after such refusall the Lord cannot distreigne
 the Tenaunt for the homage, before the Lord require him to doe homage vnto him, and hee refuseth,Littur lib. 2. c. 7 sect' 19. 20. and he that holdeth by Knights Seruice of the King, neede not goe to warre with him, if hee will finde a sufficient person conueniently armed, and fit to goe with the King, and this seemeth good reason: For it may bee, that hee that holdeth by such seruices, doth languish in sicknesse, so that hee cannot goe, nor ryde: And a Feme sole which holdeth by such seruices, may not in such case goe in proper person, and it hath beene said, that Escuage shall not bee graunted vnlesse the King goe to warre himselfe in proper person, and after such a voyage royall it hath beene likewise affirmed, that by authoritie of Parliament Escuage shall bee assesed and put in certaine how much euerie one that holdeth by an entyer Fee of Knights Seruice, which was not with the King by himselfe or by an other for him, shall pay to his Lord of whom hee holdeth by Escuage, as if it bee ordeigned by authoritie of Parliament, that euery one which holdeth by an entyer Fee of Knights seruice, that was not with the King nor any other, etc. for him shall pay to his Lord fortie shillings, then euery one that holdeth of his Lord by the moitie of a Knights Fee, shall pay to his Lord fourtie shillings, and hee that holdeth by a fourth part, tenne shillings, and so pro rataLittur lib. 2. c. 3. sect' 5 6. 8. 7.

 in case of felonie, for in case of treason the King shall bee presently after the attainder in actuall possession without office found by the statute of 33.

 medicine and not in fourme of a penaltie: and as it hath the effect of a punishment euery one is punished for his owne fault onely: but as it hath the effect of a medicine, so one man is punished for an others fault, that by suffering shame hee may be deterred from crime) yet heere it may be said, what place is there left for innocencie if the most guiltles, may be punished for the misdeameanor of the most guilty; for as it is not the fault of the corne that it groweth in a bad soile, so it is not the fault of the sonnes that they are begotten of lewd fathers, therefore it may seeme meete and expedient that there should be ibi paena, vbi culpa: and that offences should rest vpon the authors, and that the falle shoulde goe no further then the fault, and there is a Law in Deutronom.

The possession in co^mon of beasts, doth co^tinue vntil they haue yong, if the possession were limitted at the first vntill they had young: and if two be agreed to be tenants in common of al the profits of a certain ground, the tenancy in common ceaseth not till all the profits be taken: and therefore if two be agreed to be tenants in common from the Calends of March, vntil such time as their fields are new to be tilled and sowne, they shalbe tenants in common vnto the Calendes of Nouember, because betwixt both the Calendes the fields may be tilled and so wen, or suppose that they haue contracted a tenancie in common of kine, from the Calends of Iuly, vntill they haue yong, this tenancie in common shal continue till

2 That by the Common law the word ex c^^^^ am must bee v^ed in the exchange.By our Law there must be the expresse word of exchange mentioned, otherwise a thing can not be said to passe by exchange, for the word excambium only maketh an excha^ge, as the words liberu^ maritagium only do make frankmariage:


 for if I giue to one an acre of land by deed indented, and he by the same deed giueth to mee another acre for this acre, nothing passeth except liuery be made, and then the liuery onely transferreth the land: otherwise it had beene if the word (exchaunge) had beene vsed in the deede, and the estate which the parties are to haue in the land exchanged ought to be equall:3 That the estates must be equall. and Choke saith, that both the things exchanged, ought to be in esse at the time of the exchaunge, and therfore an exchange of land for rent granted de novo, is not good,4 That the things exchanged must be in Esse. but an exchaunge betwixt a rent and a common which are in esse at the time of the exchange, is good, and so it is of land and rent:9. E. 4. 21. per Brian, Choke, and Nedham. And according to his opinion an exchange of the right which the disseisee hath, to the land wherof the disseisin is committed, for an acre of land in which the disseisor hath right, is no good exchange:3. E. 4. 10. per Choke. And where the word (exchange) is mentioned, though the conueyance bee but an Indenture of Couenants, yet it shall amount to a good Exchange: for an Indenture of couenants was made betwixt a Prior and the Master of Gunnell Hall in Cambridge, that the Master should haue three acres of land to him and to his successours, in perpetuall exchange for one chamber of two chambers to bee assigned by the said Master at his election to the said Prior and his successors; this hath beene held to be a good exchaunge, though it bee by way of Couenant:9. Ed. 4. 38. And though it bee avouched for lawe, that if by a deed of composition
 it be agreed betwixt two, that the one shall haue such lands in allowance of other landes belonging to him, that this is a good exchange:3. E. 3. 19. yet I doubt whether an exchange may be acco^plished by such counteruaileable words:5. That an excha^ge is good, though the one pa t of it doe inure by way of extinguishment. but a man may giue la^d in exchange for a release which cannot iniure but only by way of extinguishme^t, though there be some authority against it,7. E. 3. 37. and therefore Nortons opinio^ is iustly denied by Thorpe, whereas he held that in euery exchaunge there must be a mutuall transmutation of the possession,16. E. 3. Exchange 2. for if a man release to another his estouer of woode, which he is to take yearely in his wood, in exchaunge for land giuen to him in exchaunge for the same release, this is a good exchange though the release take effect by way of extinguishme^t: but it is as great a profite and aduauntage to the tenant to be discharged of the estouers, as if so much had beene graunted vnto him out of another mans wood,Park. tit. Exchange 53. 31. E. 1. Exchange 16. and the Law well perceiueth the profit which a man may haue by way of extinguishment, for if the father being tenant in taile doe alien the land entailed with warrantie, and hath a rent charge in fee issuing out of the lande of his Sonne which doth discend vnto the sonne, this is a good assets in value notwithstanding the extinguishment.31.

The reason in our Lawe wherefore suche cclesiasticall persons,3. That by the Common law Ecclesiastical persons their patrons and ordinaries ioyning together cannot make any good exchange of Ecclesiasticall benefices. nor their patrons and ordinaries, though they all agree cannot exchaunge the inheritances of spirituall liuings, is because the statute strictly prouideth that no alienation be made in mortmaine: for a thing which was amortised before, may be again amortised, and therefore if a religious person do appropriate a Church which is of his owne presentation without the kings licence, it is forfeited though it were amortised before,19. E. 3. Mortmain 8. and in such case where one Abbot did alien to another, the collusion was to bee inquired of, as well as in the alienation of land made by a secular man to a religious corporation,16. Afs. pl. 1. for the wordes of the statute of Mortmaine bee verie strong and large against such purchasors,4. That th^ statute of Mortmain is most strict and pregnant in words. which are thus: Prouisum est quod nullus religiosus emere, vel sub colore donationis, aut termini, aut alterius tituli cuiuscunque ab aliquo recipere, aut arte vel ingenio sibi appropriare praesumat, per quod terrae, and tenementa huiusmodi ad manum mortuam quocunque que modo deueniant,Stat. de religios. 7. E 1. Mortmain. 3. and therefore the case was,
 that a femme sole purchased lande in fee, and tooke to husband the villeine of a Bishop, which hee had in right of his Bishopricke, and the Bishop entred and this was adiudged a mortmain, for according to Wickinghams opinio^ the words of the statute of Mortmaine are quocunque modo: otherwise it shall bee if the tenant of the Bishop do die without heire,41. E. 3. 21. but 19. Henr. 6. the contrary is held to be law, but if the villeine himselfe purchase land, it is held there that in such case a Bishop or an Abbot cannot enter,19. H. 6. 56. but Thorps opinion is 41. E. 3. that though he may not enter in the case aforesaid, yet he may retaine the land against the villein, and the king may afterward ratifie his estate, which is no more in plain tearmes, then that an estate so gained is voidable only and not void, and as to the exchange of benefices betwixt parson and parson it is seuerally punished by edict of Parliament in our realme.31.

First I pray you tell me,  whether this manner and custome of disposing by a mans last will and testament, hath bin in ancient time practised or no.


Codicgn.
It is verie auncient,1. The antiquity of wills. for it was one of the Lawes of the twelue Tables, Vti legassit suae rei ita ius esto,L verbis legis ff. de verb. signif. But before Solons time it was not lawul for a man to deuise his goods Extra familia^, to strangers: and therefore, when Solon did (by law established) gra^t this libertie to the Athenians, it was plausibly receiued of them, and accompted the best of all his laws.Plutarch. in Solon. But Plato in his writings straungely, howsoeuer diuinely conceited, dispraiseth this law,2. Plato his exception against Solon hi law concerning willes. and calleth the makers of it childish, because by that meane, a window is opened to deceit, and to flattery: for he saith, that when men are at point of death, they beginne to dote, and their vnderstanding is broken, and therefore it is very likely, that euery man dying will dispose and appoint many things contrarie to the Lawe, to the vsuall practise of them that liue, and to the example of their ancestors.Plat. li. 11. de legib. This sentence of Plato, Iustinian an Emperour exquisitely busied in the compiling of Lawes, because hee had rather erre with Plato, then
 yeelde vnto the truth with Solon, alloweth, and frameth his Lawes accordingly,Authent. de trient. and sem. in l. Paulus ad Treb. and S. Ierome writeth, that Solons Lawe was repealed in his time, because Priestes which were commonly imployed in the making of Willes, did greedily and odiously drawe to themselues, the inheritance of the dead,L. 1. C. de sacr. Eccles. and another reason may be added in defence of Platoes opinion: because men in daunger of death are for the most part too prodigall, which Aristotle noted,Diogen. Laerti. in vit. Aristotel. and Tacitus pronounceth more peremptorily speaking of Otho,Tacit. lib. 2. histor. Pecunias distribuit parce, nec tanquam periturus, hauing affirmed before, Difficilius est temperare,3. Solons law is maintained and defended against Plato. qua te non putes diu vsurum. But Solons Lawe leaneth to a more stable roote, then that it may bee shaken by the weake blaste of such colourable reprehensions: and Solon did make exceptions to his Lawe for hee made these testaments voide which were made by any in the extremitie of his disease, or which a man was inforced to make by imprisonment or torment, or by the perswasions and flatterie of his wife: but surely the making of Willes is necessarie,L. 3. D. qui test. fa. pos. and without it men cannot effect the good education and bringing vp of their children, nor bee able of their proper goods, chattels, and other mooueable substance to discharge their debts, and after their degrees set foorth and aduance their children and posterity:32.

^ Master Parkins his opinio^ touching the deuising of an obligation is examined.Master Perkins, a man that writeth of diuers Titles of our Law, rather subtilly, than soundely, saieth, that if twentie pounds bee due to a man vpon an obligation or a contracte, which ought to be paid at the feast of Easter, and he deuiseth it to a straunger, this is a good deuise, if the money bee afterward paid: but if hee had deuised the obligation, or the counterpaine of the Indenture of couenantes, wherein the bond is conteined, the deuisee shall not vse an action vppon the bonde in his owne name, but he may giue or sell the obligation to the obligor, or to a straunger,Perkins 101. sect' 527. but how bondes, or things in action may passe directly from one to another by way of graunt, or deuise, I cannot yet perceiue by any authenticke opinion in our yere bookes: for to say that the especialtie, or bonde conteyning the debt or duety, doth passe vnto the deuisee, though the debt doe not passe, as namely the parchment, ynke, and waxe, but not the summe conteigned, is as if one shoulde imagine, that a man roweth ouer the Thames in body, and yet remaineth at the Temple staires in soule; for if the debtte beeing principall doe not passe, I cannot vnderstand how the parchment or paper, or the deede it selfe, being the accessorie can passe, for accessorium sequitur suum principale.

I thinke quite contrarie because there is a confidence reposed specially and incommunicably in the person of Titius, and there bee many cases in our Lawe to proue this assertion, Cesty que vse before the statut of 27. of king H. 8.
 did deuise that A.B. and C. his feoffees should sell his land,2. That by the Common law where a confidence is reposed in certaine persons, it is incommunicaable to others. whereof they were seised to his vse. A. dyeth: it was helde that B: and C. could not sell the land, otherwise it had beene if hee had spoken generally of his feoffees, without naming them specially:2. El. 177. Dy. Likewise a man deuised, that after the death of his wife, his land should bee sold by his executors together with the assent of A. and maketh his wife, and a stranger his executors and dyeth: the wife dyeth, A. dyeth, the authority of selling the land is fully determined and gone:5. Eli. 219. Dy. and so it was held per curiam, that if a man did declare his will, that B. and C. his executors should sell his land and the testator dieth, and B. dieth: and C. maketh M. his executor and dieth, and M. selleth it, this sale is void, for the trust is strict: but M. Brudnell saieth that if a man deuise by his will that H. and N. his executors shall sell his land, and they refuse to be executors, yet they may sell the land, because they are named by their proper names:19. H. 8. 9. But where the executors are not specially named for the sale of the land, there one of them only may well enough sell the land: for the case was, that a man did deuise all his lands to his sister, except one manor, which he appointed to pay his debts, and hee made two executors and dyed, the one executor dyed, yet the other may sell the mannour and pay the debtes per intentionem testatoris, the words of the deuise as touching the sale were generall (which I appointe to pay my debts.23.

A man deuised land to one so that he doe pay 10. li. and if not that it should remain to his house, prouided that the lands shall not be sold, but shall goe to the next of bloud being male, it was helde that this was an estate taile, and that these words (shall go to his house) shall bee construed to the eldest person of his familie, and these words (being male) shall bee construed in the future tense, and in many cases an estate may be limited in a deuise by implycation: as if a man deuise lande to one and to his heires males in fee simple, the remainder to the next heires males of the kinne, there is an intaileme^t both in the first estate and also in the remainder,16. Eli. 333. Dy. 2. Eli. 171. Dy. but where a deuise is contrary to Law, it is voide of effect:3. That the Common law frustrateth these deuises which are repugnant to Law. for a man deuised land in London to the Prior and Couent of S.

That there is a diuersity in the Ciuill law where a man make^h his wife vsutructuariam of his goods, and where he deuiseth them to her. where hee maketh his wife by his will vsufructuariam of the goods, and where he doth deuise vnto her his goods: For where he maketh her vsufructuariam, shee may of her owne power take the profit and benefit of the goods, and she needeth not to expect or attend the curtesie of the executor:L. si habitatio. @. si vsus fu^di. and l. fundi ff. de vsu and hab. But if hee deuise his goods, or the profit of his goods, or commaund and charge his heire or executor by his will, that they allow sufficient maintenaunce to his wife out of his lands or goods, now the woman is a deuisee, and she must take that which is deuised, by the ha^ds of the heire or executor, or else sue for it by law.ff de vsufruct. legat l. patrimonij and l. si quis.

By our law the power and authority of deliuering goods and chattels,2.

H. 6. but if a man deuise a booke or some other thing to
 one for terme of life, the remainder to another for euer, if the executor deliuer the booke or the goods to the first deuisee, the second deuisee may seise them without liuery of the executor, for the possession of the first deuisee was the possessio^ of them both, otherwise it is if the first deuisee hath the possessio^ and die37. H. 6. 30.: but if a man seise in another right then as deuisee, then hee need not depend vpon the deliuery of the executors: and therefore the case was 9.

2. That the Common law acknowledgeth this difference in substance and effect.From this diuersitie our Law dissenteth not: for when a man lendeth to another money, and paieth it into his hands, or some other for him, which you terme a naturall lending, if this be vntill a certaine day, and the day be incurred, and the mony not payed, the creditor may sue an Action of Debt against the debtourFitz. na. br. 119.

Let me know now whether vsurie,  or lending for interest, be prohibited by your Laws yea or no? and me thinkes (to speake by way of obiection) that it should not, for first it seemeth nor repugnant to the law of nature or to naturall reason,1. An vsurious lending, or lending of mony for inte est, is by way of obiection maintained. because reason enforceth and nature mooueth vs to this, that wee should do well to them that haue done well to vs, otherwise wee might incurre the fault of ingratitude, which drieth vp the very fountaine of liberalitie, and besides by the Law of nature it is lawfull for euery one to lend of his owne as he list, and to receiue for his owne as it pleaseth him: and it seemeth to bee permitted by the Lawe of God when it is said: Ego veniens cu^ vsuris exegissem illud,Luc. 19. and so it is appointed in Deutronom. Faeneraberis gentibus multis,Deuter. 29. And hereto agreeth the opinion of Aquinas,2. Aquinas his authority is vrged for proofe hereof. who writing vpon Ecclesiast. saith thus: Faenerare proximo tuo in tempore necessitatis illius: And againe: Redde proximo tuo in tempore suo. Multi quasi inuentionem aestimauerunt faenus and praestiterunt molestiam suis qui se adiuuerunt. Donec accipiat osculatur dantis manum, and in promissionibus humiliat vocem suam, and in tempore redditionis postulabit tempus, and loquetur verba taedij and murmurationum, and tempus causabiturAquin. in Ecclesi. c. 29.: And surely me thinkes it is a point of brotherly loue to lende vnto a needy brother a competent summe of mony, so much as will serue him for a reasonable surplusage of increase.



Cononol..
3 The obiection is answered ^ed by the Comonist.Vsurie may well be called the diuels charitie: for as the diuell cannot do any good howsoeuer hee would seeme to do it, because it is against his nature to do any good thing: so his charitie howsoeuer it may seeme to do good, yet in truth cannot performe any good thing, because the nature of it is opposite to al goodnesse, being by Cato resembled to murther, by the Canon law to theft:Ca^si quis vsuram: l. 4. q. 4. yet it maketh some shew to do good, but so as if a man were troubled with a burning ague, and greatly inflamed in his bodie, should in the extreamitie of his heate aske a cuppe of single beere of one that standeth by, and and he reacheth it vnto him, this cooleth the heate for a time, and the sicke man thanketh him for it, but when the disease doth reuert vppon him, and his fittes grow worse then they were before, and hee perceiueth that the drinke which hee drunke hath two much inflamed him; then he beginneth to complaine of the hurtful courtesie and pitie of the other man: so when the vserer lendeth mony at the first, hee that boroweth it thanketh him and thinketh himselfe deeply beholding to him, but in the end when hee findeth that his goodes decrease, and his dettes increase by the vsurers kindnesse, when not onely pot and panne, but euen garmentes and iewels must bee either gaged or sold to satisfie the vserer, and whe^ they perceiue the Bee that had a flower in her mouth to haue a sting in her taile, then (that is to say) too late they finde that vnder this baite, lyeth a hooke, vnder this charitie, crueltie. And as to Aquinas his opinion
 of this matter quis tumidu^ guttur miretur in Alpibus?4. Aquinas his authoritie disproued. and who will wonder if Aquinas patronize an errour in diuinity? yet hee defendeth it strangely; for he holdeth in the very same place, that it is prohibited by the law of God, and yet that it may be tolerated in a politik respect, is not this Theomachein? is not this to permit vnto flesh and bloud, which the spirit of God hath forbidden, but to answere you more particularly: First, vsurie is against the lawe of nature, because it is against the law of nature that money should ingender money, and against the Lawe of God, in which it is said: Si pecuniam mutuo dederis pupillo meo pauperi, non vrgebis eu^ quasi exactor nec vsuris opprimes,Exod. 22. and againe mutuum date, nihil inde sperantes, and by our law it is flatly forbidden.14. quest 4. ca. 1. cum sequent. and in Clem. 1. de vsur.

So it seemeth by our Law which in this professeth it selfe to imitate the Canon Law for the Emperor saith of this matter,5. The Ciuill law in conde^ning vsurie agreeth with the Canon law leges non dedignantur imitari sacros Canones, and he commandeth the foure generall Counsels to be obserued, wherein vsurie is forbidden.l. 1.

It winketh at it as he that shooteth in a Caleeuer at birdes,6 The co^mon law in this ag eeth with ^oth other Lawes. who winketh with one eye and woundeth with the other, so our Law seeth not when the vsurer letteth forth his money to interest, but when an information is exhibited against him then it seeth the fact, condemneth the fault, and punisheth the offendour:
 and though he take but after the rate of 10. li. in the hundred, yet he shall forfeit the full value of the interest, and worthily truely doth the statute note vsurie with termes of disgrace censuring it to be vice, increasing by corrupt shifts, to the importable hurt of the common wealth.13.

The change of money may happen two waies, for either it may bee chaunged in respect of the matter, wherof it is made, as if in stead of siluer, brasse-coine be vsed, or in stead of gold, siluer: for the auncient Germaines, as Tacitus reporteth, had siluer in greater price then golde,Tacit. de moribus Germonor. and in Pisana siluer money is of more accompt then golde, because the people of that countrie doe pay many tributes and taxes to the Pope, whose collectors and officers will not take any payment in gold, in Sparta yron-mony was only in vse,Polyb. lib. 6. Plutarch. in Lych. or els it may be changed in the value, as if a Floren, whi^h was worth 4. li. to be debased to 3. li. for in the value of mony, neither the matter nor forme is respected,^. A diuersitie in the Ciuill law when money is tendered at the day of payment, and is after embased, and when it is tendered after. but the determination of the Prince, wherefore Aristotle said well, that mony is not ce^sured by nature but by law, and is of such value, as the law published of it doth determine,Aristot. lib. 5 Ethic. which Galen likewise sheweth,Galen lib. 2. de puls. diff. in both these cases if the debaseme^t were before the day of paime^t the debtor may pay the det in the coin

1. The definition of depositum by the ciuil law.Depositum, is that which is committed to the credit and faithfulnesse of a man, to keepe safely to the vse of him that deliuereth it, to the ende that it may be restored, when he shall call for it,l. 1. ff. depos. vbi doct', and in l. quod seruns eod. and dict. l. 1. @. est autem, and @. penult. and l.

H. 6. 20. or in a chest, or coffer, to deliuer to another and hee to whom they are deliuered will not deliuer them ouer accordingly, he to whom they should bee deliuered, may haue a Writ of Detinue, but if a man deliuer money to one being not in a bagge or coffer, to redeliuer to him, or to deliuer ouer to a straunger, in such case, neither he that deliuereth, nor he to whom the money, or goods are to bee deliuered, shall haue a Writ of Detinue for the money, but a Writ of Accompt, because a Writ of Detinue
 ought to be of a thing certaine,3. A diuersity where a writ of Accompt, of Detinue, and of Trespas are to be brought concerning things deliuered at the co^mon law. as of money in a bagge, or of a horse, or twentie kine, or such things in certaine,Fitz. na. br. 138.

E. 4. 36. or if he doe burne or consume the things deliuered vnto him,33 H. 6. 26. per Litt. 20. H. 6.17. So where a deed is deliuered to one to deliuer ouer vpon a condition to be performed to a stranger, and hee deliuereth it without mencioning the condition, a Writ of Detinue will lye against the first Baylie, and no other remedie may be had,9. H. 6. 37. per Curiam. and where I deliuer goods, and a straunger taketh them out of the possession of the Baylie, I may haue a Writ of Detinue against the straunger, or against my Baylie,20. E. 4. 11. for my Baylie is charable into whose ha^ds soeuer the goods do come: but if he deliuer them ouer to another, that bayly is not chargeable to me, but only for the possession.12. E. 4. 12.

Suppose that a man infeoffeth me  of certaine landes with warranty, who retayneth all the deeds and euidences concerning the landes in his owne possession, whether may these deedes after liuerie made to me of the lands bee said to bee my depositum in his hands as a thing which I haue left in his handes, and whether will a Writ of Detinue lye for them at the common law?

They cannot be said to bee deposita in his hands,1 That a thing cannot be said to be a depositum at the ciuil law, except it be deliuered to the party. because a thing cannot be said to bee depositu^, except it be deliuered to the party,l. 1. ff. de pos. and ibi Doct'. and
 if these writings, which you speake of, do belong to the feoffor, as I thinke they do, then they cannot be said to be deposita: for wee haue a rule in our law, that res propriae frustra deponuntur apud dominum cum ex deposito non obligetur, and it is contra bona^ fidem that the owner should redeliuer his goods (in which he hath a propertie) to another man.l. bona fides ff depos in fi..

2. That by the common law feoffee of the land is to haue the charters when the feoffement is without warrantie: otherwise it is. when it is with warrantie.It is good to bee considered to whom these charters or deedes aboue mentioned do belong. The authoritie is very pregnant, that if a man make a feoffement of his land to an other by deede, the feoffee shall haue the charters concerning the land, though the feoffor doe not expresly giue them to the feoffee.18. E. 4. 14. 9. E. 4. 53. 39 E. 3. 22. 7. H. 4. 7. 34. H. 6. 1. And if a man make a lease for terme of yeares, and after confirme the estate of the lessee in fee, and he to whom the confirmation was made dyeth, now his heire shall haue as well the deede of the lease for tearme of yeares, as the deede of confirmation, because that deede maketh the confirmation good,9. E. 4. 53. Fitz. na. br. 138. K. and so where a gift is made to one for life, the remainder to another in taile, if the donour release all his right to the tenaunt for life, hee in the remainder cannot haue a Writ of Detinue for his release after the death of the tenaunt for terme of life:9. H. 6. 54. But in the case which you haue proposed, because the feoffement is with Warrantie, so that the feoffour is bounde to Warrantie, nowe the feoffee shall not haue the charters concerning the lande, for so the feoffour might fayle of the
 maintenance of his warranty, and so if a man be infeoffed with warranty and after infeoffeth another with warrantie, the heire of the feoffour may haue a Writ of Detinue against a straunger in whose possession are any deedes or charters concerning the land, because he may haue aduantage of this Warrantie,Fitz. na. br. ibid. L. but let the feoffement or gift bee made without warrantie, it is cleere that the donee or feoffee may claime the charters concerning the inheritance de iure, and therefore if a gift of land be made to A. in taile, the remainder to B. in fee, and after A. dyeth without issue, B. shall haue the deede,3. H. 7. 15. so if lands be giuen to two, and the heires of one of them by deed, now if the tenant for life die he that hath the fee simple shall haue the Writ of Detinue for the deede,Fitz. na. br. 138. F. for the deede runneth with the lande and is of the nature of the inheritance, and therefore a repleuin lyeth not for such charters,4. H. 4. 7. 10. and it is said by Newton 22. H. 6. that hee in the remainder in taile shall not haue a Writ of Detinue against the tenant for terme of life, if he haue the deed specifying the remainder, yet he cannot haue a Forme done in the remainder, nor an Action of Waste without shewing the deede.22.

The tenth Dialogue of the forme of ordinarie proceeding in matters of Law.

NOmomat.
It remaineth Codicgn. that  ye should now speak of the forme and manner of ordinary proceeding in matters of Lawe, which because it dependeth wholly vpon the practise and custome of Courts, in which I haue imployed no great trauaile, nor obserua^ce, I must therefore request you to stretch your sinewes in this regarde, and not onely to argue, but open things vnto me, and be not angry with mee, if in the handling of these matters I bring ye from the hill, that is your high and intricate pointes, to the valley or plaine, that is to matters more plaine and easie, and againe from the valley to the hill, when I finde in my selfe strengthe of vnderstanding to ascende. First I pray you shew vnto mee what is to bee done at the commencement or beginning of a suite or action.1 The things which are to be obserued of the plaintife at the beginning of a suit by the Ciuil law.


Codicgn.
Because in euery controuersie of law, there must be a plaintife and a defendant, it is not amisse nor impertinent to mention such things as ought to be obserued and regarded of the plaintife, when he draweth any man into suit: and they are three in number, the one concerning profit, the other necessitie, and the third vrbanitie. It is a point of profit or warinesse for the plaintife
 before he commence suit against any, to be well aduised and assured whether himselfe bee a lawfull person to stand in iudgement, and to demaund that which hee bringeth into question,l. 1. C. qui legit. person. standi in iud. hab. he ought likewise to be sure that hee haue a good cause of controuersie, or else in some cases he must be adiudged to pay the costes to the defendaunt: in other some hee must beare the losse of the charges of the suite,l eum quem temere ff. de iudicijs. likewise hee ought to beware, least hee drawe the defendant before an incompetent Iudge. 2. It is a point of necessity that the partie whome the plaintife sueth, bee cited, or summoned before: for against the partie not summoned, nor heard, nothing can bee determined,l. de vnoquoque ff. de re. iud. etc. 1. ext. de caus. poss. and proprietat. 2 Citation is proued to be of the substa^ce of the proceeding, contrary to the opinio in of some ciuilians. Citation (as wee say) is parcel of the Law of nature,Cle^. pastoralis de re iud. therefore of necessitie the party defendant must be summoned, because in euerie action the iudgement hath a retrospect to the original, and to the summons (and as wee say in plain tearmes) to that part of the action which is de in ius vocando:Ext. de procurat. C. in nostra in fin. and l. prolata^ C. de sent. and interloq. om. iud. otherwise the iudgme^t is erronious,Iusti. de offic. iud. in princ. and in @. omnem in authe^. delitigios. Gloss. in cap prudentia. @. 1. de offic. de leg. because Citation is of the substance of the proceeding, for that is the beginning of the suit, howsoeuer some holde opinion that the suit is not begun ante litis contestationem,d. authe^. de litigios. @. si vero a preside. l. apertissimi. C. de Iudic. before the appearance of the partie def. and the libel exhibited in Court, and notice taken thereof by the def. by some responsory acte, because (say they) post litis contestatione non potest forum declinari,ff. de iudic. l. 1 and 2. and C. de litis ^ontest. the iurisdictio^ cannot be auoided after the appara^ce and the exhibiting of the libel, and any kind of answere applied, but others hold in my opinio^ more
 agreeable to the truth, that it is one of the fundamentall beginnings of the suit, and one of the essentiall and formall parts of the iudgement, because the omitting of it doth frustrate the iudgement.l. de vno quoque ff. de reiud. and in c. 1. de caus. poss. and proprietat. extra. 3. The other point is a matter of ciuilitie, or curtesie, because humanitie doth require that before any man do contend in suit, and do prepare and addresse himselfe ad experiendu^ su^mumius, that he friendly and mildely doe admonish him, with whom he is to deale, of his duetie, that if by faire meanes he may be won, the rigor of law may not be exercised.l. quid vberius ff. de seruitut. vrban. pred. and l. debitores C. de pign.

These cautels which your law prescribeth to such as enter into suit,3. The cautels to be obserued at the commo^ law in the co^mencement of an action. are not vtterly reiected of our law, for as to the two first which concerne profit and necessity, our law doth rigorously exact them: as to the other it is not against it, for it doth not forbid, nor hinder any man to bee courteous to another, but it being a science rather politike then mortall, doth more respect the Iustice of causes, then the courteous gestures of men, our law doth vrge men to deale well and honestly, and if they do otherwise it doth punish the^, but curtesie is a free, spontaneal and ingenious quality, to which no inforcement may be vsed, but I will first examine by your patience, how farre forth our law regardeth the abilitie of the person, which is to impleade another, and then by course will examine all the partes of your precedent speech, inquiring by our bookes howe they may sort, and be sutable to our law. First it hath beene receiued of vs as a currant
 rule from all antiquity,4. Disableme^ts in the person of the plaintife at the common law. that the defendant may pleade outlawrie in disablement of the plaintife, but if he doe imparle now he cannot plead outlawrie to the disablement of his person, but yet he may well pleade it in barre of the action,32. H. 6. 3^ 35. H. 6. 36. so in a Writ brought by one as sonne and heire to I.S. after imparlance the tenant cannot pleade to the Writte that hee is bastarde, or that hee is not heire, but hee may very well pleade it in barre of the action,22. E. 4. 35. and so outlawrie is a good plea in barre of an Action of Debt: for by the outlawrie of the plaintife, the debt if it growe by especialtie is vested in the Queene, otherwise it is of an action of debt vpon a contract:16. E. 4. 4. for in that case the debtor might wage his lawe against the debtee who is outlawed, and as it seemeth by 10. Henr. 7. the outlawrie goeth rather in barre of the Action, then to the Writ, for there it is saide, that where a man cannot pleade to the Writ, but by shewing of a matter in barre, there hee may shewe it and conclude to the writ: for in an action of debt a man may pleade outlawrie in the plaintife, and conclude to the person, and yet the matter goeth in barre, and hee may pleade it also in barre,10. H. 7. 11. and conclude to the action, and after that a voucher is counterpleaded, and the tenaunt put to another aunswere, hee may notwithstanding plead that the demaundaunt is outlawed,21. E. 4. 64. but after voucher the tenaunt may not plead to the fourme of the Writte,5. E. 3. 223. and 32. Henr. 6. is verie plaine, that where a man pleadeth that the plaintife is
 an alien borne, or a villaine, or an outlawed person it is left to his choise, whether hee will conclude these speciall matters to the writ or to the action,32. H. 6. 27. and though the defendant haue made an atturney in a repleuin, yet hee may afterward alledge that the plaintife is his villaine,29. E. 3. 24. So 21. Rich. 2. in Assise brought by the husbande and wife against diuerse persons, the tenaunts sayd that the wife of the plaintife was entred into religion in the house of B. and there was a Nun professed, and demanded iudgement if she should be aunswered, and the Assise was adiourned into the common place, and a writ was sent to the Bishop to certifie, who certified that shee was professed, wherefore the defendants prayed that the husband and wife might bee barred for euer, and it was helde by the whole Court, that forsomuch as the plea did stretch onely to disable the wife of the plaintife, and if the husbande and wife had purchast ioyntly, that the baron should notwithstanding the disablement haue an Assise of the whole, but otherwise it is if the husbande and wife bring an Assise, and a feoffement or release of the husbande or the wife or of some auncestour of one of them bee pleaded in barre, both of them shall bee barred, therefore in this case it was helde that the iudgement ought not to bee that the husband should be barred, but by the aduise of the whole Court it was awarded that the husbande and the wife nihil capiant per breue suum, sed essent in misericordia.21. R. 2. Iudgem^t 263. and in the thirde yeare of Henrie the
 sixth it was held a good plea to say that the demandant was an alien borne in Portugall, which is out of the Kings legeance with conclusion, sil serra respondu.3. H. 6. 11: and therefore master Theloall in his Digest of writtes well obserueth, that an exception taken to a writ propter defectum nationis, vel potius defectum subiectionis, vel ligeantiae is peremptorie, and that the action cannot bee reuiued by peace, or league subsequent, and that the King may graunt licence to aliens to impleade, and likewise that such aliens as come into the Realme by the Kinges licence and safe conducte may vse personall Actions by Writte, though they bee not made Denizens, and that Denizens lawfully made by the Kings graunt, and such Aliens borne which are within the expresse wordes of the statute of 25. of Edward the thirde, may vse Actions reall by originall Writte,Thelo. Digest de briefes li. 1. ca. 6. And where a man is excommunicated, and hee sueth an Action reall or personall, the tenant or defendant may pleade that the plaintife is excommunicated, and hereof he ought to shewe the Bishoppes Letters vnder his Seale, testifying the excommunication, and then he may demande iudgement whether he ought to be answered,Litt. lib. 2. ca. 21. sect. 42. but if the demaundant or plaintife cannot deny this, the Writ shall not abate, but the iudgement shalbe that the tenant or def. shall go quite without day: because when the demanda^t or plaintife hath purchased letters of absolution, and they are shewed forth to the Court, he may haue a resummons or reattachment vpon his originall
 according to the nature of this Writ,Litt' ibid. and whereas you say, that it behoueth the plaintife to be sure that hee haue a good cause of action least he pay the costes, that now by statute is made common Law, for by the statute of 23. H.^ The statute of 23 H. 8. of giuing damages to the defenda^t is compared with the rule of the ciuill Law. H. 8. it is enacted that if any person or persons, co^mence or sue in any Court of Recorde, or elsewhere, in any other Court, any action, bille, or plaint of trespasse vpon the statute of King Richarde the seconde, made in the fifthe yeare of his raigne for Entries into landes or tenements where no entrie is giuen by the Law, or any action, bill, or plaint of debt or couenant vpon any especialtie made to the plaintife or plaintifes, or vpon any contract supposed to be made between the plaintife or plaintifes, and any person or persons, or any action, bill, or plaint of detinue of any goods or chattels where the plaintife or plaintifes shall suppose that the propertie belongeth to them or any of them, or any action, bill, or plaint of Accompt, in the which the plaintife or plaintifes suppose the defendant or defendants to be their Baylife, or Baylifes, receiuer or receiuers of their Manor, mease, money or goods to yeeld accompt, or any action, bill, or plaint vpon the case, or vpon any statute for any offence or wronge personall, immediatly supposed to be done to the plaintife or plaintifes, and the plaintife or plaintifes in any such kind of action, bil or plaint after appearance of the defenda^t or defendants be nonsuted, or that any verdict happen to passe by lawfull triall against the plaintife
 or plaintifes in any such action, bill, or plaint: that then the defendant or defendants in euerie such action, bill, or plaint, shall haue iudgement to recouer his costes against euerie such plaintife or plaintifes23. H. 8. c. 15. Rast. Dammages 6.. Likewise whereas as you say, that the partie plaintife ought to bee warie,6. Suite must not be maintained before an incompetent Iudge according to the common law least hee cause the defendant to appeare before an inco^petent Iudge, that agreeth fully with the common Lawe, for if a man doe sweare vnto me that hee will infeoffe mee of such land before such a day, if hee do not infeoffe me, I may not sue him in the Ecclesiasticall Court Pro laesione fidei, because the act which is to be done, is a temporall act and ought to be tried by the Common law, and therefore if the party be sued in the Ecclesiasticall Court for it, he may haue a prohibitionFitz. N.B. 43. D., so if a man deuise to one lands or tenements deuiseable, the deuisee may not sue for these landes in the Ecclesiasticall Court, but if he make a deuise of goods or chattels reall as of an estate for terme of yeares, or of a warde, for such he may sue in that Court,Fitz. 161. F. and if a trespasse bee done vpon the gleabe of a beneficed parson,7. The seuerall iurisdiction of diuerse cou ts i^ described. this must be tried at the Common law19.

E. 3.

Ad S.C.

This may suffice to infringe that which you haue deliuered, Codicgn. against informers. Now giue mee I pray you a little leaue to proue that informers are not onely tollerable in a well gouerned common weale,9 It is shewed likewise that informations are expedient for the administrati^^ of Iustice. but euen expedient and necessarie instrumentes for the good administration of Iustice: but alwaies I require in the^ honesty, faithfulnes, and co^science, taking this to bee an infallible rule, that he can neuer be a good informer, who is not a good man. These qualities being in the^, and truth being the grou^d of their proceeding, I see no reason but that their paines should be recompensed and rewarded, sometime with the 4. part, somtime the third, sometime the moity of the forfeiture, which the defendant by diuerse penal statutes is to forfeit and incur: for by reward the spirits of a ma^ are stirred vp and quickned: without it they linger, languish, and consume away, and why is reward due vnto such men? The causes and reasons be many, without information there wil be hardly any punishme^t inflicted vpo^ many offendors, and sithence nothing is more acceptable to God, or beneficiall to the common
 weale, then that offendours shoulde receiue their proper and co^digne punishment, al lawful meanes must be assaied to attaine to this effect, and what doth restrain men more fro^ committing offences then a continuall feare of the informers eie to be cast vpo^ them, or his eares to be ope^ for the harkning out of their offences: wherfore as the Hu^tsma^ doth bestow vpo^ his dogs some part of these beasts which he taketh and killeth in hunting, that by such inticements they may bee afterwarde drawne to pursue their pray fiercely and eagerly, so it behoueth a lawmaker diligently to hunt out the domestical lions and wolfes, and to allow some reward to the houndes of the Common weale, which informers arePlutar. in Lucul.: Conanus the king of Scots did make a law, that in euery great Church there should be a chest hauing some holes in the top, into which the informers might put in at pleasure their seuerall billes of information, wherein the fault committed, the place, the time, the witnesses and the parties accused were contained: then the Magistrate openeth the chest, bringeth the matter into question, and the guilty person being condemned the halfe part of the goods forfeited goeth to the informer: which Law is now put in practise, by them of MillaineBodin. li. 4. de repub. c. 6..

You haue spoken ynough of this matter Anglonomoph. I desire greatly to know, whether if a man do alleage some impediment happened by the act of God, whereby he could not appeare, this be a sufficient excuse of his default in Law.

Which is the most common actio^ in your Law Codicgnostes?


Codicgnost.
1. The most co^mon action in the Ciuill law is actio iniu^iaru^, which is either ciuilis or praetoria.The action which is called actio iniuriarum, which is either ciuilis, or praetoria: Ciuilis, if a man doe assault another, or doe beat him, or doe enter into his houseff. de iniur. l. lex Cornelia.: in all other cases it is praetoria. But both kindes agree in this, that the fault and iniurie is punishedInstit. de iniur. @ penult. and ff. de iniur. l. iniuriarum.. And in the pursuing of it a man may deale either ciuilly or criminally, but one of the wayes being chosen, the other may not be entred intoL. quod senatus. and l. praetor. @. 1. ff. de Iniurijs., and if the partie bring ciuile^ actionem iniuriaru^, he shall recouer the dammagesff.

This your speech tendeth to no other purpose as it seemeth, then to insinuate that such wrongs may be pursued by action or inditement,2. Actions and enditements at the Common law are compared with Ciuill and praetorian actions. wherein our Law doth not any whit disagree. For if foure men enter into land, and one of them entreth by force, this is force in them all, and they may be impleaded by action or impeached by inditement2. E. 3. 12. li. ass. 33. Cro^pt. I.P. 61.: but if a man enter by force where his entry is lawfull (so that there is no fault in the matter of his title, but in the manner of his entry onely) he shall not be punished by way of action, but by way of inditement15.

This is a very long and circumstantiall libell, and to my vnderstanding, many exceptions may be taken to it, which you shall giue me leaue for argument sake, and for my more vnderstanding, in order to pursue. First when you say in declaring the words,2. Exception is taken to the forme of the libell for vncertaintie. which are the original occasion of this action, that he spoke talia verba seu in effectu similia, me thinkes that should not be a good forme, for your libel being like to a declaration at the Co^mon Law, should be certaine, and without ambiguous or equiuocall tearmes: but of this matter I require the censure of Anglonomophylax.


Anglonomoph.
Your exception is good,3. The exception is approued by the common law. and maintenable by our Law: for in an action vpon the case brought for calling the plaintife false Iustice of Peace, vel his similia, these words his similia were ordered by the Court to be expunged or blotted out, by reason of the vncertaintie4. E. 6. Br. Action sur le case. 112..

Your libell likewise displeaseth me in another matter, because if I conceiue aright,4. Exception is likewise taken to the libell for mingling things of seuerall and diuers natures in it. you lay and alleage in your libell as the ground of your action things farre distant in nature, which it seemeth to me might very well beare two seuerall actions: for when as you say, that the defendant vttered these words (thou naughtie theefe, etc.) me thinkes, that of it selfe should beare action: and when you say further, that (in personam ipsius actoris irruit, and cum pugno
 pluribus ictibus ipsum actorem in faciem percussit, liuores and concussiones fecit) I thinke (vnder fauour) that these words of themselues require a seuerall and distinct action, and not such an action as lieth for vtterance of slanderous words.


Anglonomoph.
5. This exception likewise is main^ained by common law.Your opinion is good and sound in reason, and as for seuerall diseases there be diuers medicines, so for seuerall wrongs (I meane such as are different in nature) there should be seuerall Actions, lest the offering of these things ioyntly to the vnderstanding, which are different in substance, there arise a great confusion and disproportionable Chaos: Wherefore by our Law, if things of sundry natures be mingled in one action, and the action is good for the one and not for the other, in such case the writ shall abate as to that for which it was misconceiued: for example, in a writ of Trespas for breaking his close, and taking away certaine lambes, whereas the lambes were supposed to be tithe, and the close to be the Churchyard parcell of the Vicarage, brought by the Parson against the Vicar, it was held that the Court should be outed of iurisdiction as to the lambes, and the defendant should answere to the residue13. R. 2. Iurisdict. 19., and so in an action of Trespas brought against the Lord for breaking his close, and taking his horse vi and armis, it was ruled that the writ should abate for taking the horse, but not as to the breaking of the close:48. E. 3. 6. For the Lord cannot iustifie the hreaking of his tenants close,20. E. 4. 2. 7. R. 2. Briefe 6; 2. 8. H. 4. 16. 8. E. 4. 15. 10. E. 4. 7. So in an action of Trespasse for entering into a Warren brought by the
 tenant against the Lord of the soile, and for chasing there, and taking of conies the writ shall abate as to the entre into the warren vi and armis, and shal stand good for the remnant3. H. 6 13., and if it appeare by the writ or the declaratio^ that the action will not lie for some things mentioned in the writ, yet the writ may be in force for the remna^t, as in a writ of Wast, if a man assigne parcel of the wast in a thing which cannot properly bee said to bee wast, the writ notwithstanding shal not abate for the whole, and so a writ of Dower shall not abate for the whole, though the plaintife doe demaund Dower of something, whereof she is not endowable,9. H. 6. 10. 46 10. H. 6. 5. So in a writ of Accompt brought against one as Bailie, if the defendant pleade to parcell that he was lessee for yeares, and not Bailie, this shall abate the writ only for that parcell18. E. 3. 16., and 8. E. 4. in a writ of Entre brought vpon the statute of 5. of King Richard the second for entring into a Mannor and into an aduowson, because the action will not lie for the aduowson, it was held by Lakin, that the writ should abate for parcel,8. E. 4. 3. likewise in an action of Trespas brought by the husband and wife for a battery done to the^ both, after verdict found that both of them were beaten, the writ abated as to the battery of the husband, and as to the battery of the wife they recouered their damages,9. E. 4. 54. and it is said 11. E. 3. that a man may not alleage in a writ of Eiectment de gard, quod blada sua apud B. nuper cresce^tia messuit, and blada and alia bona etc. cepit, because proclamation lieth for the one, but not for the other,11. E. 3. 471. but
 a man may haue a writ of Detinue of Charters and of Chattels iointly,44. E. 3. 41. Briefe 583. because there one thing is the ground of the action, namely the deteiner, and so a man may haue a writ of Det, where parcell of the debt is due by obligation, and parcell by contract, because there the debt is the onely occasion of suit,41. E. 3. Damag. 75. 1. H. 5. 4. and so in things of the like nature one writ may comprehend many wrongs, and therfore an action vpon the case was maintained for the hindering of the plaintife to hold his Leete, for the disturbance of his seruants and tenants in the gathering of his tithe, and for threatning made, so that the people etc. durst not come to a certaine Chappell to doe their deuotion, and to present their offerings, and for the takeing of his seruants and chattels, but in Adamses case it was ruled, that whereas an action vpon the case was brought for speaking these words (you haue made a false record, I will make you answere where you dare not shew your face, and you haue sought my death) the defendant as to the falsifying of the record iustified, because he did make a misentrie once into a rolle in a Court where hee was Steward, and as to the rest he pleaded non Culpable, and hee was found guiltie of the whole, and dammages were assessed to twenty pounds, and it was mooued for stay of Iudgement, that some of the words would not beare action, as namely to say (that hee sought his death) because that may bee by due meanes in Law: nor the other words (that hee would make him answere where hee durst
 not shew his face) wherefore because no action will lie for part of the matter alleaged, the assessement of the damages for the whole is not good, and therefore iudgement ought not to be giuen: to which it was answered that when words are spoken to the disgrace of a man, they cannot be otherwise vnderstood then in malam partem, and therefore to say to one that he hath beene laied of the pockes, is to be intended of the French pockes, and though action will not lie for some of the words which were vttered, yet it must be intended that damages were assessed for these words which are of effect to beare action: and this case hath beene adiudged that one called another very villaine and strong theefe, the defendant pleaded non culpable, and he was found guiltie to the damages of xl.li. though action doe not lie for the words very villaine, yet iudgement was giuen that the plaintife should recouer the intire damages: and so was iudgement giuen in the principall case25. Elizab. Adamses case..

Well no more of this:6. Another exception is taken for superfluous alleaging of the day and houre of the trespasse done. giue me leaue further to obiect; what need you say in your libel die decimo nono Augusti proxime praeteriti? for it is not materiall when a wrong is done, but mee thinkes it should suffice to alleadge that it was done, and therefore much lesse need you haue said hora tertia vel circa: againe, me thinkes your libell is too prolixe in setting downe the words and circumstances of the iniurie: and likewise you haue vsed too many words in describing the assault and batterie, which might haue beene
 briefly expressed by these wordes insultum in eum fecit and eum verberauit, neither doe I see the vse of these words pacifice conseruando,8 Exeption is take^ for saying nemini in iurtam inferendo. neminique iniuriam inferendo: For what if Titius the plaintife had beene fighting, with Seius a straunger, is it therefore lawfull for Sempronius the defendaunt in this case to assault and beat Titius? and what need (you say in your libel) animo iniurioso:9 Exceptio is likewise taken for vsing these wordes animo iniurioso being taken for a surplusage. for no wrong can bee done without an iniurious meaning, and the secret meaning must needs appeare by the open description of the wrong.

 then the defendaunt,Glo. in l. ob. haec verba ff. de his qui no. inf. and in l. 1. @. cum arietes ff. si quadrup. paup. fec. and he cannot he said to haue done a wrong, who incontinently for his safegard after the same maner, whereby hee is assaulted doth defend himselfe, for when a man is assaulted by weapons, he may resist with weapons,l. vt vim. ff de inst. and iure l. si quis percussor. C. ad leg. Cor. de sicar. but if he do exceed measure in repealing iniury, as if being vexed with wordes hee resist with weapons, and by such resistance do beate or wound the partie, he that is so grieued may haue an action of iniury against him,l. sententiam @. qui cum aliter. ff. ad l. Aquil. and recouer damages:l. item apud La beone^. @. fi quis seruo ff. de iniur. and to prescribe some temper and moderation in the resisting of verbal and actuall iniuries, I reme^ber a verse not altogether vnpleasant:
Res dare pro rebus, pro verbis verba solemus,Pro bufis bufas, pro trufis reddere trufas:Things must be recompenced with things. buffets with blowes:And wordes with wordes, and taunts with mockes, and mowes. And to conclude, you seeme not (with your favour bee it spoken) iustly to reproue these words animo iniurioso, for they are expressed for differe^ce sake, because if a man in iestingwise should strike an other or vse broad boward against him, this would not beare an action, because it was not done animoni iuria^di, sed iocandi:l. illud peraeque. ff. de iniur. and l. fi non conuicij C. c^d thus I think you are sufficiently quieted in opinion as to the doubts which you proposed.


Nomomat.
Nay verily I rest as yet doubtfull, and for the fuller clearing of my mind, I would haue Anglonomoph. to speake somewhat of these things out of the common Law, which in matters
 of declaration and pleading is very curious and exquisite.


Anglonomoph.
11 Anglo. particularly examineth and discusseth the exceptions.Truth and error are both equally beholding vnto you, for in some things by the censure of our Lawe one of you hath the vpper hand, in other some the other: for proofe hereof I will by your patience particularly handle euery of the foresaid obiections, which hath in it any colour of truth, as to the day of the moneth wherein the wrong is supposed to be done, I do not with Codicgn. think that in this case the very day necessarily ought to haue beene mentioned, because it is not trauersable nor material to make any issue, but it is sufficient (for obseruing formality) to set downe any day that is past.


Codicgn.
But with vs it is material, and if the day be not truly set downe, the defendant may take aduantage of it.


Anglonomo.
With vs it is not so, for as Newton saith 20. H. 6. the day in an action of Trespas and repleuin are not trauersable, for if the defendant iustifie at an other day after, he ought to say without that he tooke them before,20. H. 6. 40. per New. and so 19. H. 6. in a trespas of battery the def. said that the plaintife did assault him at another time, then he hath declared, and that the hurt which was done vnto him came of his own wro^g, sa^s ceo that hee was Culpre before or after, and this ple he was e^forced to pled by the court,19. H. 6. 47. yet in some case the day and time for auoiding vncertainty, and that the Iury may more easily find out the truth is issuable, and therefore in an action of trespas supposing a batterie,
 the defendant said, that the same day, wherein the trespas was supposed, the plaintif and the defendant by common accord did playe together at cudgels, and the hurt which hee did vnto him was by that play, without that, that hee hurt him in any other maner, iudgme^t si actio^: To which the plaintife replyed, that the same day when they were departed, the defendaunt came vnto him and assaulted him, and beat him of his owne wrong, and the defendaunt reioyned that all the day and at euery time of the day by their common accord they played together, without that that he beate him in other manner,12. R. 2. Barr^ 244. And so in a repleuin of his beastes wrongfully taken, the first day of August the defendaunt auowed, because the plaintife helde the lande etc. of him by homage and fealty and suite at his Court at such a place, and because hee was summoned to bee at his Courte the fifth daie of the said moneth and yeare, and did not come he was amerced, and for the said amerciament hee tooke the beastes the twentith day of August, without that, that he tooke them the first day of August, and it was sayd by Markeham that this was no plea: for if you took the^ at an other day before the presentment it is wrongful, wherefore you ought to say without that that you tooke the beastes before the twentith day: but issue was in this case taken, without that hee tooke them the first day of August,20. H. 6. 40. whereupon Master Fitzherbert noteth, that the day in a writ of Trespasse or Repleuin is not trauersable, but where the speciall matter
 doth require it,Fitz. Repl. 7. and this hee seemeth to ground vpon 2. H. 4. likewise in an action of trespas for the taking of goods the 8. day of Aprill the def. said that the plaintife was possessed of them as his proper goods and chattels, and sold them to such a one who left them in the custodie of the plaintife, and after hee solde them to the defendant, wherefore hee tooke them at the time supposed, to which the plaintife replyed, that he was possessed of them vntill the defend. tooke them the 8. day of April as before hath been alleaged, sans ceo that the other solde them to the defendant before that day, and hereupon they were at issue.2. E. 4. 16. b


Nomomat.
Well let this matter passe, what say you to the multitude of wordes vsed in the description of the wrong? is that tollerable in your Law?


Anglonomoph.
12 Anglo. Excuseth and defende^h the abund^nce of words in declarations and libels.Surely it is conuenient that the qualitie of euery thing should be apparanted by termes of efficacie, and it is better to haue a declaration too copious then carion-leane, neither is any thing more plausible to a good vndersta^ding, then that words be ponderous and emphaticall, where the matter seemeth to bleed, wherefore Virgil in describing the loftie pace of the lusty and couragious horses, maketh his verse after a sort to gallop, and doth in liuely terms as it were present it to the eye,
Quadrupedante putrem cursu quatit vngula campu^. And Persius decently maketh his verse to rise and swell with the matter.
Torua Mimalloneis inflarunt cornua bombis.
But not to digresse from our purpose, in an appeale of mayhem, the wrong must bee in this forme, or the like set downe. Ioh. Nan propria persona sua hic instanter appellat W.G. de eo, qd cum ide^ querens tali die and anno fuit in pace dei et dominae Reginae nunc apud talem villam in tali comitatu circa horam sextam etc. ibi venit predictus W. vi and armis viz. baculis vt felo, insidiando, and ex insultu premeditato adtunc and ibid' in dict'I. insultum fecit and adtunc and ibid' cu^ quodam baculo precij etc. quem praedictus W. adtunc and ibid' in manibus suis tenuit praedictum querente^ super brachiu^ dextru^ felonice tunc percussit. per qd venae and nerui bracij sui praedicti restricti fuerunt ac sicci mortificati deuenerunt etc.Lib. de diuersit des Courts 115. Here you haue the Mayhem described from the beginning to the end in full termes: and yet euery of them, or at least almost all, so necessary, that if you take away one of these flowers ye mar the whole garland, and so in a writ of trespas for the hurting of his sheepe (though briefes bee shorte comprehensions of things) the wrong is fully set downe in this sort, Quare vi and armis centum oues ipsius A. apud T. inuentas cu^ quibusdam canibus fugauit, canes illos ad mordendum oues praedict as in ta^tum incitando quod per fugationem illam and morsus canum praedictarum oues praedictae multipliciter deterioratae fuerunt and magna pars ouium illarum fetus abortiuos fecit.Fit. n. b. 89. I.


Nomomath.
Well what say you to these words (animo iniurioso) whether are they needles or not


Anglonomoph.
These words carie sence in their
 foreheads: for they amount to as much as malitiose in our law and that ought to be set downe to distinguish it from iocose as Codicgnostes hath before verie well reasoned: and when the action soundeth to malice, the word malitiose or the like in substance is to be vsed, as well as when the action soundeth to disceit, the word fraudulenter or some equiuolent terme is of necessity to bee expressed.


Nomom.
Of these matters then I know what to think, and wil moue no other doubt or question of them: Now Anglonomophylax, because I think at the common law an action vpon the case co^ceiued vpon a slaunder doth most resemble this action of iniury before described, let me therfore know the forme of the declaration, which is fit for that action.


Anglonom.
13 The forme of a declaratio^ vpon an action vpon the case resembling actione^ iniuriarum.You haue conceiued in this a right opinion, and I will roundly shew vnto you the forme of the declaration whereof you spake, because it is verie plaine and much in vse, it is thus: W.C. queritur de P. L. in custodia Marr. pro eo viz. quod cum praedictus W. bonorum mominis ac fame ac honestarum conuersationis, gesture, and conditionis fuerit and vt verus ligeus dom. Reginae nunc, absque ^llo scandalo ac sine quacunque macula latrocinij, furti, falsitatis, vel cuiusuis alij criminis ac sine vllo scandalo earunde^ macular', and ab omnibus huiusmodi fallacijs dolis, et malis illesus, intact', et immaculatus a te^pore natiuitat' sue hucusque se gesserit, habuer' et gubernauer' et huiusm' stat', conuers. et honest' apud vicin' suos et vniu^s. fidel' dom. reg. nu^c subdit' quib. id.

These two proceedings doe little differ in substance, and there is in them me thinketh great redundancie of wordes, which might wel be spared, but tel me I pray you is there such necessity of these formall termes, that if they be wanting or changed, the declaration, or proceeding shall abate?



Codicgn.
14 The cutting off of delaies by the Ciuill Law.Surely, because the tedious and odious protracting of suits did greatly offend iustice therefore to cut off delaies, and that suits might not be endles, and immortal (for matters of forme and the exceptions to them were grown to such an excessiue heape and infinite number, that the whole age of man did scarcely suffice for the triall of one suit, and he that failed in a sillable failed in the cause) our lawmakers therfore, that Iustice might walke in a shorter and more compendious way, did therefore verie willingly roote vp the thornie groue of cauilles, and sophisticall wranglings, which had mingled themselues with good and reasonable exceptions, and scouring the streame of such weedes and sedges, they haue now made a smooth and more easie passage for IusticeIn rubr: and nigr: C. de form: and impetrat: action: Iublat:.


Anglon.
1^ The diminishing of dela^es by the Common law.Vpon like consideration and to the verry same purpose our lawmakers haue made laws for amendement of writs, declarations, and other proceedings in matters of form, as may appeare by seuerall Statutes made for the establishing of such amendments, as namely 14. E. 3. c. 6. 9. H. 5. c. 4. 4. H. 6. c. 3. 8. H. 6. c. 12. and 15. 32. H. 8. c. 30. 18. El. c. 14. 27. El. c. 5. and by the equity and direct meaning of these Statutes, diuers amendements haue bin made and vsed in our law: and therfore in an action of debt grounded vpon a recouerie of damages had in an assise, the date of the writ of Assise was not put in the Writ of debt, and it was held that it should be amended, because the Clerke had the recorde for his instruction,13. H. 7. 21. but
 whereas a writte of debt was brought per Iohannem Gargraue Esquire, and the obligation was Ioan Gargraue onely, this was not amended, but abated, because this misprision came of the plaintifes part, Quere tamen, but 8. E. 4. and 11. E. 4. if in an actio^ of det the Clarke of the Chancerie haue the obligation with him at the time of the making of the writte, and there bee variance betweene the writte and the obligation, it is clerely amendable, but if no addition bee giuen to the defendant, that is not amendable,8. E. 4. 4 11. E. 4. 2. and 22 Ed. 4. if an action of debt bee brought against executors of the debt of the testator, if the writte be in the Debet and Detinet, it is not amendable,22. E. 4. 21. per Cur. and in a writte of Audita querela the surname of the defendant was Langawaite, and in the Indenture of Defeafance his name was Langwaite without the letter (a) in the middest, whereuppon the writte was amended by statute, because that was not of the substance of the name, or surname; and also it was to bee intended that the Clarke had the Indenture of Defeasance at the time of the making of the writte,21. H. 6. 8. and so in an action of debt, where the writte was Hille, and the Obligation was Hulle, the writte was amended,22. H. 6. Amendme^t 31 37. H. 6. 32. and where more was in the Obligation then in the writte, it was amended,19. H. 6. Amendme^t 47 but 41. E. 3. it is held by Finch. that a writte originall shall abate for default of forme, and shall not bee amended in the Courtes of common Lawe, for though it be pleadable there, yet (as Master Statham reasoneth) the Chauncerie is an other
 Court, and a superiour Court:Stath. tit. Amend 20. H. 6. and therefore the things done there ca^not be altered in Courts of common Law,41. E. 3. 14. per Finch. 9. H. 7. 16. per Vauis. and 22. E. 4. 20. and for the more ful and forcible destruction of delayes and ambushes in pleading, it is by the common Lawe ruled, that euery demurrer vpon a plea which goeth in barre, and to the disproofe of the Title is peremptory: and thoughe a plea in Abatement of a writte be not peremptory, but a respondeat vlterius, yet if the plea in Abatement of a writte be tryed by the Countrie, that is doubtlesse peremptory for the delay of the party,48. E. 3. 10. per Finch. 34. H. 6. 8. 50. E. 3. 20. 34. H. 6. 37. But it is peremptorie onely against the tenant or defendant, not against the plaintife or demaundant, for he is still at large.5. E. 4. 90. 2. E. 4. 10

Let mee interrupt you Anglonomoph. for I doe verie much desire to heare of you and Codicgnostes, the fourmes of the defences or barres, which the defendants are to make against these declarations, before recited by you.


Codicgn.
I will make knowne vnto you the most common and vsuall forme of pleading in barre in this case.16 The forme of a defence or barre in an action of iniuries Vt vobis clarissimo magnifico etc. constet and legitime appareat de innocentijs, inculpabilitatibus, legitimisque defensionibus predicti Sempronij delati, preuenti, seu inquisiti, ipsumque ad malam, iniustam, dolosam, and iniquam nonnullorum suorum maleuolorum and inimicorum dolatione^, instigationem, seu denunciationem fuisse preuentum, and in processu inuolutu^, et per vos vestramque definitiua^ sententia^ dictus etc. delatus, seu preuentus, seu inquisit'

Item dicit and ponit, quod dictus intitulatus and preuentus vestigia dictorum parentum suorum insequens, toto tempore vitae suae, fuit and est catholicus, legalis, probus, honestus, absque eo and praeter id, quod Titius praedictus querens, de eodem intitulato seu praeuento aliqua laborauerit infamia, sinistra suspicione, aut mala fama. Item and quod semper pacifice, and quiete inter omnes se habuit and conuersatus fuit omnibus prodessendo, and neminem ledendo seu offendendo. Item negat se dictum Titium pulsasse, verberasse and ei vel cuiquam alteri via facti, seu dicti, seu alias nocuisse, and vulnera, liuores, vel concussiones intulisse, Ex quibus apparet dictum intitulatum seu praeuentum fuisse and esse a sibi impositis innocentem and minime culpabilem, indebiteque and iniuste intitulatum and preuentum, and in processu inuolutum fuisse, and per consequentiam in via absolutionis and relaxationis fore and esse.

Well ye haue bin long in ha^dling these matters of formal proceeding, wherefore I will aske you of this, but one question more, and then will passe ouer to intreate somewhat of co^mon trespasses and wrongs, resolue me first in this, whether may the executor of the testator that  was wro^ged by such diffamatorie speeches, haue an action for the said slaunder after the death of the testator?


Codicgn.
It neither lieth for the executor of him that is slau^dered,1 That by the Ciuill Lawe an action of iniuries wil not be by executor against exec^tor. nor against the executor of him that did slau^der, because noxa caput sequitur, vnlesse the suit were begu^ne in the life of the testator, in which case the executor may well prosecute itInst. de iniur^ @ non omnes and @ pena^es ff. de iniur^ l. iniuriarum..1 That by the Common law actio personalit mortiur cum persona, vnlesse it be in some speciall cases.

It is a rule with vs that actio personalis moritur cu^ persona: yet this is not generally
 and indefinitely to be admitted, but only in such case, where the wro^g did principally and immediatly rest vpo^ a mans person, and whe^ (as the Ciuilians say) it is ita affixa ossibus vt in aliu^ tra^sferri non possitff. de pecu. l. si quis ergo..

1 The diuerse kinds of iniuries by the Ciuill law.Iniurie as we say is two folde, for either it is done re or verbis: re, when a man is assaulted
 or beaten: verbis, when a man is slandered and by termes disgraced or discreditedL. 1. ff. de iniurijs..


Nomom.
I pray you Anglonomoph. illustrate and explaine the members of this diuision by some conuenient cases.


Anglon.
Verie willingly,2 What an assault is according to the Comman Law and to begin with the first: an assault is made when one man menaceth an other with a weapon or staffe, though neuer a blow be stroken, yet this is an assault22. Ass. pl. 60, and 43. E. 3. the Writ was Quare insultum fecit vulnerauit verberauit and maihemauit, and it was allowed though the wronge did sound to bee maihem43. Ass. 39., and as it was held per Curiam, where a man maketh an assault it is not lawfull for any to beate him, if the party assaulted may escape with his life2. H. 4. 8., yet the opinion of M. Brooke is that hee may beate him if hee cannot otherwise escape without stripes or wounds or maymingBr^ Trespas 71., yet the opinion of 9. E. 4. is, that I may beate a man if he will take my goods from me: and a seruant may iustifie a battery in the defence of his master9. E. 4. 28. and 48., but the assembling of people in a warlike manner is no assault, but hee that is the ringleader of such assemblies, before he may be impeached of assault must doe something else, as namely by vttering contumelious speeches, or stretching out his armes, or some other token whereby his intent may be knowen17. E. 4. 4., and he that commeth in company of them that make the assault, or he which commeth to aide them, is a principal trespassor22. Ass. pl. 43, and if a Iustice of Peace see a man doing an assault, he may presently arrest him by commaundement
 or word, to the intent that he may finde surety of the peace9. E. 4. 3., and it is lawfull for one man to beate an other in defence of his goods and chattels, or of his wife19. H. 6. 31 35. H. 6. 51. and a man may likewise haue an action of trespas for the entring into his houseFit. N. b. 88. l., but if a man licence one to come into his house, and he doth a trespas there, he shall be punished for the trespas but not for the entre which was graunted vnto him3. H. 7. 15. Townes., and nothing is more vsuall then a man to bring an action vpon the case for a slaunder,1 That the Comman Law giueth an actio^ vpon the case for a slaunder. and therefore if one man call an other bankerupt, an action vpon the case will lye6. E. 6. 72. Dy., or if one say to an other that he is infected of the robbery and murder lately committed and smels of the murder, an action vpon the case will lye for these wordes15. Eliz. 317 Dy., and the Duke of Buckingham brought an action de scandalis magnatum against one Lucas, because he said that the said Duke had no more conscience then a dog, and so he had goods hee cared not how he came by them4. H. 8. rotul. 659., infinite other cases might be brought tending to this purpose.

I will trouble you no further herein but tell mee Codicgnostes, whether by your Law may the hushand haue an action for the wrong done to his wife, the father for a wrong done to his sonne, and the master for an iniurie done to his seruant?1 That by the Ciuill law an action o^ trespas lieth by the father, husband, master, for a wrong don to the son, wife, seruant.

To that our law accordeth: and
 first to shew,2 That by the Common law the husband may haue an action for a wrong done to his wife. that the husband may haue an action for a wrong done to his wife, it seemeth that these words: and eam cum bonis and catallis praedicti A.

K, that the suit for the taking of the woman onely, without mentioning any other thing in the Writ, is maintenable at the Common law, howbeit he putteth this case, that if a man sue in Court Christian for the taking and deteyning of his wife, which was lawfully maried to him, if the other sue a prohibition hereupon, he may haue a consultation quatenus pro restitutione vxoris suae duntaxat prosequiturFitz. ibidem, and if the woman doe lye asunder from her husband the suit will lye in the Spirituall court to haue againe the fellowship of marriage and to dwell together as may appeare by these words of the StatutD. Cofins in li. de iurisdict. ecclesiastic.: (vnlesse he will receiue her without ecclesiastical compulsion13. E. 1. c. 34. West. 2.) but where a man bringeth an action at the common Law de muliere abducta cum bonis viri: he must be sure that his wife hath atteyned to age of consent and that she hath actually consented to the marriage: for where a man marieth a wife before she be of the age of 12. yeres, and after she cometh to the age of 12. yeeres, and before she assent or disassent one taketh or carieth her away, the husband in this case cannot haue a Writ of trespas cum muliere
 abducta cum bonis viri by some authority, because it is not properly a mariage till she assent47. E. 3. Br. Trespas 420: yet M. Brooke doubteth hereof, and rather thinketh vpon very good reason the contrary, because it shall be intended a good mariage vntill the woman do disassentBrooke ibid.: but where the mariage is complete and without all daunger of contradiction, though the wife be dead or diuorced at the time of the action brought, yet the action is maintenable for the husba^d43. E. 3. 22., but the word (rapuit) must bee in the Writ as well as the word (abduxit) and therefore it will not ly against a woman, because one woman cannot rauish an other43. E. 3. 23, and if a man doe carrie away a woman by the licence of her husband,3 In what cases by the common law an act^on wil ly for the master for a wrong done to his seruant. this Writ will not lye1. E. 4. 1., for it is vi and armis, and as to the bringing of an actio^ by the mast. for some hurt don to his seruant, it is frequent in our bookes: for by the beating, or maiming or wounding of the seruant, the master hath the loss of his seruice:3. H. 6. 53. and therfore if any ma^ take the seruant of an other man out of his seruice, an action of trespas wil ly against him that taketh him39. E. 3. 38. Fit. n. b. 91. I. 21. H. 6. 31., but if a ma^ find an other ma^s serua^t wa^dring abroad and reteyne him, this is lawful, if he knew nothing of the first reteyner. But though by the common Law an action of trespas quare vi et armis did lie against him that tooke an other mans seruant out of his seruice: yet if he did only procure him to go out of seruice, and then reteined him, the master could haue had by the Common Law no action, but only an action vpon the case, but now by parliament an actio^ is giue^ vpon the statut of
 labourers11. H. 4. 23. Br^ Trespas 92.: Lastly it is plain by our Law,4 In what cases by the common Law an action will lie for the father for a wrong don to the son. that the father may haue an action for the taking away of his son and heire, but in the Writ he must say cuius maritagium ad ipsum pertinet: for this Writ is giuen vnto the father, because the mariage of his son and heire, or of his daughter and heire doth of right appertaine vnto him, and if the father haue maried his heire before, so that he hath once enioyed the fruite and benefite of the marriage, which the Law allotted vnto him, hee shall not haue this Writ12 H. 4. 16. 8.

I will require no more at your hands Anglonomoph. of this matter, now I pray you Codicgnostes resolue me in this, whether whe^ any mans beasts do any hurt vnto an other man, if this be not done by the owners acte, default, or procurement, shall the master make good the dammage susteined by such wrong.


Codicgn.
1 How the owner shall be punished by the Ciuill Law for a trespas done by his beasts.Surely brute beastes, because they want vnderstanding and reason, cannot bee said properly to bind their owner (noxaliter, so that the fault should be accompted his) for any rauin hurt, or dammage whatsoeuer, neither doe such wrongs bind the owner of the beasts ex quasi delicto, for a matter like vnto a wrong: yet notwithstanding for preuenting of hurt, that may in such sort happe^, the law doth prouide, that if the owner wil not voluntarily yeeld vp the beast as a recompence to him that is enda^maged, he must re^der the da^mages, or els by the authoritie of the iudge bee awarded and compelled to yeeld vp the beastL. 1. ff. si quadru: paup: fec: dic., and thefore if any man do keepe or nourish a Mastife, or Boare, or Foxe, or Beare, or Lio^ or Wolfe, or some like beast which doth hurt or damnifie an other ma^, he that receiueth the hurt shall recouer da^mages against the owner of the beast@ Caeterum Instit. si quadru: pauperie^ fecisse dicatur., but if such a beast do escape away fro^ me,2 In what, case he shal not be punished though his beasts doe hurt to an other man. or goeth so farre from my pasture or warde that I cannot by pursuing recouer it, neither doe I know whether it is fledde, and so being escaped from me it doe hurt an other man, in this case I am not to susteyne any dammage, because in this case, I am free from fault: for the beast by
 such escape ceaseth to be mine, and may become his that shall take, or seise, or kill it.d. l. 1. @ in bestijs and @ Caeteru^, versic. Deniq^, si vrsus


Anglon.
To this our Law agreeth, for we haue a Writ of trespas which saith, Quare vi and armis centum oues ipsius A. cum quibusdam canibus fugauit canes illos ad mordendum oues praedict as in tantu^ incitando qd per fugationem illam and morsus canum praedictorum oues praedictae multipliciter deterioratae fuerunt and magna pars ouium illarum faetus abortiuos fecit etc. per qd etc.Fit. n. b. 89. L But if a Dogge doe kill or hurt any mans beasts,3 That by the Common law a man shall be punished for a trespas don by his beasts. the master being ignorant of his mischieuous property, hee is not punishable28. H. 8. 25 Dy. and 29. Dy., wherby I gather that if he know of his propertie (though hee doe not set on his dogge or mainteine him to doe hurt to others) he shall bee punished by action of trespas, and if a man doe driue his beasts through the Queenes high-way, to which way my land that is sowne with Corne is adioyning, and the beasts doe enter and spoile my Corne, the owner shall be punished for this, though hee did driue them out presently, or earnestly endeuor to chase them out of the Corne10. E. 4. 7., so if a man chase his beasts in the high way, and they doe escape into land, which is not inclosed and the owner doth freshly pursue them, and chaseth them out, yet this is no good plea in barre without shewing that the tenaunt of the lande, and all those whose estate hee hath in the lande, haue vsed to inclose the said land toward the high way15. H. 7. 17.


Nomomath.
I craue no more of this matter: now I would haue you to transfer your inuention
 to the discourse of other offences against the peace, which I doe thus dispose and distribute to your handling: because all offences against the peace are either in an inferior degree, as these whereof yee haue lastly spoken, or in a middle degree, as vnlawfull assemblies, riots, routes, and forcible entres, or in a higher degree, and they be of three sorts, namely such as bee committed against the dignitie of man, as treason and rebellion: or against the life of man, as murder, manslaughter, and homicide by chaunce: or against the good estate of man, as theft, burglarie, and robberie: I would therefore haue you first to begin to treate of vnlawfull assemblies, riots, etc. and then to goe on with the rest, accordingly as I haue set them down.

Tell me Codicgn. what doe you take to be publike force in your Law?



Cdicgn.
When an vnlawfull assembly is mette together in the high streete,1 The description of publike force by the Ciuill law. or in the open sight of men, to offer abuse, hurt, or iniurie to a mans person, or to take away his goods from him by violence and strength of hand.L. armatos. ff. ad L.

Anglonomop.
That likewise is publike force by our Law:2 That in the matter of publike force the Common law agreeth with the Ciuill. of priuate force done to a mans person we haue spoken before, which if it bee publikely done, it turneth to be publike force, but as to the taking away of goods by open force, if a man do disseisie an other, and when he hath entred, he doth carie away the chattels of the disseisie, this is in our Law a disseisin with force and armes,3 A difference by the common Law betwixt publike force and open force. and the disseisor shal be punished by imprisonment11. H. 4. 16. West. 1. c. 37 4. H. 4. c. 8., and a man disseised an other but not with force at his first entre, and it was found by assise that incontinent after his first entre, he cut down trees and this was awarded a disseisin with force and armes.30.

What punishment haue they by your Lawes which commit such force?


Codicgn.
The punishment of this fault in our Law,4 The punishment of publik force by the Ciuill Law is diuersifyed by the qualitie of the persons that commit it: for otherwise bondme^, otherwise they that are free, are punished: and if it be mixed with an other fault, it was punished in a free man by ancient Lawes, with perpetuall banishment, and the confiscation of goodsL. 2. ff. de publ. iudic. and l. fi quis ad se fundun. C. eod. and @ item lex Inst. eod., but now it is punished with bannishment for a certeyne time without confiscation of goods@ relegat. Inst. quib. mod. ius pat. potest. soluit., but it is to bee noted that the said punishment only taketh place when force is actually done or committed,
 but if nothing be done forcibly, but certein men hauing weapons are assembled in a great multitude together to commit force, the punishment of that offence is arbitrarie and lefte to the discretion of the Iudge, but the Law setteth downe this mulct in certein, that if he be a man of worth hee shall pay to the common treasurie, an hundred pounds in gold, whosoeuer in such sort offendeth.L. ff.

Anglonomophilax,
5 That by the Comman Law the counsellors and committors of force are alike punishedBy our Law if a disseisin be found to be done by diuers men, and to be done by force, and one of them is found to bee but a counsellor of the disseisin, yet euerie of them shall be awarded to prison17. Ass. pl. 14, and if a man be atteynted of trespass at the suit of the partie, or of a disseisin with force, wherefore he is commaunded to prison, if he be present, or that he shall be attached, if he be absent, whereupon he is attached and put in prison at the Kings suit, vntill he haue payd a fine to the King, and after he findeth pledges for his fine, and prayeth that he may bee at large, he shall not be permitted to goe at large, vntill the Court be sufficiently enformed that be hath agreed with the partie, if the plaintife doe require before that his body may continue in prison, vntill the defendaunt haue agreed with him22.

 more then two doe assemble together to the intent to doe an vnlawfull acte,7 What a riot is. as to beate or to maime an other, and they doe this in fact: but if diuers assemble, and none know to what intent, this is not punishable till the intent be knowneFitz.

But what if the Magistrates in the  Countrey be negligent and remisse in punishing such offences, hath nor your Lawe Codicgnostes prouided reformation for them.


Codicgn.
Yes,1 The punishment of the Iustice not punishing such offences by the Ciuill Law. if any Iudge will not doe Iustice in the repressing and punishing of such offendors but shall either defer the punishment, or neglect to giue sentence, or shall partially demeane himselfe in the smothering of that fault, or shall not inflict the punishment due to such offences, the said Magistrate is by Law to be made infamous, to be depriued of his office, and to be made vncapable and vnable for any other office, and further he is to be fined a C. li. in gold.m



Anglonomophylax,
2 That the Iust. of Peace by the Common law are punished for remisnes of punishing others, for the aforesaid faultsOur Law is likewise seuere against such: for if the Iustices of Peace, and Sherife, or vnder-Sherife doe record the force, and doe not commit the riotors to prison, or if they commit them, and do not record the force, they shall pay euerie of them a C. li. for the Statute is, that they shall record and commit13. H. 4. c. 7., and if any riots, routs, or assemblies of people be done against the Law, two Iustices of Peace at the least with the Sherife or vnder-Sherife must go to the place where the riot, etc. is committed, and they must take the offendors etc. and this is by the Statute of 13. H. 4. cap. 7. but notwithstanding this Statute Fineux chiefe Iustice, was of opinion 14. H. 7. that forsomuch as the Statut is but merely in the affirmatiue, that therefore one Iustice of Peace may goe and take power with him, and represse the riotors etc. and hee needeth not to stay for his companions, nor for the Sheriffe, nor etc. because the Statute is a beneficiall Law made to auoid a mischiefe which might otherwise happen if one Iustice should stay for his companions14.

Henr. 4. they shall euery of them paie an hu^dred pou^d, as before I haue said and the other Iustices of the same countie, where
 the riot is committed shall be fined for the not repressing of the riot, if there be any default in them23. Eliz. Crom. Iu.

The thirteenth Dialogue of Treason and Rebellion.

NOmomat.
Let me know Codicgnostes  before we enter into particuler in quirie of the things which are in themselues, and ipso facto treason, what in auntient times, and other Common weales, hath been taken to be treason, and how hath it been punished, for I thinke that will giue great light to matters subsequent, because that which is past was the originall of that which is present, and it is good in matters of common weale to haue a diligent retrospect to the course of former ages.


Codicgnost.
It is true,1 The reason is shewed by Codicgnostes wherfore treason is aptly tearmed a fault ^gainst the dignitie of man. and first I will shew how aptly you haue termed this offence to be a crime or fault against the dignity of man: for as nothing should more debase mans nature, then if against man, whom God hath made little inferiour
 to the Angels, whom he hath crowned with glory and worship, whom he hath made Lord of the workes of his hands, and hath put all thinges vnder his feet:Psal. 8. ver. 6.7.8.9. If I say against him the beasts of the field should rage and rebel, as it happened in Rome, when as a preamble of the fatall confusion of that City, all the beasts subiect and necessary to mans vse, namely dogges, horses, asses, oxen, etc. would not suffer their masters to touch them or come neere them, without destruction and perill:Oros. lib. 5. Iul Obsequens in lib. de prod. D. August. li. 3. de ciuit. dei ca. 23. so surely when they, who are in subiection to a Prince or Monarche, doe violently and mutinously breake the bond of obedience and loyalty, and will doe as they list, and thereupon rebell, and treacherously conspire against the life of their Prince, this is against the dignitie of man, who being Lord of brutish creatures, doth imitate them, and becommeth as wild and sauage and disobedient as they. Now I will call to remembrance, how this disloyalty or treacherie in the highest degree, hath in other ages receiued censure and punishment.2 The punishment of treaso^ in antient times. Traytors were alwaies lothed, detested; and sharpely punished of the Romanes: and treason was accompted farre more greeuous then paricide,Dionis. Halicarnass. tit. 2. and 8 sometime they were throwne headlong downe a rocke, as Cassius: sometime hanged, as Lentulus and others of Catalines seditious societie, or by some speciall kind of infamous death executed, as Suetonius reporteth,Sueton. in Neron. c. 49. and they which conspired against Augustus, when he was newly come to the Empire, bore the smart of their treacherous designments,
 and were seuerely punished for the imagination of that heinous mischiefe.Dio. Nicae. in August. This Iustice of the heathens is iustified by diuine authoritie. Non mittam manum meam in vnctum domini.1. Reg. c. 24. Quare non timuisti mittere manu^ tuam vt occideres vnctu^ domini:2. Reg. c. 1. for surely the maiesty of a prince offended and hurt, doth require a deepe reuenge: and if Nemesis, that is reuenge it selfe, doth take sharpe punishment of those which offer any violence to the person of an Embassador,Appian. in select. representing a Prince or Monarche; with what extremity of paine are they to be tortured, which imagin or goe about to compas the death and downfall of their liege and dread Soueraigne: Wherfore worthily doth the excellent Lawyer out of Code apply these titles of Maiesty vnto kings and monarches: Celeste oraculu^, Diuinitas, Eternitas, Eternales vultus.Alberic. Gentilis lib. 2. lection. and epistolar. c. 14. Maiestie therefore, which by some is said to be the daughter of honor and reuerence, ought alwaies, and in all things to be respected with honor and reuerence.

Anglonomophylax,
I will particularly examin all the precedent matters of your last discourse, which haue any resemblance or be of any vse in our Law, sithence order enforceth me to speake of disorder, and of the disloyall, and sedicious, and trayterous attempts against the person of the Prince, and the good estate of the Common weale, which may fully appeare by a statut made 25. E. 3. de proditionibus cap. 2. and likewise by the Common Law, for as Thorpe saith 22.5 The diuers kinds of treason by the common law. E. 3.22. E. 3. p. 49 it is treason to succor the kings enemies, and to leuie war against the King in his Realme, or to be adherent to the Kings enemies in his Realme, by giuing them aid and comfort in his Realme or other-where is made treason by the abouesaid
 Statut, as may appeare by the case of sir Nicholas Throgmorton, who was arraigned for being of counsell with Wyat in leuying his seditious war.1. Ma. Dy. 98 Crom. Iu. P. 40 And D. Story being beyond the sea, and practising with a forrein Prince to inuade the Realme and to worke the death of our dread Soueraigne Lady the Queene, was iustly atteynted of high treason,13.

It seemeth to me that these words should only extend to lieges and subiects.


Anglonomoph.
6 How farre forth this word (leageance) doth extend by the Common law.Nay they doe extend to any one who is in the Realme in the time of peace, and hee that hath the benefit of the Queenes peace (forein or other) ought not to violate or disturbe it any way, but if it had beene in time of warre betwixt the two kingdomes, then hee could not haue beene arraigned, but should haue been ransomed:7 How the Q. enemies are to be punished by the comon law agreeing with the law of God. but he that in a forrein common weale, where hee is permitted to soiourne,4. Mar. 144 Dyer. will raise tumults, and kindle rebellion, deserueth to bee punished as a rebell, and therefore it is truely and iudicially said of Albericus Gentilis: Criminosos, violentos, ne quidem veri dei tuetur altare, quos neque intuetur deus, nisi iratus,Alb. Gentil. lib. 2. de Arm. Rom. c. 2. And againe: Innocentia praestat securitatem.A. Gent. li. 1 de Arm. Rom. c. 2. And therefore the Romanes did well in arraigning Bomilcar of treason, who being a straunger conspired against their state:Salust. in Iugurth. But it is true which before I said, that if warre be
 betwixt two Kings, as namely the King of Fez, and the King of Polonia, if the King of Polonia doe in his owne kingdome take prisoner one of the subiects of the King of Fez working mischiefe against him, this is lawfull: but to arraigne him or put him to death is vnlawfull: for a prisoner so taken is to bee put to his ransome, but not to open shame as a traytor: and therefore the Prophet said vnto the King of Israell: An quos captiuos abduceres, gladio tuo and arcu tuo eos percuteres? Eliseus by a wonderfull miracle did make the Syrians, enemies to the King of Israel, his captiues, whom the King would haue slaine, but the Prophet did forbid him by this argument, that they which are taken in warre ought not to be slaine, much lesse these whom God had giuen vp into his hands.4.

The fouretenth Dialogue, of Homicide that is murder, manslaughter, and homicide by chance or misfortune.

NOmomath.
Because the apt diuision of  things giueth great light and ministreth exceeding helpe to the knowledge and vnderstanding of them, I would therfore know Codicgn. how many kinds of homicide are set downe in your Law.


Codicgn.
Homicide in our Law,1 The seuerall kinds of homicide by the Ciuill law, and first murder is described.2 Ma^slaughter se defende^do by the Ciuill Law. is either the wilfull killing of a man of set purpose,l. 1. in princ. and in @ diuus ff. ad l. Corn. de sicar. and l. 2. C. cod. or else the killing of a man in the defence of his owne person, as if I.N. should assault I.S. with a sword he may defend himselfe with a sword, and so auoid the iniury, if otherwise he cannot eschew it: but if I.S. may fly from him without danger, then the Law bindeth him to fly, but if a man should so assault me, that he should driue me to a verie narrow pinch, so that I cannot find a meane to escape with my life, in this case it is lawful for me manfully to defend my selfe, though it be with killing him,Iodoc. Da^conderius in rerum carmin. prax. c. 78. and 79 and these sorts of manslaughter may be committed with clubb,in d. @ diuus l. 1. ff. ad leg. Corn. de sicar. stone, sword, or dart, with arrowes, lances, pertisanes, iauelius, or with guns,Iust. de pub. iudic. @ Item lex Corn. or a man may be killed with poysonl. 3. @ 1 ff Ad Corn. de sicar. or by precipitation and being throwne headlong from the topp of some house, or some bridge, or some hill,3 The discription of selfeslaughter by the Ciuill Law or some tree,d. l. 1. ff ad leg. Corn. de sicar. there is an other kind of homicide, which is tearmed homicidium sui ipsius when a man killeth himselfe, and such offendors
 are punished by our Law according to the qualitie of their minde, whereby they were moued: for if they kill themselues through griefe or impatienceG. de Bon. eoru^ qui mort. sibi consc. of some infirmity,4 A diuersity of killing a mans selfe by the Ciuill Law no punishment followeth their fact, but they are left to the tribunal of the Almighty Iudge of the quick and the dead: but if they kill themselues vpon any other cause their goods are confiscated,Authen. bona da^natorum C. de Bon. da^nat. Nouel. 134 c. fin. ff. de iur. fisc. and C. de priuil. fisc. tit. lit. and their bodies thogh they be dead, and so impassible, and free from punishment, yet for the terror of them that liue, they are thus ordered,5 The punishment of selfeslaughter by the Ciuill Law The body is drawne out of the house, wherein the man did kill himselfe, with ropes, not by the dore, but through some hoal or pit made vnder the threshold of the dore because it is vnworthy to be brought out the same way, which the man whilest he liued, did vse: and he is drawne by a horse to the place of punishment or shame, where he is hanged vpon a gibbet, and none may take the body down, but by the authority of the magistrate:Da^houder. in prax. rer. criminal. c. 88. and none may weare any mourning roabe for such an offendor.l. liberorum @ Pomponius in versic. no^ solent. ff. de his qui notan. infamia. The last kind of homicide,6 Homicide by casualty is described is homicide per infortunium, or homicidium casuale, as if a Tiler with one of his tiles which he vseth about his worke, do hurt or kill one that passeth by, he is not to be punished for this hurt or fault, if he did giue warning before in conuenient time,Argum. l. cu^ quis l. si soluturus ff. de solut. l. 1 in princ. and l. de pupillo @ in pluriu^, ff. de nou oper. nuntiat. the like may be said of these which vse bowes, or crosbowes, which lop trees, or cut the^ down by the roote, if a man be slain therby,l. si putator. ff. ad l Aquil. ff. item si putator, de l.

 such things as are permitted by law, yet such persons must susteyne an arbitraty punishment, because so great a mischiefe ensueth,Damhorder ret. criminal. prax. cap. 85. and so it is of others which throw sodainly staffes or stones, at birds or dogges, and by that meanes hurt or kill, a man,Damhorder ibid. but yet God would haue man to be free from this fault, and therefore such offendors had Asyla, Temples of Mercy permitted vnto them as things necessary for their absolution.Deuter. 19. ver. 5.


Anglonomop.
It seemeth that wee make more kinds of Homicide then you,7 Ang. Taketh exception to the diuision of Homicide by the Ciuill law. for with vs their is one kinde of Homicide of malitious purpose which wee call murder, an other which is comitted vpon the sodaine in a heate and furie of minde, which we terme manslaughter, a third which we cal se defendendo, a fourth per infortunium, the fifth Homicide of a mans selfe, whereby the offendor is called Felo de se.


Nomom.
Indeed Codicgn. you haue not as to me seemeth, comprehended in your diuision all the particular kinds of Homicide: for you seeme vnder your first member, which is the wilful killing of a man of malice forethought, to comprehend manslaughter, which is done in the heate and furie of anger and sodaine falling out.


Codicgn.
Indeed so I did meane it,8 An other diuision of Homicide by the Ciuill Law. for our most compendious and complete diuision of Homicide is thus: either it is done destinato, or necessario, or casu destinato, when a man of malice preconceiued doth kill himselfe or an other man, as Nero, Iudas, and others, which kinde of manslaughter is impious, because the powre of life and
 death is Gods and not ours, and therefore is not to be vsurped by man, wherefore we haue a verie good rule. Nemo membrorum suorum dominus est:l. liber homo ff. ad leg. Aquil and l. lex. Corne. @ Constitutum ff. ad l. Corn. de ficar. Necessario a man comitteth manslaugter, when he doth it in his owne defence, and to beat backe force by force, which kind of manslaughter being done by necessitie, and not by will, deserueth pardon according to the saying:
Iudice me, fraus est concessa repellere fraudem.Armaque in armatos sumere iura sinunt. And it is a Maxime in our Law: Quod quisque in tutelam corporis sui fecerit, iure fecisse existimatur:l. vt vim. ff. de inst. and iur. Casu Homicide is comitted, when a man killeth one not purposing that, but doing another thing as the Hebrews do report of Lamech, that meaning to strike a wild beast he killed Cain with his dart,Ioh. Wolph. in Comm. ad Deuteron. li. 2. and so you may perceiue that we comprehend that which you cal murder, and that which you call man slaughter vnder that kind of homicide which is committed destinato.


Nomomat.
I do rather perceiue it, then approue it: wherefore I would haue you Anglonomophylax to shew the difference betwixt these two kinds in their seueral natures, and what difference they hold from other kindes of Homicide, that so I may more easily vnderstand wherein your Lawes agree or disagree, and likewise the reasons of the said accordance and disagreement.


Anglonomop.
The difference of killing men
 voluntarily and inuoluntarily is verie auncient.Genes. 9. and 4 Exod. 21. Deutren. 5. Leuit. 24. Numb. 35. Deutren. 19. And Demosthones saith,8 The differe^ce of killing men voluntarily and inuoluntarily is shewed to be ancie^t that the Phaenicians did punnishe such as did voluntarily kill men with death, and with the losse of all that they had: but such as did vnwillingly cause the death of a man they did pardon and forgiueDemost. in orat. cont. Mid: But the difference betwixt murder and manslaughter hath not bin heretofore much odened, or effectually stood vpon, which because it is large and of great compasse in our Law, I will (God permitting me) by some cases make cleere and apparant, and then discend to the discription of the other kinds of Homicide.9 The difinition of murder by the Common law Murder is when a man killeth an other feloniously vpon malice forethought,Pl. Com. 261 and it is not materiall whether he kill him, openly or secretly, or whether he that is slaine bee an Englishman, or of other nation, if he liue in this Realme vnder the Queenes protection,Stamf. 18. and he cannot haue the benefit of Clergie and Sanctuary,22. H. 8. c. 1. and there be two sorts of malice which are motiues to this horrible act,10 Malice whereof murder commeth, is shewed to be two fold and diuers cases are put thereupon. namely a malice implyed, and a malice expressed: malice implyed is when one killeth an other sodainly without any defence on the part of the other: malice expressed, when it is knowne that there is malice betwixt the parties:Crompt. Iu: P. 19. I will illustrate both these seuerall kinds with seueral cases, beginning first with malice implyed. A Gaoler had malice to a Recusant who was in his ward, because he suspected that he was too familiar with his wife, and after the prisoner purposed to goe out of prison, as he went
 before for his disporte, and the Goaler suddenly stroke the prisoner vpon the head, so that he fell to the ground, whereupon he dyed, and this was adiudged murder at the Assises at Chester:Cromp. Iu. P. 20 And if a theefe rob an other man, and kill him, this is murder, though hee did neuer see the man slaine before, and though he had neuer inueterate malice against him: yet he had malice before the murder to this intent, that hee would rather kill him then be disapointed of his purpose.Com. 474 Two fought together of malice forethought, hauing purpose to kill, and a stranger came to part them and one of them killed him, this was felonie in them both, and they both were executed because they had an intent the one of them to kill the other, and this act came originally of that:22. E. 3. Coron. 262. and Dyer 120 And if the Iustices of Peace with the Sheriffe come to suppresse riotors, and one which attendeth vpon them is slaine by one of the riotors, this is murder in him, and in all the other riotors which are present.Cro. I. P. 21. And if a man without quarrell offered doe kill one of the standers by, this is murder,Cro. I. P. 22. proceeding from implyed malice,Lam. Eirenarch. 255. Thus far of malice implyed: malice expressed may more easily appeare vnto you, as if a man bring an appeale of felonie against B. and the said B. meeteth the plaintife, and they quarrel together vpon the vsing of the said appeale, and fight, and B. killeth the plaintife, this seemeth to be murder,Cro. I. P. 21. and if a man be attrinted of murder he shall suffer paine of death,11 The punishment of murder by the Common law and shall forfeit lands, and goods, and chattels: but manslaughter as it is in fact lesse
 heynous, so it is in punishment lesse greeuous,12 The discription of manslaughter by the Common Law. for it is then committed when two or more fight together vpon the suddaine without malice precedent, and the one of them killeth the other, in such case the offendor shall haue his Clergie,Cromp. I. P. 23. Com. 261. but shall forfeit his goods,13 The punishment of manslaughter by the commo^ law. and if two doe fight together without malice precedent, and after diuers blowes giuen, the one of them flyeth a great space from the other, and the other goeth into a house verie neere for a weapon, and pursueth incontinent, and killeth him that flyeth, this is but manslaughter, because it was done in a continuing furie,Crompt. Iu. P. 23. and two did fight together vpon the suddaine without malice preconceiued, and one commeth to part them, and the one of them which fighteth killeth him, this is manslaughter in him, because the fighting was an vnlawful act:22. Ass. Coron. 180 but if they had fought together Ex maltiia precogitata, and the one of them had slaine him, this had been felonie in them both.22. E. 3. Cor^ 266. Stamf. 16. Manslaughter se defendendo is,14 Ma^slaughter se defende^do by the commo^ law. where two fight together vpon the suddaine, and before a mortall wound on either party, the one flyeth vnto the wall, or to some other place, beyond which he cannot passe for the safegard of his life, and the other pursueth him, and he which flyeth killeth him that pursueth, this is manslaughter in his owne defence,3. E. 3. Cor. 284. and 286. and it is not materiall in this case which of them begun the affray, or which of them gaue the first strokeStamf. 15., and the offendor in this case shall forfeit his goods4. H. 7. 2. 43. Ass pl. 3. 21. E. 3. 17.,16 Homicide by misaduenture. homicide by misaduenture is no other then hath been described by Codicgn. for he
 hath recited out of the Ciuill Law almost all the cases which we reade in our Law bookes: and his distinction likewise is of force and effect with vs: for if a man do an vnlawfull act,17 The punishment of it. and any misaduenture doe happen vpon it, by which a man is slaine, this is felony though it be not murder: and for euery homicide by mischaunce a man shall forfeit his goods22. Ass. cor. 180. Stamf. lib. 1. c. 4., likewise he that is a homicide of himselfe,18 Homicide of a mans selfe and the punishment of it. is such as hath been before discouered by Codicgnost. and he by our Law shall forfeit his goods.Fitz. coron. 301. 362. 426.

I pray you let me know this Codicgn. whether he that counselleth, commandeth, abetteth or assisteth a murderer, ought by your Law to be taken and censured as a murderer?


Codicgnost.
Yes verily, for homicide is either consilij or operis,1 Homicide is shewed to be twofold in the Ciuill Law consilij, and operis. and therefore if a man counsell one to doe a murder, who if the counsell had not beene would haue done it, hee that executeth the counsell, and he that giueth the counsel, are both in the eye of the Law murderersc. ficut dignu^ 1. @ qui vero de homicid Extr. and cap. fin. co. tit. lib. 6. and l. qui seruo. ff. de fure^ etc. Nullus ex consilio de regal. iur. in sext..

They may as well thinke that there bee no diuels,1 Homicide by witchcraft is described. surely Europe is too full of such wicked wretches, which either by magicall artes calling vp damned spirits, or corrupting the elements, which God hath made for the vse of this life, do worke the destruction of many innocent persons, or else by acquainting themselues with familiar diuels doe effect the like mischiefe,1 The punishment of witches and magicians by the Ciuill Law and their iudgement in our law, because they are such strangers to nature, is, quod feralis bestia eos absumatl. multi. C. de malefic. and mathem.,
 and such as by Images of waxe inchanted doe cause the death of any man, if they be conuicted and do confesse the fault they are punished as is before said, but if they will not confesse, their flesh it torne from the bone with nailes and with hookesl. fi excepta @ fi quis C. de malefic., and not onely witches,3 They that haue asked counsell of wi^ches haue been in antient time punished. but euen such as haue asked counsell of Witches for the remedy of diseases, haue beene in former times punished. For Ammianus reporteth, that in the time of the sonnes of Constantine, and the other Emperors, which next succeeded them, If any man did weare about his neck any thing as a remedy of the feuer quartaine, or any other infirmity, he was punished capitally as accessarie to witchcraftAmmian. Marcell. li. 19.: and he telleth in an other place that a certein simple old woman, because shee was wonte to cure feuers by a kind of inchantment, was put to death as guiltie of witchcraft: and a young man in the bath putting his hands sometime to a marble stone, and sometime to his breast, and rehearsing withall, certaine letters of the Alphabet, imagining this to be a good remedie against the paine of the stomache, was put to death by the sword.Ammia. l. 29.

It may be that Codicgn. had rather beleeue the censures of Romane Magistrates in matters of Iustice, then the opinions of Roman and Graecian Philosophers in table talke and common speech. I knowe by good authoritie these thinges are condemned, and therefore it is said of such men and their medicines in the Canon. Quae alij scelera, isti remidia nominantc. Illud quod 26. q. 2.. And Tacitus clearly affirmeth that such things medicorum disciplina condemnatTacit. lib. 1. histor.: And Plutarch calleth such practises InsaniasPlutarch. in pericl.: and if Lucian be of any authoritie with you, he saith, Per verbula and incantationes sanitatem operari non credoLucian. in philopseud.. Pliny likewise speaketh to the same purpose in these words Maximae quaestionis and semper incertae est, valiantne aliquid verba et incantamenta carminum in medendo: sed viritim sapientissimi cuiusque respuit fidesPlin. lib. 28. c 2.: As for these exorcismes heretofore vsed in the Church, Bodinus teacheth that the Prophets
 neuer vsed in their times any such matterBodin lib. 3. daemon., and he saith further,5 Answer is made to the aforesaid obiectio^ according to the opinion of Bodinus. that the primitiue Church neuer vsed them, and he disalloweth the testimonie of Iosephus, and disproueth it in this point: but sithence the matter is so doubtfull, I doe not think that the Law-maker ought to punish the vsing and applying of charmes, or such things, which are for that purpose hanged about the necke of the sicke body, if they be innocently done and without mixture of magicke or euill arte, with death: but it principally apperteyneth to diuines and preachers to extirpate such superstitions out of the hearts of men, and to teach them that it is irreligious, and against the glorie of God, to goe for remedy to such dumbe things, and not to God himselfe, and that faulse is that saying of Apuleius, Nihil quod salutis causa fit criminosum est: for their is nothing subiect to the vse of man so good, but it may be abused: yet surely the Lawes ought not to extend their seueritie against this last recited fault, if no greater fault be ioyned with it.

But in many things, and doubtlesse in this, they do neither lie nor dallie: for whereas Virgill saith, Atque satas alio vidi traducere messes, this is no flying fancy, but the sage and graue determination of the makers of the lawes of the twelue Tables, where it is said in the old Latine,8 The laws of the 12. tables do condemne witchcraft. Qui alienas fruges excantauerit quiue alienam segete^ pellexerit. Quei alienas fruces excantassit queiue alienam secetem pelexerit: and therefore vaine is the surmise of Seneca when he said of such matters,9 Seneca his opinion of charmes and inchantments is disliked.

If such hurt be done, it is done by the diuell, and the wicked spirits his ministers, which suggest such things to silly old women, and are readie to performe them at their command: but what fault can be iustly imputed to these women.


Canonol.
Surely their offence is verie great,12 Witches are proued to be apostats, and in what maner they become apostates for they are most abominable apostats, and workers of extreame mischief, they haue denied Christ and
 vowed themselues to the diuell, which maner of vow is done either secretly or expresly: secretly, when one witch or coniurer voweth with an other coniurer or witch, that in consideration that A. hath promised to B. that he shall do great and meruailous things, as namely that he shall know future things, and doe other things, which others shall not be able to do, B. therefore promiseth to A. that therefore he will renounce the Catholike faith, that he will obstinately despise the holy Sacraments, that he will with all his strength and power worship and cleaue to his master, and wil giue to him all kind of adoration vnder the forme of idols: and this is called a secret protestatio^, because it is not done to the diuel himselfe but to his seruantc qui sine saluatore 26 q. 2.

At what place and in what time is this wickednesse done?


Canon.
It is done in woddie places, or in caues vnder the earth, which are far remote and distante from the places of mens conuersation, such dark and shadowed groues and corners, as are verie fully portrayted by Lucan.Lucan li. 3.

Lucus erat longo nunquam violatus ab aeuo.
Obscurum cingens connexis aera ramis,
Omnisque humanis lustrata cruoribus orbos:
Illis and volucres metuunt insistere ramis
Et lustris recubare ferae, etc.

In such desolate places, or in ruinated castles this mischiefe is celebrated, and commonly it is don in the darkenesse of a most tempestuous nightc. Episcopi 26. q. 5., for the Diuell falling from Paradise fell into extreame darkenesse, and by defect of grace deliteth in darkenesT. Aquinas in tractat. 44. quaestion 16 artic. 1. est in tit. de daemon., so that all the workes that proceed from him are blacke, horrible, and full of darkenes, cleane contrary to the workes of our Sauior Christ, which he did in the open light, for the glorifying of his father and the edifying of his Church.

Yet my assertion remayneth firme,
 that all the euils whereof you haue before spoke^ are done by the diuel, and not by the witch.


Canonologus,
They are done by the witch cooperating with the diuell,13 It is proued that the bodies of witches do worke with their minds in lewd ente^prises. who will not doe any such hurt without their command, for surely the bewitching of mens bodies must needes be accounted their owne worke. The bodies of aged persons are impure, which when they waxe cankered in malice, they vse their verie breath and their sight being apt for contagion, and by the diuell whetted for such purpose, to the vexation and destruction of others: for if they which are troubled with the disease of the eies called Ophthalmia, do infect others that looke earnestly vpon them: is it any meruaile that these wicked treatures hauing both bodies and mindes in a higher degree corrupted, should worke both these and greater mischiefes? but their malice doth especially exercise it selfe vpon the weake and tender bodies of children and yong women, which are most subiect to the impression of the ayre, that is infected by them, as Heliodorus plainely shewethHeliod. Ethiopic. lib. 3., and that it hath been so thought in antient time, may appeare by Theocritus speaking of the remedy which was wont to be vsed against such witchcraftTheocrit. eidyl. 6. and 7., and againe they deserue seuerely to be punished, not onely for vowing themselues to the diuell, but also for mingling themselues in the companie of wicked spirits, which must needs infect their bodies and soules, and so make them apt instruments for the hurting of others.



Nomom.
I doe not thinke,14 Alciate his opinion touching the meting of witches amongst themselues, and the meeting of the diuer is vrged. that is possible to be done, which is commonly reported of witches, dwelling in seuerall places, meeting one an other and meeting likewise the diuell, and that opinion holdeth Alciat,Alciat. lib. 8. parerg. cap. 22. and some other in these daies: wherfore I see no reason that they should be punished for it.


Canonologus,
That is both true and possible,15 Alciate his said opinion is confronted by the authoritie of Bodinus. as against Alciat, and other writers strangely conceited in this point, Bodinus hath largely and learnedly disputed. Alciat denieth it to be possible, that naturally bodies, which are said to meet in places far distant, should at the naming of Iesus vanishe into the ayre, and be carried swiftly and inuisibly thether, but this is possible enough: For if the spirits can not in a moment withdraw the sight of things, surely they can do verie little: for this is many waies done, and iuggelers and professors of feates can performe it, and as to the swift transporting of them to remote places, Bodinus reasoneth well; that if the Spirit of the eight Sphaere of the heauens, doe mooue a thing of so great compasse and quantity in so short a space, that in one howre it passeth aboue a hundred times an hundred miles, why may not a wicked spirit carrie the small bodies of such witches in the minute of an howre, the space of a hundred or two hundred miles: yet I do not thinke it possible which some affirme, that the bodies of such witches may pierce through a chinke or riffe of a wall (for the nature of the body cannot be altered)
 but this seemeth rather to be an illusion of the diuell offered to witches: but what of this? suppose that a witch doe confesse vnto a Magistrate, that she went in by a riffe of the wall to kill a child, which shee kild, because it is not possible that the witch should passe through such a narrow creuise, shall the Magistrate therefor absolue the witch, as guiltlesse of the childs death? Nay rather let him diuide the matter, and seuer that which is impossible, from that which may be, namely the passing through the riffe of the wall, from the killing of the child: for it may bee, that in truth the diuell brought her in at the doore to kill the child, though he made it seeme to her that she came in at a chinke of the wall: but surely if there were no other fault in witches, then the renouncing of God, and the abiuring of the Sacraments; yet this being in it selfe consummat apostasie, doth deserue extreame punishment, and whosoeuer thinketh that witches, because for the most part, they be sottish, old, and doting, are verie easily deceiued, and therefore ought to bee spared, hee is in a greate error, for malice driueth them to desire that, which by the diuels meanes they compasse; when they haue obteyned it, their froward nature doth ioy in it, and the diuell for the most part leaueth them, before they leaue him.


Nomomat.
Indeed so it seemeth: for when they fall into the handes of Iustice, and bee cast into close prison, the diuell commonly practiseth no
 more feates for them, but suffereth them to susteine the punishment of law without any intermedling for them: but I haue much wondred what should be the cause of this.


Canonol.
That is done for two causes. First,16 A double reason is alleaged wherefore the diuel worketh not for witches after that they be imprisoned. because the diuell seeketh nothing more desirously then the gaine of their soules: for when he thinketh that the soule is wholly brought vnder his power, he expecteth for nothing so greedily, as the departure of the soule from the bodie, that he may torment the soule, which before the death of the party he doth retinere subpacto, and he not only laboureth, but hasteneth his death as much as he can, least repentance (God is the God of mercy) doe deliuer the miserable caytife out of the snare of damnation:c. Nec miru^ 26 q. 5. D. Augustin. lib. 3. de Trin. 10. de ciuit. dei. Thom^ Aquin. in tractat. 44. primae partis quest. 5. in tit. de mira. an other reason is wherefore they being imprisoned cannot escape though the diuell would deliuer them out of prison, is because the Iustice of Almightie God will not suffer the diuell to exercise his naturall power for them: for if he should permit him, God might perhaps seeme to weake and shallow consciences, to haue cast of the care of humaine affaires, and of doing Iustice: wherefore for his truth and glorie he will not suffer it.D. Aug. d. lib. 10. de ciuit. dei and T. Aqu. in d. tract. 44. d. q. 5.

But a man may reason out of Canonicall Scripture that it was no diuell which appeared to Saul in the likeness of Samuel, because the diuell would not vse such holy speeches as are attributed to Samuel, in the first booke of Samuel, which is Canonical Scripture.1. Sam. c. 28.


Canonologus,
What meruaile is that? when the diuell can transforme himselfe into an Angel of light? and so he did deliuer true testimonie of ChristMatt. 8 Mar. 1. Luck. 4., though to a false and euill purpose, and likewise of PauleAct. 16., but holy Samuel would not
 haue suffered any such adoration, as is expressed in that Scripture: and therefore Tremellius and Iunius do rightly comment vpon that place, that it is not in the power of the diuell, nor of the witch his seruant, to draw againe into the world iust men, but that it was a crafty and false pretence of the diuel to make men think that the true worshipers of God are in his hands after their death.

NOmomat.
Time now requireth that yee should deliuer your opinions of these crimes which are against the good estat of man, as theft, burglarie, and robberie, and because theft is either single as pettie larcenie, and the sole act of taking away feloniously a mans goods: or else compounded and mixt with other wrongfull acts, as when burglarie and robbery are committed, therefore first I would haue you to speake of the former, and after of the latter: wherfore shew me first Codicgn. what is accou^ted pettie larceny or pilfering the euery in your law, and how it is to be punished.

1 The definition of theft by the ciuill law.Theft is thus defined in our Law: (A fraudulent contrectation of an other mans corporall moueable goods, which is don against the will of the owner, with a mind to gain either by the things stolne,2 Wherefore the word (fraudulent) is vsed in the definition of theft. or by the possession of them,ff. de paen. l. 1. in fi. or by the vse of them)a and this word (fraudulent) is therefore vsed in the definition, because if a man
 take away an other mans goods as thinking him to be the owner that biddeth him take them, or mistaking the goods which the owner appointed him to take, he is not in this case guilty of theft,Iusti. vi. bon. rapt. @. ita tamen. because neither the contrectation onely, nor the fraud only doth make a theefe,Arg. d. l. 1. @. inde sola.

Codicgnostes,
1 Receiuers and theeues haue the like punishment in the ciuil Law, but yet with many diuercities and limitations.Because these receiuors are a lewd sort of men, without whom malefactors cannot long be vnknowne, therefore our Law inflicteth vpon them and the others which commit theft, the like punishment,l. 1.

C. de his qui latron. which punishment is sometime wayed by the quality of the person, by the greatnes of offences and by the multitude of offences iterated as before hath bin shewed: but if he whom he hideth, haue committed robbery or burglary, of what estate
 soeuer he be, and though it were the first offence, both in the theefe and in the fauourer, yet either of them shal susteine the like punishment:d. l. 1. C. de his qui latran. and l. 1. @ in par. ff de receptat. but here an other distinction is to be vsed, for either he fauored the theefe, or the theft: if he fauor the theft he shall haue equall punishment with the theefe,l. secunda. @ non tantum ff. de ince^d. ruin. naufrag. but if he fauor not the theft, but only the person of the theefe, then he is punishable by the same Law, but not by the same paine, for then his punishment is arbitrary, and left wholy to the discretion of the Iudge,l. 1. in fin. ff. de receptat. and in the very same state are they, which when they may apprehend such malefactors doe either for lucre, or for part of the things stolne let them goe.d. l. 1. ff. eo.
