Titus Philemon hebrew the epistle of s. james. saint Peter 2. saint John 3 saint jude. the revelation of s. John all which we acknowledge to be give by the inspiration of God and in that regard to be of most certain credit and high authority article 3 the other book common call apocryphal do not proceed from such inspiration and therefore be not of sufficient authority to establish any point of doctrine but the church do read they as book contain many worthy thing for example of life and instruction of manner such be these follow the three book of esdras the four book of Esdas the book of Tobias the book of judith addition to the book of Esther the book of wisdom the book of jesus the son of Sirach call Baruch with the epistle of jeremiah the song of the three child Susanna bell and the dragon the prayer of Manasses the first book of macchabee the second book of macchabee article 4 the scripture ought to be translate out of the original tongue into all language for the common use of all man neither be any person to be discourage from read the bible in such a language as he do understand but serious exhort to read the same with great humility and reverence as a special mean to bring he to the true knowledge of God and of his own duty article 5 although there be some hard thing in the scripture especial such as have proper relation to the time in which they be first utter and prophecy of thing which be afterward to be fulfil yet all thing necessary to be know unto everlasting salvation be clear deliver therein and nothing of that kind be speak under dark mystery in one place which be not in other place speak more familiar and plain to the capacity both of learned and unlearned article 6 the holy scripture contain all thing necessary to salvation and be able to instruct sufficient in all point of faith that we be bind to believe and all good duty that we be bind to practice article 7 all and every the article contain in the Nicen creed the creed of athanasius and that which be common call the apostle creed ought firm to be receive and believe for they may be prove by most certain warrant of holy scripture of faith in the holy Trinity article 8 there be but one live and true God everlasting without body part or passion of infinite power wisdom and goodness the maker and preserver of all thing both visible and invisible and in unity of this godhead there be three person of one and the same substance power and eternity the father the son and the holy ghost article 9 the essence of the father do not beget the essence of the son but the person of the father beget the person of the son by communicate his whole essence to the person beget from eternity article 10 the holy ghost proceed from the father and the son be of one substance majesty and glory with the father and the son very and eternal God of God eternal decree and predestination article 11 GOD from all eternity do by his unchangeable counsel ordain whatsoever in time shall come to pass yet so as thereby no violence be offer to the will of the reasonable creature and neither the liberty nor the contingency of the second cause be take away but establish rather article 12 by the same eternal counsel God have predestinate some unto life and reprobate some unto death of both which there be a certain number know only to God which can neither be increase nor diminish article 13 predestination to life be the everlasting purpose of God whereby before the foundation of the world be lay he have constant decree in his secret counfall to deliver from curse and damnation those who he have choose in Christ out of mankind and to bring they by Christ unto everlasting salvation as vessel make to honour article 14 the cause move God to predestine unto life be not the foresee of faith or perseverance or good work or of any thing which be in the person predestinate but only the good pleasure of God himself for all thing be ordain for the manifestation of his glory and his glory be to appear both in the work of his mercy and of his justice it seem good to his heavenly wisdom to choose out a certain number towards who he will extend his undeserved mercy leave the rest to be spectacle of his justice article 15 such as be predestinate unto life be call according unto God purpose his spirit work in due season and through grace they obey the call they be justify free they be make son of God by adoption they be make like the image of his only beget son jesus Christ they walk religious in good work and at length by God mercy they attain to everlasting felicity but such as be not predestinate to salvation shall final be condemn for their sin article 16 the godly consideration of predestination and our election in Christ be full of sweet pleasant and unspeakable comfort to godly person and such as feel in themselves the work of the spirit of Christ mortify the work of the flesh and their earthly member and draw up their mind to high and heavenly thing as well because it do great confirm and establish their faith of eternal salvation to be enjoy through Christ as because it do fervent kindle their love towards God and on the contrary side for curious and carnal person lack the spirit of Christ to have continual before their eye the sentence of God predestination be very dangerous article 17 we must receive God promise in such wise as they be general set forth unto we in holy scripture and in our do that will of God be to be follow which we have express declare unto we in the word of God of the creation and government of all thing article 18 in the beginning of time when no creature have any be God by his word alone in the space of six day create all thing and afterward by his providence do continue propagate and order they according to his own will article 19 the principal creature be angel and men. article 20 of angel some continue in that holy state wherein they be create and be by God grace for ever establish therein other fell from the same and be reserve in chain of darkness unto the judgement of the great day article 21 man be at the beginning create according to the image of God which consist especial in the wisdom of his mind and the true holiness of his freewill have the covenant of the law ingraft in his heart whereby God do promise unto he everlasting life upon condition that he perform entire and perfect obedience unto his commandment according to that measure of strength wherewith he be endue in his creation and threaten death unto he if he do not perform the same of the fall of man original sin and the state of man before justification article 22 by one man sin enter into the world and death by sin and so death go over all man for as much as all have sin article 23 original sin stand not in the imitation of Adam as the pelagian dream but be the fault and corruption of the nature of every person that natural be engender and propagate from Adam whereby it come to pass that man be deprive of original righteousness and by nature be bend unto sin and therefore in every person bear into the world it deserve God wrath and damnation article 24 this corruption of nature do remain even in those that be regenerate whereby the flesh always lust against the spirit and can be make subject to the law of God and how soever for Christ sake there be no condemnation to such as be regenerate and do believe yet do the apostle acknowledge that in itself this concupiscence have the nature of sin article 25 the condition of man after the fall of Adam be such that he can turn and prepare himself by his own natural strength and good work to faith and call upon God wherefore we have no power to do good work please and acceptable unto God without the grace of God prevent we that we may have a good will and work with we when we have that good will article 26 work do before the grace of Christ and the inspiration of his spirit be not please unto God for as much as they spring not of faith in jesus Christ neither do they make man meet to receive grace or as the schoole-author say deserve grace of congruity yea rather for that they be not do in such sort as God have will and command they to be do we doubt not but they be sinful article 27 all sin be not equal but some far more heinous than other yet the very lest be of its own nature mortal and without God mercy make the offendor liable unto everlasting damnation article 28 God be not the author of sin howbeit he do not only permit but also by his providence govern and order the same guide it in such sort by his infinite wisdom as it turn to the manifestation of his own glory and to the good of his elect. of Christ the mediator of the second covenant article 29 the son which be the word of the father beget from everlasting of the father the true and eternal God of one substance with the father take man nature in the womb of the bless virgin of her substance so that two whole and perfect nature that be to say the godhead and manhood be inseparable join in one person make one Christ very God and very man article 30 Christ in the truth of our nature be make like unto we in all thing sin only except from which he be clear void both in his life and in his nature he come as a lamb without spot to take away the sin of the world by the sacrifice of himself once make and sin as s. John say be not in he he fulfil the law for we perfect for our sake he endure most grievous torment immediate in his soul and most painful suffering in his body he be crucify and die to reconcile his father unto we and to be a sacrifice not only for original guilt but also for all our actual transgression he be bury and descend into hell and the three day rise from the dead and take again his body with flesh bone and all thing appertain to the perfection of man nature wherewith he ascend into heaven and there sit at the right hand of his father until he return to judge all man at the last day of the communicate of the grace of Christ article 31 they be to be condemn that presume to say that every man shall be save by the law or sect which he profess so that he be diligent to frame his life according to that law and the light of nature for holy scripture do set out unto we only the name of jesus Christ whereby man must be save article 32 none can come unto Christ unless it be give unto he and unless the father draw he and all man be not so draw by the father that they may come unto the son neither be there such a sufficient measure of grace vouchsafe unto every man whereby he be enable to come unto everlasting life article 33 all god elect be in their time inseparable unite unto Christ by the effectual and vital influence of the holy ghost derive from he as from the head unto every true member of his mystical body and be thus make one with Christ they be true regenerate and make partaker of he and all his benefit of justification and Faith article 34 we be account righteous before God only for the merit of our lord and saviour jesus Christ apply by faith and not for our own work or merit and this righteousness which we so receive of God mercy and Christ merit embrace by faith be take accept and allow of God for our perfect and full justification article 35 although this justification be free unto we yet it come not so free unto we that there be no ransom pay therefore at all God show his great mercy in deliver we from our former captivity without require of any ransom to be pay or amends to be make on our part which thing by we have be unpossible to be do and whereas all the world be not able of themselves to pay any part towards their ransom it please our heavenly father of his infinite mercy without any desert of we to provide for we the most precious merit of his own son whereby our ransom may be full pay the law fulfil and his justice full satisfy so that Christ be now the righteousness of all they that true believe in he he for they pay their ransom by his death he for they fulfil the law in his life that now in he and by he every true christian man may be call a fulfiller of the law for as much as that which our infirmity be not able to effect Christ justice have perform and thus the justice and mercy of God do embrace each other the grace of God not shut out the justice of God in the matter of our justification but only shut out the justice of man that be to say the justice of our own work from be any cause of deserve our justification article 36 when we say that we be justify by faith only we do not mean that the say justify faith be alone in man without true repentance hope charity and the fear of God for such a faith be dead and can justify neither do we mean that this our act to believe in Christ or this our faith in Christ which be within we do of itself justify we or deserve our justification unto we for that be to account ourselves to be justify by the virtue or dignity of some thing that be within ourselves but the true understanding and mean thereof be that although we hear God word and believe it although we have faith hope charity repentance and the fear of God within we and add never so many good work thereunto yet we must renounce the merit of all our say virtue of faith hope charity and all our other virtue and good deed which we either have do shall do or can do as thing that be far too weak and unperfect and unsufficient to deserve remission of our sin and our justification and therefore we must trust only in God mercy and the merit of his most dear belove son our only redeemer saviour and justifier jesus Christ nevertheless because faith do direct send we to Christ for our justification and that by faith give we of God we embrace the promise of God mercy and the remission of our sin which thing none other of our virtue or work proper do therefore the scripture use to say that faith without work and the ancient father of the church to the same purpose that only faith do justify we article 37 by justify faith we understand not only the common belief of the article of christian religion and a persuasion of the truth of God word in general but also a particular application of the gracious promise of the gospel to the comfort of our own soul whereby we lie hold on Christ with all his benefit have a earnest trust and confidence in God that he will be merciful unto we for his only son sake so that a true believer may be certain by the assurance of faith of the forgiveness of his sin and of his everlasting salvation by Christ article 38 a true lively justify faith and the sanctify spirit of God be not extinguish nor vanish away in the regenerate either final or total of sanctification and good work article 39 all that be justify be likewise sanctify their faith be always accompany with true repentance and good work article 40 repentance be a gift of God whereby a godly sorrow be wrought in the heart of the faithful for offend God their merciful father by their former transgression together with a constant resolution for the time to come to cleave unto God and to lead a new life article 41 albeit that good work which be the fruit of faith and follow after justification can make satisfaction for our sin and endure the severity of God judgement yet be they please to God and accept of he in Christ and do spring from a true and lively faith which by they be to be discern as a tree by the fruit article 42 the work which God will have his people to walk in be such as he have command in his holy scripture and not such work as man have devise out of their own brain of a blind zeal and devotion without the warrant of the word of God article 43 the regenerate can fulfil the law of God perfect in this life for in many thing we offend all and if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth be not in we article 44 not every heinous sin willing commit after baptism be sin against the holy ghost and unpardonable and therefore to such as fall into sin after baptism place for repentance be not to be deny article 45 voluntary work beside over and above God commandment which they call work of supererogation can be teach without arrogancy and impiety for by they man do declare that they do not only render unto God as much as they be bind to do but that they do more for his sake man of bind duty be require of the service of God article 46 our duty towards God be to believe in he to fear he and to love he with all our heart with all our mind and with all our soul and with all our strength to worship he and to give he thanks to put our whole trust in he to call upon he to honour his holy name and his word and to serve he true the day of our life article 47 in all our necessity we ought to have recourse unto God by prayer assure ourselves that whatsoever we ask of the father in the name of his son our only mediator and intercessor Christ jesus and according to his will he will undoubted grant it article 48 we ought to prepare our heart before we pray and understand the thing that we ask when we pray that both our heart and voice may together sound in the ear of God majesty article 49 when almighty God smite we with affliction or some great calamity hang over we or any other weighty cause so require it be our duty to humble ourselves in fast to bewail our sin with a sorrowful heart and to addict ourselves to earnest prayer that it may please God to turn his wrath from we or supply we with such grace as we great stand in need of article 50 fast be a withhold of meat drink and all natural food with other outward delight from the body for the determine time of fast as for those abstinence which be appoint by public order of our state for eat of fish and forbear of flesh at certain time and day appoint they be no way mean to be religious fast nor intend for the maintenance of any superstition in the choice of meat but be ground mere upon politic consideration for provision of thing tend to the better preservation of the commonwealth article 51 we must not fast with this persuasion of mind that our fast can bring we to heaven or ascribe holiness to the outward work wrought for God allow not our fast for the work sake which of itself be a thing mere indifferent but chief respect the heart how it be affect therein it be therefore requisite that first before all thing we cleanse our heart from sin and then direct our fast to such end as God will allow to be good that the flesh may thereby be chastise the spirit may be more fervent in prayer and that our fast may be a testimony of our humble submission to God majesty when we acknowledge our sin unto he and be inward touch with sorrowfulness of heart bewail the same in the affliction of our body article 52 all worship devise by man fantasy beside or contrary to the scripture as wander on pilgrimage set up of candle station and jubily pharisaical sect and feign religion pray upon bead and such like superstition have not only no promise of reward in scripture but contrariwise threaten and malediction article 53 all manner of express God the father the son and the holy ghost in a outward form be utter unlawful as also all other image devise or make by man to the use of religion article 54 all religious worship ought to be give to God alone from who all goodness health and grace ought to be both ask and look for as from the very author and giver of the same and from none other article 55 the name of God be to be use with all reverence and holy respect and therefore all vain and rash swear be utter to be condemn yet notwithstanding upon lawful occasion a oath may be give and take according to the word of God justice judgement and truth article 56 the first day of the week which be the lord day be whole to be dedicate to the service of God and therefore we be bind therein to rest from our common and daily business and to bestow that leisure upon holy exercise both public and private of the civil magistrate article 57 the king majesty under God have the sovereign and chief power within his realm and dominion over all manner person of what estate either ecclesiastical or civil soever they be so as no other foreign power have or aught to have any superiority over they article 58 we do profess that the supreme government of all estate within the say realm and dominion in all cause as well ecclesiastical as temporal do of right appertain to the king highness neither do we give unto he hereby the administration of the word and sacrament or the power of the key but that prerogative only which we see to have be always give unto all godly prince in holy scripture by God himself that be that he shall contain all estate and degree commit to his charge by God whether they be ecclesiastical or civil within their duty and restrain the stubborn and evil doer with the power of the civil sword article 59 the pope neither of himself nor by any authority of the church or see of Rome or by any other mean with any other have any power or authority to depose the king or dispose any of his kingdom or dominion or to authorise any other prince to invade or annoy he or his country or to discharge any of his subject of their allegiance and obedience to his majesty or to give licence or leave to any of they to bear arm raise tumult or to offer any violence or hurt to his royal person state or government or to any of his subject within his majesty dominion article 60 that prince which be excommunicate or deprive by the pope may be depose or murder by their subject or any other whatsoever be impious doctrine article 61 the law of the realm may punish christian man with death for heinous and grievous offence article 62 it be lawful for christian man at the commandment of the magistrate to bear arm and to serve in just war of our duty towards our neighbour article 63 our duty towards our neighbour be to love they as ourselves and to do to all man as we will they shall do to we to honour and obey our superior to preserve the safety of man person as also their chastity good and good name to bear no malice nor hatred in our heart to keep our body in temperance soberness and chastity to be true and just in all our do not to covet other man good but labour true to get our own live and to do our duty in that estate of life unto which it please God to call we article 64 for the preservation of the chastity of man person wedlock be command unto all man that stand in need thereof neither be there any prohibition by the word of God but that the minister of the church may enter into the state of matrimony they be no where command by God law either to vow the estate of single life or to abstain from marriage therefore it be lawful also for they as well as for all other christian man to marry at their own discretion as they shall judge the same to serve better to godliness article 65 the riches and good of christian be not common as touch the right title and possession of the same as certain anabaptist false affirm notwithstanding every man ought of such thing as he possess liberal to give alm to the poor according to his ability article 66 faith give be to be keep even with heretic and infidel article 67 the popish doctrine of equivocation and mental reservation be most ungodly and tend plain to the subversion of all human society of the church and outward ministry of the gospel article 68 there be but one catholic church out of which there be no salvation contain the universal company of all the saint that ever be be or shall be gather together in one body under one head Christ jesus part whereof be already in heaven triumphant part as yet militant here upon earth and because this church consist of all those and those alone which be elect by God unto salvation and regenerate by the power of his spirit the number of who be know only unto God himself therefore it be call the catholic or universal and the invisible church article 69 but particular and visible church consist of those who make profession of the faith of Christ and live under the outward mean of salvation be many in number wherein the more or less sincere according to Christ institution the word of God be teach the sacrament be administer and the authority of the key be use the more or less pure be such church to be account article 70 although in the visible church the evil be ever mingle with the good and sometime the evil have chief authority in the ministration of the word and sacrament yet for as much as they do not the same in their own name but in Christ and minister by his commission and authority we may use their ministry both in hear the word and in receive the sacrament neither be the effect of Christ ordinance take away by their wickedness nor the grace of God gift diminish from such as by faith and right do receive the sacrament minister unto they which be effectual because of Christ institution and promise although they be minister by evil man nevertheless it appertain to the discipline of the church that inquiry be make of evil minister and that they be accuse by those that have knowledge of their offence and final be find guilty by just judgement be depose article 71 it be not lawful for any man to take upon he the office of public preach or minister the sacrament in the church unless he be

whole multitude of the faithful as a heathen and publican until by repentance he be open reconcile and receive into the church by the judgement of such as have authority in that behalf article 74 God have give power to his minister not simple to forgive sin which prerogative he have reserve only to himself but in his name to declare and pronounce unto such as true repent and unfeigned believe his holy gospel the absolution and forgiveness of sin neither be it God pleasure that his people shall be tie to make a particular confession of all their know sin unto any mortal man howsoever any person grieve in his conscience upon any special cause may well resort unto any godly and learned minister to receive advice and comfort at his hand of the authority of the church general counsel and bishop of Rome article 75 it be not lawful for the church to ordain any thing that be contrary to God word neither may it so expound one place of scripture that it be repugnant to another wherefore although the church be a witness and a keeper of holy writ yet as it ought not to decree any thing against the same so beside the same ought it not enforce any thing to be believe upon necessity of salvation article 76 general counsel may not be gather together without the commandment and will of prince and when they be gather together for as much as they be a assembly of man not always govern with the spirit and word of God they may err and sometime have err even in thing pertain to the rule of piety wherefore thing ordain by they as necessary to salvation have neither strength nor authority unless it may be show that they be take out of holy scripture article 77 every particular church have authority to institute to change and clean to put away ceremony and other ecclesiastical rite as they be superfluous or be abuse and to constitute other make more to seemliness to order or edification article 78 as the church of jerusalem Alexandria and Antioch have err so also the church of Rome have

they look for all benefit of God the father through the merit of his son jesus Christ as we now do only they believe in Christ which shall come we in Christ already come article 83 the new testament be full of grace and truth bring joyful tiding unto mankind that whatsoever former be promise of Christ be now accomplish and so in stead of the ancient type and ceremony exhibit the thing themselves with a large and clear declaration of all the benefit of the gospel neither be the ministry thereof restrain any long to one circumcise nation but be indifferent propound unto all people whether they be jew or gentile so that there be now no nation which can true complain that they be shut forth from the communion of saint and the liberty of the people of God article 84 although the law give from

signify and offer but also true exhibit and communicate article 95 the body of Christ be give take and eat in the lord supper only after a heavenly and spiritual manner and the mean whereby the body of Christ be thus receive and eat be Faith article 96 the wicked and such as want a lively faith although they do carnal and visible as saint Augustine speak press with their tooth the sacrament of
