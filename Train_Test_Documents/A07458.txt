hold within the city of montment for trial of all his knight whither assemble a innumerable company of king prince baron and knight all subject unto he amongst the rest come a wealthy prince name Clarissa much more beholden to fortune for his riches then to nature for his valour for though he be not repute a coward yet those which know he know he dare not fight this Clarissa lodge in the house of Barbin and when the first day of triumph come which by decree be to continue three day and a massy cup of gold propose for a prize to the victor every one arm himself and Clarissa also arm himself outward more rich than any though inward his heart be tatter with a trustless resolution when mervin behold he arm he humble entreat the pagan that he may attend his person to the tiltyard Clarissa when he behold through the reflection of the young man beauty a unmatchable splendour of conceal valour he exchange his fear to hopeful audacity and condescend to his entreaty desire the youth that if he see as doubtless he shall any cold stream of fountain engirdle his temple that he will s^eke with the fire of his infant virtue to dry up those undo overflow mervin courageous bid he take courage for there be no doubt of hard measure only say he it be convenient that I have a horse to run after you by which I may sustain you in the great danger sweet be thy word and reasonable answer Clarissa and forthwith command and a horse be deliver to mervin on which he mount and attend Clarissa o^ who spur be not spare till he come to the tiltyard when the lady virgin berea who be environ with her mother and the other lady behold the gallant young mervin enter into the list her heart dance in her crystal bosom as if not there but in he be her only paradise woe alas she love he dear who neglect she whole and often whisper to her soul so Mahomet will I will mervin to who only I be a prisoner who beauty only have surprise my affection be the son of some pagan potentate then will I follow he than will I be his handmaid then will I serve he than will I go with he but if he will espouse i o my soul how happy be my love in such a happy requital other than himself no goddess will wish for for poverty with he be rich than the palace of the great emperor in Turkey thus will the excellent berea often dispute with herself imagine mervin still the son of Barbin the merchant anon the tourney begin wher^ staff fly in the air like dust and dust like smoky ^^aves threaten the element at length a pagan fierce and strong run with his lance in his rest against Clarissa to who he give such a unkind blow that have not young mervin be he have tumble to the ground but the princely youth virtue sustain he yet so heavy be the encounter that Clarissa as much or more scare than wound return to his lodging where be disarm he lay that heavy complaint on fortune which just shall have be entitle to his own weaken mervin see he disarm his heart tickle and his blood fire with a emulation of honour which set a insatiate long on his thought to give some blow and to prove his body wherefore he fall upon his knee to Clarissa and say I beseech you fair prince for the honour of Mahomet bestow your arm upon i to the end I may go to the triumph and approve my wrength and here do I solemn protest that if I can encounter he who proud arm hatgh deign you this indignity to do my uttermost endeavour to humble he a low or low than the earth after Clarissa with astonishment have hear the young prince desire he willing accord to his wish yet so that mervin shall not accuse he but when the just be end if fortune make he conqueror he shall leave the honour not to himself but to Clarissa mervin to all most willing agree say further believe i prince I will do my best to gain the wealthy cup of the king which also you shall have for my desire be knowledge no honour at this Clarissa command his chamberlain to arm mervin with his own arm which he so secret do that the squire of Clarissa know it not when he be arm they bring he a most puissant and fierce courser on which he mount and so depart attend on by many squire who full imagine he to be their lord Clarissa who sleep in his chamber like a dromedary with his cowardice mervin who spur be honour and desire ride so speedy that in the end he enter the list where valiant he mean to win or conquer his fortune 2 in the end charge his lance he run like a whirlwind against he who have hurt Clarissa to who he give a requital blow with such puissance that he cast horse and man to the ground so furious as for fifteen day after he lie without motion then another pagan of his consort turn towards mervin on who he break his lance but mervin who take pleasure in that martial excercise behave himself with such virtue that with the truncheon which remain in his hand he give he such a counterbuff that break his heart in his bosom the pagan die instant in the place what shall I need to make a tedious discourse of a hasty conflict in brief mervin so courageous behave himself that ere his thought can be capable of rest with his break lance he throw ten to the ground of which not one ever rise again to the wondrous amazement of all the beholder then begin the cry of the multitude to exalt he think it have be Clarissa every one exclaim aloud Clarissa of Africa be he who ought only to be esteem at this exclamation a pagan on who helm all the day before honour sit twine her golden tress now envious that Clarissa have court his mistress swear by Mahomet he shall never enjoy her favour and forthwith prick towards mervin who have new recover a lance from one of his squire and turn his horse either encounter other with such a violent encounter that their staff fly into small piece sperse which piece shall first fly into heaven to report never like see vigour but for all the pagan force it be impossible to move mervin in his saddle who sit like a tower against a tempest or a rock against the rage of the sea fury but Meruins assault of a clean contrary nature lift the pagan up into the air with his lance and thence let he fall with such violence that he break his right arm and yet mervin break not his staff but with the same overthrow four more dead to the ground at this begin a great cry among the knight than before say Clarissa of Africa be only invincible and conquest herself be to he a handmaid then the king cause a retreat and the triumph to cease for so a king entreat and every one depart to his pavilion and mervin to his father house with the squire of Clarissa in who joy show the exceedingnesse of joy because their lord have gain the honour of the day but mervin make great haste to come to the chamber which he ascend in all secret manner for he have a exceed great care that Barbin shall not know any thing when he be come there Clarissa lie sole accompany with the chamberlain who before have deliver to Clarissa all what mervin have do he take he kind about the neck and kiss he say my honour crown and my life garland live ever in this circle of my arm as thou shall ever be in the compass of my heart for by thou be I renown in the court of king Mermont and exalt for most valiant through th^ pagan province many other speech he use of kindness all which mervin either excuse or requite to stand long on accomplement be tedious and tediousness weariness therefore in a word all the honour of the three day triumph and the cup of gold the reward of the victor be by the valour of mervin give to Clarissa as most wise and most valiant and he be receive by the king Mermont to bear in battle if any assail he the master banner of Mahomet so have unknown resolution exalt well know cowardice and though mervin in nothing be more careful then in secret keep this secret yet the most excellent virgin berea afterward attain the knowledge thereof by Clarissa chamberlain which alter serve mervin who as you have hear knightly begin and against Bau^mont continue with great marvel for he recover king mermount from his enemy but let we leave those high action till they fall more fit for our history and let we a little speak of Barbin who send mervin to traffic with another merchant name jacob and with Tyrus his son to who he give great mean for trade and four thousand pound which he ought another merchant in exchange of war^s he have before buy when jacob and the other merchant know mervin shall go with they they be unwoonted rejoice for he be dear belove of all man and say if Mahomet will but grant they safe conduct they doubt not but now to attain

altogether frequent the war tourneis and school of chivalry his name be crescent and he embrace as the only jewel of his life one only friend Brohars who he love exceed because he imagine the other love he as vehement which in troth be but falsehood and dissimulation for Brohars become mortal enamour with the wife of crescent insomuch as he make a vow to his own s^ule that unless destiny itself prevent he he will that forbid fruit which nature and the custom of divine law most vehement prohibit to further which irreligious oath a day happen wherein crescent go from his house in the city to a certain tower himself have new erect and the traitorous brohar take advantage of his absence enter his house where he find the lady who receive he kind because she show her husband love he dear and set his lust-inflamed self close by she as then accompany with virtuous imagination he with witty if witty may be impute to a act so unwitty and violent argument lay open the monstrous desire of his uncontrolled will which when the lady understand a sooth in the meaning of so bad a meaning she answer he it be against the law of hospitality to offer so hard amends for so great a merit his speech be as unfit and his desire frantic and for herowne part rather will she be dismember piecemeal then think that her thought shall think of any but her husband wherefore in conclusion she tell he if ever again his lip give leave to his tongue to tell she the like villainy she will give notice unto her husband who thenceforth shall not he for most inhuman while they be thus discourse stand by they one of the gentlewoman of the lady call Ysea who not seem to regard their parley well understand and hear all they have utter as well his monstrous assault as her modest defiance all which be to her a notable safeguard as hereafter shall appear when Brohars have receive this cold comfort to his accursed desire he leave the lady mighty perplex in heart and swear by Mahomet to bring to ruin both her

Brohars find crescent who do entertain he as kind as he love he dear and in discourse they waste the day till night with iron sceptre arrest all creature to rest at what time Brohars take leave of crescent and tell he that very early in the morning he be to use his presence in a urgent affair to which crescent say he be ever ready to perform the office of a friend and his will thus the false

than demand he a sword which be deliver he but he refuse it for be much too light whereupon go into her chamber from which she bring a sword big strong and massy this sword sometime have be the sword of king Brandifer a pagan who the renown knight Valentine nephew to king Pepin slay before Angoria present this sword to mervin who draw it and behold the beauteous brightness say o excellent engine worthy a invincible spirit add to i as much fortune as I will lend thou force and both of we will in the tongue of man be immortal now false traitor Brohars be as wise in defend thyself as thou be wilful in offend other else shall thy life waste with thy slander for mervin be arm as himself desire at that without the aid of his stirrup he mount on the back of Morbon and demand a lance which so soon as he have receive he put he with a princely majesty forward pass a swift strong and round career with such dexterity and nimbleness as breed wonder and commendation in all the beholder chief in the earl of Brandis that behold he from his palace say to his baron behold a noble and victorious warrior worthy to be adorn with a king diad^me his hand be a ornament for a lance and his p^rson a receptacle for all virtue with that come the pagan who go to arm himself and cry to mervin friend will you ^eave those measure and proportion jump which your horse in his come seem proud of and try the goodness of your arm by a sturdy encounter it be my desire and nothing else reply mervin so they retire back the one from the other to take their course with more violence the story say this encounter be on a goodly green plain before the earl palace who as before I say stand to behold they with he his wife and a gallant young prince his son and heir apparent when mervin and the other be sever more than the length of a good career they put spur to their courser and cowch their lance run with such terror that the ground tremble at the chide of their horse hoof and when they join in the shock the pagan shiver his lance close to his gauntlet yet no more stir the princely mervin than the gentele breath of air the strong pyramid in Egypt but meruines encounter bear death in his lance point for he strike his staff more than a foot and a half through the pagan body and pursue it with such vigour that he bear he headlong down dead unto the ground then stop his horse triumphant he say in himself even as he thus be overthrow overthrow I all the knight which run for the golden cup which clarissaes imagine valour enjoy what reason now can deny i knighthood none but will and that will be unjust merchandise farewell henceforth will I traffic nothing but honour 2 thus say young mervin grow proud of this late overthrow but when the pagan and the friend of the pagan which be slay see he pay nature last debt unto never satisfy death they all at once with one mad fury assail mervin which though it nothing appall yet at last it breed amaze in his sense till then unacquainted with tumultuous outrage but when his virtue be awake he say sith I be assault the defence I make offorce must be lawful and when he dr^w his sword with which he give such a blow to the brother of the slay pagan that he clause his skull to his tooth God of our forefather great Mahomet say mervin behold a excellent sword if I can but maintain strength to his edge the world shall chronicle i for a famous merchant but the extremity of the assault put mervin from further speech for the whole company assail he but be as wise as he be valiant he defend himself with unspeakable ver^ue and that in such sort that he slay more than a three part of they yet his foe hydra-like increase by kill have mighty endanger he if the other merchant and the two hundred pagan which have assemble to conduct he to Montesteur behold his instant peril have not take a oath to die in his su^^or but the count Brandis know this may arise to some grievous accident descend from his palace with five hundred horseman and come to the place where the fight be cry out to mervin and the rest by Mahomet my god he that su^ceaseth not but st^iketh another blow shall die the death at these word they all retire but mervin in the instant of the speech lay ^ixe dead at his foot 3 wherefore the count take a solemn vow he shall dear make vaunt of that day chivalry but run and catch mervin by the arm cry alas dear son this envious day in blood have drown all the hope of our good fortune forbear forbear for God sake do forbear for either must we fly or die for our misdoing then go towards the count and fall on her knee before he say for Mahomet sake for Mecca honour and thy own reputation most excellent prince take pity upon i and my poor innocent sister who through treason shall faultless consume in fire if within this three day she be not deliver by this happy now make unhappy young man when the earl see the constancy of her tear which issue from the true fountain of grief he accord to her desire with this condition that wheresoever mervin shall go he shall yet be his prisoner and that she shall deliver he sufficient hostage for his return whereupon deliver to the earl all the evidence bond and title whatsoever belong to she or her inheritance all which he detain till her back return to Brandis and thus be Meruins peace agree who mighty grieve that he shall be trouble or fight with for but only make proof of his body chap. 8 1. how mervin jacob Tyrus and the other merchant with the two hundred pagan depart from Brandis to deliver at Montesteur 2 and of the battle fight between mervin and brohar and the enent when have appease the tumult she depart from Brandis and with her mervin and the other merchant with they the band of two hundred pagan and the second day after they arrive at Montesteur where they find crescent madde-manlike torment with grief in his soul for the suppose monstrous indignity which the treason of brohar have root in his head against his constant and loyal wife when see he she go to meet he and he encounter her first give she this salutation fair sister quoth he thy sister have false betray the honour of my bed and give a immortal scandal to my name the deed be evident and apparent true the rather in this that none can find a knight who will undertake battle against Brohars to defend the justness of her cause wherefore if I live till to morrow and behold the sun bless the earth with his countenance I will see she burn according to the execution of our law brother crescent reply she fortune I hope have allot her star of much better influence and for her innocence I have bring one who shall defend it against Brohars and his treason who I hope to see at his hang as public aconuertite as ^e be now a monstrous false accuser at these word mervin who countenance do both apprehend and discharge a princely king of majesty stand forth and say unto crescent by the faith I owe unto Mahomet and my homage to distress lady I will voluntary and with a assurance of undoubted guiltiness enter battle against that false traitor who under my sword shall either public (@) his villainy or die for private conceal so worthy to be know a indignity s^arse have he finish these word but Brohars come throng into the press exclaim against all man that none d^rst encounter he and withal say brother crescent even the world and babe nor yet bear into the world will condemn thou for a wittolde and a wilful cuckold sith thus long thou de^errest the burn of that odious strumpet thy wife who implacable sin n^ne dare to make seem unfaultie when mervin hear Brohars he scratch his head and with a grisly look wherein virtue show herself more then impatient he say false bastard son of a most detestable whore who hateful speech augment the abomination of thy treason by Mahomet this day I will see thou hang for thy wrongful accuse and unjust slander of the virtuous brohar more than wound with meruines fiery point speech grow mad with wrath and draw his sword st^^cke at mervin but virtue ever awake to defend honour teach he how to ward the blow and with his fist well arm with a gauntlet he return brohar such a buffet that he make the ^lood gush from his ear and nostril say traitor behold the champion for the just lady Ba^ina who this day will make thy heart as sad as thy thought be false and neither by any to be match when crescent see the incomparable valour of mervin grow enamour of his virtue and say in himself believe i my soul my eye have not see a frame of youth so fair so big and in all part so excellent accomplish with all perfection by Mahomet have nature but adorn his chin with dowlne I shall have take he to be so much he resemble he Oger the renown christian who ^lew justament before Arius after these cogitation crescent come between mer^ine and brohar desire forbearance of their fury till the next morrow and say lord let prowess slumber till this next day sun awaken you to combat and then Mahomet give honour to he that have the right they both a^torded and then crescent demand pledge of both side for their appearance and pledge herself ^or mervin but Brohars can find neither baron knight nor squire who will be hostage for his faith wherefore crescent cause he to be imprison for that night in a strong tower whither be deliver all thing necessary for he or his hapless undertake action with all her train go and lodge in a castle hear by and take mervin jacob Tyrus and the other merchant with she who though they speak not much yet do their heavy countenance tell long tale of their tedious sorrow but mervin comfort they say Fear^ not my dear companion neither let your watery eye any long woe a evil fortune for by my faith my soul debt to Mahomet if you will pursue my step you shall no more be merchant but knight of regard and honour and then will we tread over the face of the earth and by redoubt fight ennoble and extol our law through all nation but one who name be brahan compact of the cold constitution a coward heart can be engender of reply sir mervin for my own part I love no honour with disturbance nor fame with a bloody forehead let they fight that be angry for my patience be eternal except it be against this pleasant cup of wine and that conflict may bode my overthrow but no wound at these word they all begin to laugh but who head at that instant be a parliament for grave matter go unto croysant and with a grave discontentment in which be figure a modest sufferance she desire leave for her sister Ba^ina to come and sup with they that the burden of her grief though they be not unlade yet they may by that recreation be a little ease he willing agree and so send the jailer to fetch she who instant do as he be command but when he come where the forsake lady be set and have unlock the two unkind embrace iron that fetter she he tell she of mervin and how her sister have bring he to fight against Brohars in defence of her honour alas say she how unfortunate be the unfortunatenes of my malicious fortune and how endless the spring of my teare before I weep because I want a champion now must I weep that have a champion I fear I want fortitude for Brohars be invincible and who then can conquer the never to be conquer here she sigh as if she have never before sig^^^ while the ^ailer (@) lady embrace comfort and be strong with a innocent hope for this day have Mern give Brohars such a unresistable blow as the blood spring out of his vein and run through his ear and nostril a notable prologue to a wish tragedy the poor lady hear this she give hope which before be banish leave once again to possess she and so rise and go with her keeper till she enter into the castle hall but when see her first appearance she run to embrace she and she albeit not with so much fury for sorrow have weaken her endeavour do the like and beiug both lock in each other infold ask her sister which be the champion who unspeakable virtue have vow once again to make her happy fair sister qd she look over all this assembly and he be thy new creator who be most high strong and most excellent furnish in all his lineament and yet so young that he have not attain to fifteen year and as she be thus speak mervin rise from the place where he sa^e ^o go comfort jacob who look be sad and uncomfortable and see he rise know by his proportion he only of that company be likely to redeem she wherefore she run unto he and fall on her knee she embrace his leg make offer to kiss his foot mervin repulse so much too divine homage and demand of she what she be excellent creature say she I be the woeful subject of unspeakable misery even that unhappy in protection of who innocence as I understand you be come to make hazard of your celestial honour and as it be pure so be the purity of my redemption wonderful in the eye of the beholder for by he that give my soul motion there be never move of unchaste thought within i what be aver against i the traitor false suggest because I true with stand his lascivious affection which he have not leave for the space of a year hourly to solicit my honour guard what dishonour will violate but rather shall a thousand flame dissolve i into cinder than breach of my wedlock faith congeal frosty damnation within i now the base slave slave to his (@) appetite come to be lodge by i neither know I nor can imagine a^d more to make my ignorance perpetual he slay he that by he may nothing be discover blameless be my thought albeit (@) fortune faulty if giltlesnes be any defence be then assure thou be invincible arm when mervin hear her word grace with a graceful delight of modest speak he recomfort she promise to die or behold her deliverance by this supper be serve up and they set down but yet jacob and the other merchant whisper one against another mighty repine at the forwardness of mervin for why their heart be create in a cold clime where the true sunshine of honour never shine by Mahomet say jacob if we pursue the humour of mervin we but run po^te after our death for say he win the honour of the field and release the lady yet if he escape with life and return to Brandis there shall he be imprison and for his late outrage adventure as great a hazard so that as his desire be boundless so shall his quarrel be endless and we for be his consort be disgrace he be much too courageous to win wealth by traffic and too mad to be praise under the title of a merchant thus they grind their tongue against their tooth with repine against mervin who all the while eat and drink without respect or heed take after supper they go to rest till the flight of bird give assurance of the sun presence and tell they it be morning then arise crescent cause the list to be prepare and 200. horseman to guard it in the midst whereof a stake be set up at which his wife shall be burn if mervin fail in the conflict then arise mervin and arm himself with all the royal accomplement his soul desire and be at all piece furnish he cause Morbon to be saddle and cover all over with a costly barb on who he leap and though Morbon for strength among horse be only excel yet his chine bend with the weight of the youngling then demand mervin his helmet which crescent deliver he and withal a mighty lance strong and till then untaught to skirmish mervin thus sit like a second Mars or a excel Perseus he make a solemn and religious vow to Mahomet ever after that to be so and in such manner and never more to use or inherit the trade or name of a merchant for qd he that trade abase a honourable disposition and bring slander to the sword and lance which ever shall be adore now be Brohars who before you hear to be imprison enfranchise and set at liberty immediate cause his attendant to arm he whilst his thought expostulate with fear his soul hold argument with doubtfulness yet be he a unmatchable knight for valour only treason the impoisoner of virtue have get habitation begin to stain resolution yet the story say that this brohar be brother to Geffray who Karahew slay in the battle before the wall of Babylon as be write in the history of Oger the father of meruive but in no pagan court dare Karahew ever after meet with Brohars as well for fear of his fortitude as for a general hate conceive against he for offer to have force rabion wife the son of Antifer but that which give Brohars the great title of dignity and make all man fear to encounter he in combat be for that he have fight xiiij-field all with the sword and prevail which ever after make he so fierce and proud of his fortune that he hold himself altogether invincible as if by a parliament of the god he alone be deify now be bring to he to mount upon a mare of his own which be dam to the good steed marchevall which Oger lose upon the sea her colour be not black but blackish (@) he get she of Baucamont king of Damas and she be (@) and make ready for the war to go assail Mermont in his city of mon^ment thence to win the fair princely virgin berea who Mermont have deny in marriage this mare which be bring Brohars be call Mordant fiery and courageous one quality of cruelty she have which be that no horse how strong or violent soe^er but she will instant strangle if there we^e not a more than usual regard have to her manner of fight brohars win she in a honourable combat and be mount thereon he take his target and hang it before his breast fasten a battle axe to his saddle po^ell and gripe in his strong arm a mighty lance thus accoutre he pace towards the field where mervin attend his come crescent still environ with jealousy and revenge have now fasten to the stake her executioner guard she with fire ready so assail the wood so soon as mervin shall be overthrow by this time be Brohars enter into the list on who when mervin have fix his eye and see the portly majesty of the princely beast that ^ore he I mean Mordant that gallant mare he fall mighty in love with she and take a vow in his own soul never again to esteem himself if that day conquest make he not true possessor of so high to be esteem treasure now the time summon a end to these great devoire a herald enter the list and after a solemn warning give by the sound of trumpet he pronounce this charge lord and knight belong to the noble lord crescent I strait charge and command you upon pain of death not to speak any word till the

r^^er the trial of their truth to fortune valour and their sword at these word the whole assembly of infinite silent and then the herald depart then en^ered crescent to the champion and first speak in this manner to Brohars by all the allegiance thou owe to thy earth sovereign by thy faith to Mahomet thy hope of conquest and thy spirit redemption I charge thou helm whether all thy assext^on and accusation avow against this lady my wife be tr^e I or no. noble crescent answer Brohars all be true by jupiter I swear and this day shall thou see that truth glorious by my conquest mervin hear he so obstinate desire crescent to desist from further speech for say he it be more than time the traitor have make his new recantation knight say crescent begin at your pleasure and this day let truth prevail 2 so depart he the list and the two combatant put down their beaver depart either from other a good distance to add more violence to their course and with a more than speak heart for fear have bind her lip to silence cry upon Mahomet to guard her champion and confound the false confounder of her honour now be they far enough asunder when turn their (@) and couch their lance they run against ^ch other with such swiftness that they overrun the wind which overrun all other move creature but in the sho^k when their lance feel honour seal upon their curate mervin stroke Brohars so hard worthy a better name than that by which force be entitle that he tumble he from the back of his good mare to the ground and on the other part he likewise assail mervin so courageous that both horse and man equal kiss the earth together but mervin be quick and nimble and never more quick then in the quickness of extremity quick gate up unamazed but Brohars astonish with fall from a beast so high and lofty arise though not so well yet as well as he co^ld and draw his sword come to assault mervin who cry un^o he traitor this deed this day shall make thou act a sorry tragedy brohars envious angry at these word of mervin strike at he with almost a more than divine courage but he perceive the blow retire a little and take it upon his target yet it come from so violent a arm that it cleave it down to the ground cut withal the spur from his right foot and the sword unsatisfied enter into the ground more than afoot and a half who greediness to conquer hinder his conquer for he can not recover it again but with much pain take mervin die to die in debt of so good payment lift up his sword and strike the traitor on the^helmet from whence the sword slide descend on his thigh and there cut away a collop sufficient enough to gorge a falcon two day together and better now be mere then time for Brohars to change his foot for the weight of this blow give his hinder leg pre-eminence to be better and strong to his intolerable grief and fury make he rail on maho. for suffer he thus of a boy to be mate mervin in who valour hold her residence and of who virtue be only enamour bear sword point blank with the pagan eye run furious against he and in his course say Brohars the execreable treason that damn thou have suggest shall end thy life before the day shall end his light else shall my reputation die in his infancy and truth hereafter never be account the innocent protectress and with that he strike a blow which the pagan receive on his target with such violence that it enter in a unimagined way mervin by no mean can pluck it out again though with sundry twiche he give he almost pull it from the pagan neck Brohars not unexperienced in any advantage occasion can offer in the extreme of those conflict watch with a greedy deliverance of mischief in his head and when he perceive mervin pull with all his sw^y he let the target ^lip out of his hand so that mervin with his own force fall backward to the ground on who immediate the traitor lea^ed think then to finish the end of all his wish all the baron that behold this infortunate misadventure murmur among themselves and say what pity be this that fortune not (@) shall be the overthrew of virtue and that this youth unconquered shall not be conqueror who heart dance lively on the sword of mervin when she see this stour bode evil grow mad with grie^e that grief power hold she from be mad and whisper to herself ha Mahomet thou which be adore in our pan^heous if thou thus give our virtue and leave this excel creature to be slay by a miscreant for ever will I abjure thy deity raze thy temple and ere the sun go down be baptize a christian. while thus her waver thought amongst themselves hold a civil dissension poor her torment exceed the bound of torment be run a degree beyond the coast of illness so that what other in their private self lament she with loud shriek cry and clamour public note insomuch that the echo of her lamentation pierce into the ear of mervin as he lay conduct a honourable shame with they to his heart so that gather a better strength then that which be strength name by vigour of his spirit he turn brohars topsy-turvy under he by this time meruines horse who through the cruelty of his fall can no soon get up arise which Mordant the ma^e perceive come and assail he so that between the beast begin a cruel and fierce battle but in the end Mordant strangle the good Morbon to the small delight of mervin who at that instant be bu^^ed from intend any remedy so long do mervin remain upon the traitor that the whole company be in admiration at his endurance but when he perceive all mean of release banish and that no power he have have power to overturn mervin he say unto he mervin

which issue from his wound have already call the earth where he lie in a scarlet mantel^ as if he already have make it judge of his life or destruction now have each of they take their weapon according to their agreement but Brohars as if his heart whole dwell on the edge of his weapon have the axe in his hand (@) it into the air and cry to mervin this day boy shall be thy life last day unless thou swear and maintain that all the article be true which I have impose against the wife of crescent which if thou do we will no more be foe but companion and like man invincible measure the earth and conquer great Charles of France who only p^rsecuteth ou^ law and religion gild tongue traitor say mervin little shall I please Mahomet to be treacherous mind less to be the companion of ^o base a miscreant wherefore I esteem both odious after this speech they assaild^^h other on every side where there advantage lay most apparent and that in such vehement sort and so tedious that they both become so exceed weary as they be fain for a time to repose themselves after they have a while rest themselves Meruin^ call to Brohars and say traitor this rest be the last sabbath of thy life for thou have wrongful accuse yonder innocent la^y and therefore ere the evenings eye shut in the day thou shall die most miserably^ sorrow at this reproof so stop up the speech of Brohars that he only gnashd his tooth and mount his keen edge axe he strike such a blow and with so great might on the helmet of mervin that if the great of divine power have not preserve he and that the ^emper and the live be both more than extraordinary that day have ^in the last of his life and fortune notwithstanding all the favour of his staff so strong a poise issue from the blow fall that mervin be force to fall upon his knee yet be he soon remount and as wise in danger as valiant in his fight raise his good sword strike the traitor with such puissance on his helmet that if Brohars have not turn back he have cleave he to the shoulder the sword in his stumble fall on the thigh of the pagan so as he quite dissever it from his body and with that throw the traitor unto the ground who with the grief of the blow cry that the echo of his clamour be hear afar off at this heart dance in her body for joy so do in who be a equal sympathy and all the baron that hold either of the lady in regard triumph say amoug themselves no eye have see fortitude accompany with such true fierceness in any knight as in this young youth unconquerable mervin such speech speak every one of he but the traitor Brohars who have then lose a leg take his axe into both his hand say boy braggart and worse than a boyish braggart stand but before i and thou shall see this loss the gain of my better courage for I shall never

improvidence guide his action for the traitor clasp he about his helmet draw he to he with such main strength as he fellover and over great God of heaven have mercy upon he for if thy pity be not his saviour death must be his redeemer brohars be mighty and strong and so be mervin insomuch that between they be ^hewed all the triumph and perfection of strength and agility but in the end Brohars through the riverlike effusion of his blood be so exceed weaken that in a happy time and in despite of fortune worst mervin arise take from he his battle axe then hover over he like a ungorged eagle he say traitor now behold the last date of thy affliction confess therefore the treason thou have do against the good lady or by Mahomet thy own weapon immediate shall divorce thy accursed head from thy shoulder but he who villante have teach nothing but villainous reply answer thou son of a defame courtesan coward recreant I be never traitor nor do treason ever lodge in my affinity as he be about to say more mervin impatient to see such audacious impiety with the axe give he such a blow on other thigh tha^ he cut it quite from his body leave he as leglesse as he be graceless the pain whereof together with the labour of his life departure make he bellow out such lamentation that all the mountain and plain be privy to his miserable fortune then call he to mervin and say eu^n now I

ease to his sore travel limb he demand of his wife if not any from the court have make inquiry of his return and h^s wife tell he yes a squire who as she imagine belong to the beautiful princess berea therefore she persuade he as a thing not unnecessary forthwith to go thither and to take with he from she to th^ princess a most curious wrought purse which of self purpose she have make for she small

Mahomet confound his enemy who weapon maintain war against he then he proceed thus in his ambassage king Mermont the king my master salute thou by we and say he wonder whither thy ancient wisdom be flee that thou refuse to give he thy fair chaste daughter who every excellence the height of his royal dignity shall counterpoise therefore these be his late summons either now send she by we to make happy his desire or hereafter it will be too late to repent thy life end end thy glory if then now thou will stoop the ambition of thy will send she with a free consent the marriage without delay shall be solemnize and all his royal army shall depart without damage to thy country 2 when Mermont with a often exchange cheek have hear his delivery choleric anger rouse up his lion spirit teach his brow such frown of displeasure that Morgant quake to behold they then say Mermont take those insolent orator of disgrace and cast they into some hideous undiscover dungeon for that be both my reply and resolution where in despite of Baucamont their woe shall consume their breath at these word they be each one on every side have nothing to say for themselves but prayer to Mahomet for their protection take and cast in most loathsome imprisonment where their day be blackness and the breath they ^rew the air of their sigh before breathe 3 after this the king Mermont cause a alarm to be cry

his extreme cowardice not the world can have make he hazard his honour in so weak hand or his imagine reputation be but the steal shadow of meruines perfection now Clarissa wound to death with his own glory have no succour to fly unto but his chamberlain that only be privy to what pass betwixt mervin and he who at ^hat instant lie exceed si^ke of a quartane fever wherefore come to he Clarissa say

say the chamberlain who even then be piteous ague shake be all the golden mine of the world propose to i for recompense it be impossible to raise i because in my body want vital ability when Clarissa hear he he strike he with so fierce a coward blow that two of his tooth fly out of his mouth and then depart out of the chamber in great choler and come to king Mermont who he entreat with all the speed he can to give a alarm to the tent of his enemy who as yet secure dream of no danger and by that surprise doubt not but to attain infinite renown and these word be utter with such a tremble

Constantinople at such time as the truce be make by Charlemagne and his twelve peer there be also with this Galen Rotherus another knight the remembrance of who virtue might exceed well equal the most praiseworthy reputation he have to name drohe who after that time become friend to mervin as shall be full mention in this present history behold now these christian chase by the unmerciful fury of a violent storm arrive near ^nto mervin who first perceive they cry to his companion this day be better than a sabbath to my desire for I discover a ship lade with Christian gallant if it be rich be you the profit of their wealth vouchsafe i no booty but prowess and honour to my sword which be all I desire to deserve and at these word a courageous fire of valiant fury environ his heart now if the zealous mind christian when they behold the pagan be overrun wieh a doubtful fear of their success wonder not for they be but thirtie^ and those ill appoint both for armour and munition so that if the eye of heaven behold they not with a pity aspect their life and honour be all in jeopardy by the valiancy of mervin cousin Gallien say drohe behold how these pagan draw near to assault we if jehovah look not from heaven he^e shall our life pay their last forf^t fear not cousin reply Gallien for by that faith I owe to th^lmightie so long as I can hold my battle axe in my hand so long will I maintain my liberty and doubt not but to send thousand of they to hell ha co^ine against the foe of religion we ought to be eternaly valiant yet if God in his great book of destiny have set down our tragedy in this conflict let we receive with joyfulness what we can repel with unwillingness yet I protest to you by the great protestation of a Christian soul that before I be take I will enfranchise so many pagan^ soul from their curse body that the cr^mosin cur^ents of their blood shall vouchsafe my hand a perpetual coverture while Gallien be speak this mervin and his companion be already prepare for the battle board Gallien to who mervin ha^led and demand whence and what they be who white cros^es be say he the sign of christianity which he have vow to root from the face of all nation scarce be his last wordend but the pagan mariner assault the christian who mervin and the rest with their sword in their fist violent second make almost the beginning and end one moment there may the eye of man behold a lamentable spectacle for of 30 christian soul in a trice be 26 breathless only 4 survive which be Gallien drohe and 2 other which breathe scarce a breath before their breath vanish but drohe turn aloft his steelehew sword which the count of meulant have give he when he fight against Sodonas slay a infinite number of the valiant sarazen but Gallien carry himself so courageous that he never strike blow with his axe but he dissever the life from the body when crescent see the prowess of Gallien he cry unto his people that they shall not for a world kill he because he will present he as a great estimate to king Mermont but that word of life safety cost he more by much than he desire to tender for Gallien smite so thick with his axe that the pagan in abundance tumble into the sea Gallien still cry s. George and i and withal cry thou holy lamb of juda comfort thy people all this while the valiant act of mervin the son of Oger do be wonder beyond wonder and more than word have power to deliver yet what he do he ill do sith it be to exalt Mahomet and show himself a invincible pagan yet ought he not be hate for his misbelief but curse with immortal malediction that false fairy Gratiana who steal he tell not the truth of his birth and be Gallien and Drohes make great resistance against the pagan but the high valour be profitless against a high resolution wherefore cousin drohe say Gallien let i kiss thou and bid thou farewell for here shall our body unsundered sunder their acquaintance but our soul I hope embrace in the high palace of heaven well do thou know o that we have such cause to know how Ganelon the traitor by his treason deliver unto the king Marcillius my father Oliver and the famous Orlando who die at Roncevalli o Oliver my father thou scourge of sarazen turn back into

conquest great thy fault for such conquest and great now shall be thy overthrow yet for thy valour sake I will contradict my judgement yield and thy life be save be it not for charity say Gallien I shall hate thy soul but thy body be assure I detest yet myself much more shall I have but half a thought of submission never be there pagan bear to who I will be obedient and at that word he strike a pagan that approach he with such fury that he fall dead before Mernin mer^in behold this true magnanimity have not even at that instant wrath thrust pity from her sovereignty he have both save and love he but be blind with emulation he rush upon Gallien and strike he upon the head that he cleave he even unto the girdle woe alas Gallien the son of Oliver as memorable for his virtue as famous for his victory be now slay forgive he great jove that slay he and yet it be a wound that wound all Christendom 2 now be drohe alone and yet not alone for see Gallien dead he be consort with infinite perplexity and as it be arm with their invisible tumult he swear that before he die he will revenge his death than fly he among the proud saracen send infinite to attend he who he love but alas their course be contrary for Gallien ascend they descend so like a careless mad man only discreet wise in the way of prowess do drohe behave himself that leave his own he board the ship where the pagan be inhause and there defend and offend with such unspeakable courage that not any but start back and refuse to assail he jesus say drohe that make the cross glorious by thy passion shall I o must I die here and thus unrevenged with that word he leap into a little boat that be behind at the st^rn of the ship and swear by holy Mary that who so enter there he will be his death man for sithence he be alone he will sell his own and his fellow life at the rate of a bloody tribute then come mervin all amaze say christian for pure love only of thy virtue if thou will yield and trust my honourable

to himself by that celestial virgin who bear the fruit of life it be better to be in prison and prolong life with some hope then present die and the soul unsatisfied then raise his voice aloft noble pagan qd he to mervin on these condition that neither my life be violate nor I urge to deny my religion I yield myself Christian qd mervin I assure it thou then drohe deliver up his sword and mervin

who be yield my prisoner and to who by warranty my reputation be engage with that mervin lift up drohe sword be naked in his hand and strike the pagan that he cleave he to the tooth then amplify his protestation say by Mahomet if there be any man of what estate soever that impeach my promise or do my word wrong to any Christian this hand and this sword shall minister revenge for all my deed shall be just and religious o immortal creator say drohe to himself how well worthy be this pagan to rule a monarchy I have not see a creature more wise gracious nor more valiant o thou that dispose all

drohe of mervin be but the first sacrifice of a great love which ensue now come Barbin to mervin say my belove son too strong a a witness be this blow of thy heavy displeasure I pray thou of love give not to thy follower matter of indignation as you have do to he you have slay father qd mervin dissimulation be a branch of cowardice I will be plain and just if the great monarch under heaven wrong i

mervin withdraw himself into his cabin only make himself rich with heap to himself infinite wish to behold and enjoy the most admirable berea and in these cogitation he sail with such prosperous success that in few day they arrive at the port Luternia where they land two league from the host of king Baucamont who as you have hear have besiege Mermont within montment with two hundred thousand

Baucamont such a blow that he fall from his courser to the ground neither have he ever raise his head from the earth pillow have not a band of 4000 come in to his rescue betwixt he and they a singular to a infinite plural begin a fierce doubtful and undying combat jacob this while the good merchant valiant behave himself so also do crescent and Barbin who sword bare livery of their lord wage yet when I think on mervin and drohe the deed of the other be but as margin note to their h^ge volume there may one see confusion in her royalty head without hand hand without body leg without foot thigh like foot move there you may see stone break with body burden yea burden body by stone break all thing horrible yet nothing but honourable there lay pagan slay on pagan misbelief on unbelieved while drohe smile to see self religion self discipline and law confound one another and begin to pride himself that that day his deed shall be eternize but at this time what mervin do be impossible to describe because they ascend high than mortal capacity he encounter africant and slay he so do he the admiral who horse and man he bear down to the ground what shall I say more all force be no force when his force gainestood it as hare from drun^s lamb from lion fawn from tiger so fly the pagan before he what he do what his power seek to do be all this while behold both by berea and her mother who stand next she and from the tickle spirit of her heart say to her daughter fair soul see thou not yonder pagan who arm be like sun shine and his deed better than the sun beauty in his helm he wear

be he alone that so gallant behave himself to the wonder of all man o how with that imagination love give new fire to his old flame and surprise she with delicate think then grow she dumb with admire sigh because she be dumb blush to hear herself sigh and then grow pale lest her dumbne sigh and blush shall of other than her own eye be perceive after this war of maiden look have take little truce with her intention thus to her heart her heart whisper thou God of my forefather how excellent have thou make my love death be most fierce fear be become his vassal attend he death but touch he not as

torment of such vehemency take hold on i as no creature can imagine Mahomet defend my father for I fear some evil thus dissemble she with her mother mervin be the lodestar by which all her lodging be guide all this while fall destruction from the sword of mervin upon the pagan who like lark under the wing of a hobby seek hole in the earth to hide they drohe pursue his footstep and the near of any imitate his virtue now be Baucamont remount once more and pass through his rank give they new encouragement revile the new come stranger and disable their action though his wound bare bleed witness of their worth 5 when he have do he charge afresh upon Mermont and that with such impregnable violence as he overthrow he horse and man to the ground but with nimble agility he soon recover his foot and draw his sword brandish it for his defence all that show of magnanimity have but little avail to his profit if mervin have not again by chance come to his rescue who cry aloud Mermont my king defer thy fortune but a moment and I will yield succour to thy life and then rush among the thick he strike Gyrion on the head cleave he to the waste after he the next and the next spare none that be within his encounter when Baucamont see death and destiny lie in Meruins sword like a man make desperate because his estate be desperate he join himself to mervin strike so violent a blow as he cleave insunder the crest of his helmet but to his head do no harm but amazement mervin displease at his entertainment draw his sword and without o^her salutation stroke at Baucamont withal his puissance the pagan king fear the blow retire little yet have he never breathe any more malice if the sword have not turn in the hand of mervin which like a thunderbolt fall on the arm of Baucamont and that in such heavy manner that the armour shoulder and all be cut asunder when mervin see he thus spoil of his defender in jest manner he say king Baucamont it be time now the world excuse you from these martial occurrent sith the fit for you be a monastical function say henceforth for the love of Mahomet you will abjure your folly have pay to this good king your right arm for a ransom thus have say he return to Mermont and remount he the second time but Mermont in who be engraft a strong belief that mer^ine be Mahomet with prostrate humbleness say unto he great and almighty God of most excellent authoirtie this day have thy goodness new create i and make my life more happy than the life of my forefather henceforth be gracious to my proceed great lord of our religion and I will make thy name be ring through all natious thy temple I will multiply and all thy ornament shall be of pure silver mervin see the blindness of his amazement raise he from his prostracie say no but you be deceive you be deceive I honour he and you and with that he rush again into the battle thus while drohe and the other behave themselves valiant effect such feat of knightly chivalry that force perforce they drive to retreat the host of Baucamont many fly none abide till the mighty king esclamart cause all his troop which come for the succour of Baucamont be 10000 saracen all fresh and unfoil have as yet not strike one blow to turn upon their enemy like a storm beget by a storm in the month of April when Mermont perceive they and consider his people and horse be weary unable to withstand they be fresh cause a retreat to be sound and in honourable s^rt retire into the city but when he come to enter esclamart and his man be swift and nimble have gain the port have not mervin and drohe withstand they who march behind and mervin in that last encounter slay the nephew of esclamart with many other pagan and they so well defend themselves that king Mermont and his host enter into the city and mervin and drohe after they to the confusion and dishonour of esclamart who return sorrowful for his nephew slaughter who he cause to be bring with great solemnity into his tent vow to Mahomet his god revenge for his misfortune chap. 15 1 of the honour Mermont do to mervin 2 me^uine make chamberlain of the court. 3 Gratiana for his sake make lady of the chamber of berea with other accident king Mermont and all his knight be enter into montment be most royal receive both of the queen his wife and the most beautiful lady berea his daughter to who he say thou golden planet of my age my dear daughter I beseech thou honour with all the excellency thou can imagine this admirable creature who sit arm and mount on this mighty mare I once imagine he to be our great god Mahomet so godlike be he in my understanding and so impossible it be for the force of man to enterprise what he have effect when jacob come and hear the king speech pleasant he reply my gracious sovereign it be a common say that a fool bolt sometime as well hit the mark as the wise man arrow true say the king but I pray thou to what end do thou cite this adage to this my liege lord answer he I who be base unworthy to counsel king yet ancient experience in war doubtfulness go in your majesty name to Brandis and thence bring this mervin the son of Barbin who this day by his most celestial prowess have twice preserve you from death and the dangerous hand of your enemy now if the actor be worthy his honour be not the agent for the act worthy to be reward else let my fortune refuse i say the king jacob I will heap wealth upon thy wealth and on mervin I will double a thousand honour of knighthood for by Mahomet I imagine he to have be Mahomet so far excel he all creature yea even Bruhier and justament his valiant brother who be slay by that renown Oger the scourge of our religion o mervin if Mahomet continue gracious to thy proceed our law shall be by thou exalt as much above christianity as the first mover be resident above the earth centre woe alas this prohesie be too true for with the eye of infant shall be water with tear as hereafter shall be declare now Mermont look upon drohe ask jacob what he be and jacob in every point describe he both their meeting conflict and conquest and how he be a Christian who name be drohe add withal that if any miracle can make he renounce his religion that then the law of paganism by he more than by any Christian but Oger will be raise and admire but this wisdom be so great that no will can remove he then Mermont ask jacob from whence and by what mean mervin have get that band of man which he have bring to the battle then jacob show the king crescent who then be busy in talk with mervin and from point to point declare his fortune both how ^a be accuse mervin engage Brohars slay and crescent restore from his unbelieving the king hear all this his heart dance for joy and he solemn vow to raise mervin high in authority than the conceit of man can aspire unto whereupon call the gallant young knight before he who come with all the reverence belong to so great a majesty the king with a dumb but speak countenance amaze as if in a manner scare at his beauty and with his long look and intimate search in every lineament of his proportion he sudden apprehend in his memory the divine feature of Oger wherefore he say believe i mervin by that Alcheron in which I trust thou resemble both in body figure and beauty the famous of all christian renown Oger the duke of Denmark who fortune if thou countervail the pen of all man shall write thou

Baucamont with 800 of his approve warrior be intend to hunt the stag in the great forest border upon the city as soon as mervin hear it he call drohe the traitor marant and 500 expert soldier and with they privy issue out of the city take a usual path through which he pace so long till at length he perceive where Baucamont with his host return from the chase his arm as then heal and he mount on his steed mervin ambush himself and his man within a little grove whence he intend to charge Baucamont hold both his lance ready in his fist and have under he his mare Mordant anon when Baucamont be approach so near that he be hopeless of retire mervin cause his man to march against he say fellow in arm think not of fortune but victory for in myself there be no other imagination chap. 16 1 how Baucamont and 800 soldier be discomfit and himself take prisoner 2 with he the king Antifer and 24. pagan all by mervin 3 how he deliver they to the traitor marant to present to king merm^nt his uncle in Meruins name the conqueror when Baucamont behold mervin who he know by his helmet because in many battle which I leave to speak of he have take notice of the same he turn to his train use these speech you follower of i and my fortune revive yourselves and in the name of Mahomet be now or never courageous battel^ sure we shall be offer be fortune as auspicious as please she for behold a enemy who my soul hate even he who single sword do i more hurt than Mermont or his huge host can have effect by a godlike encouragement yet be he no other than the base son of a ware-exchanging merchant who some devil have nurse for a damn execution at this word he take a tell axe in his hand and broach Marcheval with his spur charge courageous mervin on the other side as nimble as lightning run to entertain he their run meeting and conjunction be loud than thunder and strong than a northern tempest and when in midst of the assembly they have discharge upon either other the wonder of chivalry mervin have break his lance draw his sword and therewith assail Baucamont with such fury that he throw he from Marcheval his gallant beast to the ground and that with such incomparable prowess that he lie a long time on the ground in a deadly passion mervin descend unlace his helmet and be even ready to divide the long conjunction betwixt his head and body when Baucamont awake from his trance and behold himself utter exile from the hope of long live with erect hand cry unto he thou flower of chivalry and the bed-mate to fortune be as honourable as thou be valiant and take i to thy presence then turn his sword in his hand he deliver the hilt to mervin who perceive it deliver he unto the traitor marrant say prince marrant take king Baucamont to your charge and guard he safe because I know the king your uncle will esteem this fortune much better than the gift of a empire marrant accept he joyful this while drohe and the rest be in the midst of their enemy where the deed they do be worthy of immortal memory now after mervin have lef^ his royal prisoner in safe keep he fling himself into the heart of the battle like a hunger-starved wolf amongst a flock of sheep the first he meet he strike dead to the ground so do he the second the three the four and the five why shall I be tedious in description ten to their death he send with one breathe drohe see he do these excellent feat of knighthood grow enamour of he and praise he in his heart next his creator but God of heaven say he how wonderful beyond conceit be these action if his thread of life lengthen like his courage and some pitti powder of heaven alter not his unhappy misbelieve all Christendom shall quake and the house of David be forsake thus from the anguish of his soul speak the most righteous drohe who valour and feat of arm be boundeoo in no limit augment hourly the rather to behold the example of mervin lay before he 2. all this while be the son of religious Oger furroy through the midst of the army and have even now overthrow king Antifer to the ground who head have pay his ransom if fearful humbleness have not make he submit to mercy he likewise he give to the keep of marant now have drohe encounter a giantlike pagan with who he maintain a dreadful battle but in the end he smite he a blow with such vigour that he cleave his head to his tooth which another pagan behold run at drohe and with his lance strike his horse through the heart that he fall down dead at the instant but with great agility drohe recover himself and flourish his sword vow vengeance for his injury but mervin see the pagan by such dishonour have slay the horse of drohe prevent his intent and with one blow strike the pagan head from his shoulder as this be in do the gallant horse marchevall come gallop masterless by they run here and there have his reins at his own random when mervin see he he thrust his spur against Mordant and fly after he and that with such voilent swiftness that in short time he take he and deliver he to drohe who be mount thereon swear by he that with blood wash the world from her transgression that if ever meruines fortune stand in need of his employment his life shall be wa^ted in his service then again drohe thrust himself into the midst of his enemy of who he make infinite destruction that both pen and wit be too blunt to describe they and yet be they to be join with mervin in no degree of comparison no more than the night to the day glory for he never lift his sword aloft but he kill either horse or man or both horse and man together let i not dull your ear with a heavy tale such excellent feat of arm be perform by mervin that of 800. which go with their king on hunt there be leave alive but twenty and four which with baucamout and Antifer be likewise take prisoner great be the booty and riches which there be take but mervin refuse to touch it cause it to be equal divide among his soldier then command a retreat and summon his band together they march in soldier like manner to montment but among the rest a pagan who name be Hebie thrust spur to his horse and post from the troop with such swiftness that he run to montment before the rest a long season assoon as he be light he ascend the palace and kneel before the king he say my dread sovereign more ought you to adore our god Mahomet and great incense to throw upon his altar than any monarch whatsoever for mervin this day by his never fail prowess bring bind in triumph Baucamont and twenty four of the most courageous pagan take all prisoner by his only sword when the paragon of all age divine berea hear this if her joy exceed her beauty and yet than her beauty be nothing more amiable let no man wonder nor demand the reason si^h love be beyond the bond of a large limit 3 now while the king and his noble be increase their conceit of pleasure with imagination of these adventure the prince marant with Baucamont and the ^4 pagan enter into the hall and kneel before the king with a stiff knee faint as unwilling his tongue shall be guilty of any virtue he utter these speech fair uncle and my liege lord high may you if you please honour me^uine your great chamberlain who renown prowess and true valour have take these mighteous prisoner in who name and with all humble reverence I present they to your majesty assure you the deed he have this day do be more than the wise have power to describe or the strong force to countervail then whisper his malice to his own soul he say mervin these praise which in give I have give my own desire the lie I will short heap upon thou with a eternal vengeance now heaven that save all thing save the renown mervin against who the thunderbolt of private envy threaten destruction when Mermont behold Baucamont Antifer and the other prisoner his joy exceed in greatness his kingdom and he repeat the wrong their unlawful army have beget in his country threaten a requital for these indignity but Baucamont regardless of all mistrust fortune without any amazement in his countenance make a petition to Mermont that all the twenty four prisoner may be deliver only himself and Antifer detain for the satisfaction which if it will please he to vouchsafe they will restore he recompense for all the indmagement they or their war have procure and that their mighty army as yet not whole vanquish shall return to damas. upon these article the king conclude so the 24. be enfranchise and with they also the two imprison ambassador of Baucamont to wit Morgant and nygron who as then have be prisoner the space of a whole year during which time the war have continue now when they be return back to their tent they find the king esclamart mighty perplex with sorrow for the take of Baucamont and Antifer his brother yet notwithstanding they tell he the condition of compromise agree upon between the king of each party upon which report he make proclamation for the raise of his tent and leave the siege in perfect manner depart without further trouble to Mermont or his country and betake himself to the sea sail so prosperous that in short time they arrive at Damascus where they report to the state their unhappy occurrent which have befall they thus will we leave they to the sorrow of forsake subject and return unto king Mermont who joy be the great of all joy to see himself hold in his subjection Baucamont and Antifer two of the great king of all Asia who he have swear upon Alcheron and a king majesty that they shall not pretend any flight or escape without his royal will and licence all this while be mervin in the court no less honour exalt and admire of the king the queen and the noble than of the base vassal live by the grace of his favour the reason because as he be valiant majestical and invincible so be he sweet courteous affable and pleasant in the eye of all creature yet marrant in who heart envy have build she a black sepulchre increase his malice and hate he the more because no man else hate he thus be great with child of damnable imagination he grow thoughtful and sick how he shall be deliver anon he bethink himself there be no so ready mean to heap ruin on the rich day of Merui^es prosperity as to come to the true understanding of the love between he and berea wherefore to that mark he aim all his thought but yet his leavell carry he far away and his labour in that point be utter frustrate as you shall hear in the next chapter chap. 17 of the private discourse between marant and be^ea and of her answer 2. how she come to the understanding of marants envy to

for he strike not any pagan but he sever the life from the body Isaiah the king of juda see Bertran thus courageous thrust himself against he but there be mighty folly in his work for Bertran meet he in the midst of his carrier with such a blow that he cleave his head to his collar o Mahomet say esclamart this Christian be possess with some devil what mischief he do i and then he cry to all his soldier promise prize of great worth to he that can take he then be the famous gallant assail on every side but like a enrage boar he range among they and in such sort defend himself that the pagan like lark fall under the hovering of his wing but yet alas all his prowess have profit he but little and he be at the point of take or kill when thyery and florion his brother with Huon of Bordeaux with divors christian by great chance come to his rescue brother Bertran say Florion now or never remember who you be and banish the fear of a pagan infidel and with that word he thrust into the press overturn and kill all that stand between he and his brother when Bertran see he he take new courage and like a lion rouse himself with great fury in so much that he strike esclamart to the earth who Florion like a gripe seize upon and deliver he to two stout christian who bear he to their tent then begin the battle hydra-like to renew in which the pagan die without number for who soever Bertran touch never more stand need of the physician on the other side his brother guion do wonder who encounter a king name afriquant who be exceed strong and valiant he guion overthrow to the ground but a band of saracen despite his head mount he again and assail guion in cruel manner but like a wise and valiant knight he defend himself from their fury then come Huon of Bordeaux who like a valiant knight of unspeakable virtue ^lew infinite troop of the pagan but when he see young guion in hazard he turn unto he and in a moment deliver he from the sword of ^hose miscreant at all this the battle weaken no deal yet may you have see as many knight lie dead on the earth as star in a winter night shine in the heaven and so many masterless horse post about the field as atomy play in the sun beauty yea so valiant our christian bear themselves in that conflict that in the end the pagan be discomfit as you shall hear hereafter chap. 21 1 how florion the young brother be take prisoner by k. 2 how the pagan be overthrow 3 how Florion be give in exchange for king Goham gaifier brother and other adventure mighty be the s^urre and most dreadful the battle in which our christian show the renown of their valiancy but above all the price of victory seize on the helmet of Bertran for the number which he slay be account numberless even the young of the brother most delicate Florion do that day marvelous act who behold a pagan in his presence to kill a Christian swear devout his hand shall be his revenge but the pagan fly before he thrust himself to a battalion of saracen where Florion overtake he slay he in his entrance but evil befall that chance to the young gallant who imagine to return find himself enclose on every side with the power of king which they be twenty thousand pagan all with one violence they lay siege against Florion but prevail nothing against he until by a evil misfortune they kill his horse who in his fall fall upon he by which mean and no other they take he prisoner and send he to Damascus then bring his army into the heart of the battle with who sight it recover new life become sharp than at the beginning 2 yet be Bertra^ so fear among the pagan that not any dare stand before he but if any by chance do they never after be behold to their surgeon so mighty and invincible be his force that day that by he king Goham the brother of gaifier be take prisoner who he command to be bring to his tent not far from ^im his brother guion like a demie-god of arm encourage his soldier charge they for the honour of I^sus Christ and his dear passion that day to be invincible for though the pagan be infinite yet their flight be shameful to this renown guion belong a squire who name be regnier the son of his sister who with a battell-ax which he hold strike a pagan name tufier thwart the helmet with such virtue that he c^aue his head to his shoulder when guion see the mightiness of his blow he go unto he and embrace he give he the second order of knighthood say thou branch of the stock from whence I be descend continue thy magnanimity and by that honour to which I covet to aspire I will make thou the commander of a town or a stately castle even in his great mightiness be the battle when Bandus have join his army with the other there may you have see so many lose head so many forsake body so many overthrow knight so many unbckt horse who trail their bridle under they ^^ode their master to piece that since the lamb of glory be shadow under the spotless womb of a virgin the like have not be see nor hear tell of nor that so great resistance can be make by so few as our poor christian for the pagan be in number one hundred thousand and more but our christian by their valour lest but ten thousand which be not slay or take the king Bandus be in the midst of the Christian army of who he make mighty destruction among who he thrust one noble christ^an to the heart and after he like a wolf in a flock send a number to follow he on the other side of the field be Bertran triumphant with victory range to seek his brother two of they he quick find out who be joyful to behold their conquest brother say Bertran where be Florion I know not quoth guyon it be convenient that we go seek he then put they themselves into the battle to search he out but can not find he and there be reason for he be straight imprison at Damascus in a strong tower when Bertran see he can not find he he take a solemn oath that nothing but the extreme darkness of the night shall drive he from the field and with that he begin a new conflict propose his body against a world of sword but how many soever he dismount never rise again to become arm among the rest he encounter croniquant unto who he give such a blow as he cleave he in two piece now begin the pagan to recoil and fly ^oward the town whereof when Bandus be advertise be use all his force and eloquence to return but it be in vain for they report how king esclamart Goham and diverse other be take prisoner an^ carry to the christian tent which so soon as he hear he betake himself to flight also wh^m Bertran guion Thyerry and Huon chase so fierce that they put many of they to the sword as they enter the gate of the city reignier in this chase who guion have new make knight behave himself so valiant that he be name the Pagan^ tormentor thus enter king Bandus into the town with ten thousand that survive of a hundred thousand and better thus the saracen be overthrow by the valour of our baron who as the story report be so noble in their conquest that nothing can resist they they in this battle lose but four thousand man and the wealth they gain be so innumerable that the base in the christian army be able to purchase a castle beside king they have a hundred of the great pagan prisoner yet for all this the general be not commit but sorrow for the loss of their brother Florion to who fortune they know not what have chance brief their woe be so great that no tongue be able to report it but leave they in their doubtfulness let we return unto king Bandus who be enter into the city and sad for his discomfiture command Florion to be bring before he say christian I charge thou without any dissemble tell i thy name pagan answer he in who it be impossible for fear to have any residence I hate the thing from which thou bind i know than I be call Florion and so they baptize i as those know that be acquaint with i I have three brother who thou ought exceed to hate for they have vow never to part or turn aside until they have take the city of Damascus and convert her people unto our religion but I wonder much I see not Baucamont all this day sure he either oversleepe his glory or want courage to sustain himself in combat Christian say Bandus he be at montment and from thence be come with a mighty host to chastise your folly among who be a pagan name mervin who very rumour of excellency will daunt you with amazement but let those thing pass tell i I pray thou from what line be thou descend my father name say he be Gaultier of Denmark that now rule Babylon who mighty prowess have convert million of your faith to a perfect and true religion duke Oger also be my uncle who convert king moysant and that worthy son of his call florion who as the fruit of baptism give i the name I now carry know then if by thou my death be procure not all the kingdom of the world can shelter thou from vengeance be therefore advise by i and let i return to my brother so shall thou please they and rescue thy fortune from a great mischief by Mahomet reply though thy youth and smile eloquence may in a mild regard than i pay thy ransom yet know I be so far at (@) with relent clemency that before the sun decline a hour low thy head shall be twenty score from thy body 3 but when gaifier hear he he say remember king Bandus the famous prisoner and our fellow king who bide within the christian jurisdiction in my conceit it be more wisdom to exchange he then by his death to hazard all their fortune and I beseech you if they will render my brother Goham for he that you will yield and be please I be most willing answer Bandus t^y your fortune in the affair then depart gaifier and come to the tent of the christian at such time as our baron be set down to supper who in this manner he salute the great god Mahomet preserve king Bandus and direct his counsel and that God which you adore soon dispatch you from the border of th^se country guion and you other commander of this Christian society Bandus by i demand if you well ransom your brother from imprisonment for one of those king you have take which I shall nominate with all my he be say guion who heart for joy will have leap from his bosom when he hear Florion be not dead name who thou will and he shall be give for his ransom then deliver say he Goham my brother immediate be Goham fetch and his forfeit arm deliver he and so conduct by guion Bertran Thierrie and Huon even unto the wall of the city and Florion arm stand in the port where the exchange be solemn finish gaifier and Goham enter in and Florion issue forth who vow by the glory of his saviour to pay his host a round payment for his short entertainment then come his brother who embrace he and pompouf bring he to their tent where still remain many pagan prisoner unto who Bertran say that if they (@) not remove then false idall Mahomet and be willin^^^ baptize they shall (@) but they like devil hardener (@) their m^schiefe refuse then say guion brother (...) these king safe in prison until the emperor Charles return from the holy sepulchre who (...) with our father so shall the emperor (@) with our gift and applaud the honour of our sword it plea^eth i excellent say Bertran so dispatch their prisoner into strong (@) they go to their ^est till early in the next morning at what time they valiant assault the town but with fruitless success for why the city be strong fortify and people with abundance of all nation who defend it (@) with loss to their high admiration and in that do^^^full manner we will leave they and speak of king Mermont and the ever to be fear mervin  chap. 22 1 how king Mermont Baveamont mervin and two hundred thousand pagan arrive before Damascus 2 the loss the christian receive by the valour of mervin this while be Mermont upon the sea accompany with Baucamont Antifer and the puissant mervin but not with the good knight sir drohe for when he know the expedition be make against the christian he refuse the king colour and stay with the angel of woman divine berea who be rich in nothing than in the riches of his company so prosperous be the wind to their sail that within a very sh^rt space they attain to the sight of Dam^scus where they land about two league from the city now the history report that there be a certain espial who behold their land run to the tent of the general and cry out my lord why have you neglect to defend yonder hate-nourishing haven where even now there be land so many pagan as it be impossible to number Bertran more angry to fear then hear his word say avaunt villain thunder thy threat in the ea^es of dead man we fear no pagan a pinn^ sir say the spy believe i for certain I have see a hundred thousand or more when the rest hear and see his constancy they say let we arm ourselves providence avoid had-i-wist when they be all arm guion call Bertran and Thierry and say I pray you stay behind with five thousand soldier to this end that if they of the city issue upon we you may prevent they from enclose we behind to this they be agree so guion and the rest go against the pagan who begin to approach a little before the evening the rig^t renown mervin march before the rest and with he only crescent and jacob who conference be the praise of drohe in that he have refuse to bear arm against his own religion to which praise mervin lend double commendation affirm he as well worthy the title of a king as the honour of knighthood all the while that they be in praise drohe Mermont be encourage his soldier say now be the time for they or never to raise on high their god Mahomet in these discourse they do march along a river which lead they to a broad and spacious field where the christian be ready to charge they 2 amongst who Huon with his lance in his rest dis^anged himself against mervin upon who he break his staff with such fury that the more mervin be astonish the more he high esteem he tha^ lend he the cause of amazement yet not accustom or willing to die in any debt to so good a creditor he assail Huon so valiant that he bear he from the crupper of his horse back the shame of which fall lend sorrow to the soul of Huon because till that hour not any how puissant soever have power to make he lose his stirrup when as mervin have thus dismount he he turn to Huon and deliver he his horse say noble Christian mount thyself again for so excellent have I taste of thy virtue that I will not wrong thou to purchase a kingdom then vat Huon up into his saddle ease with this hope that a world of pagan that same day shall pay for the shame which mervin have do unto he now by this time be mervin like unto lightning fly into the midst of the army and Mermont like he be among the strong battalion who the gentle florion at the first encounter overthrow even unto the very ground and have in the same moment cut off his head if he have not be relieve by a strong band of saracen who mount their lord again fly all upon the infant but so gallant do he defend himself that they all start back and the bold dare not give another onset then cry he aloft Denmark and victory which as soon as Huon hea^d like a mad man he run into the battle and the first he encounter be marquant who he so salute that his head fly in two piece and after he a second a three and a four fall dead to the ground before he so mighty he seek to revenge the shame mervin have give he and in brief such be his prowess that he soon deliver florion from the throng of his enemy not far from they be guion who have make a great slaughter of the pagan for from one at a blow he strike his ear from his head and his head from his shoulder then old Baucamont advance himself who have but one arm in which he hold a strong lance wherewithal he be inflame to assail guion but he ^ailed of his intent though guion fail not at all of his purpose for with his sword as he pass by he strike that arm also from his shoulder to the terror of the beholder and torment of Baucamont who have never a arm leave cry o^t now be I the most miserable (@) reign under the sun who be as hateful to myself as fortune and with that pass through his army who sorrow in behold his misfortune when they of the city hear the rumour of this battle they issue out of the town but be immediate intercept by Bertran thyerie and five thousand christian who brave set upon they Bertran who be most hardy be the first that charge and meeting with a noble Sarazin name moysant stroke he dead from his horse after he four more in the same rank he after the same sort serve and then cry this day traitor shall be doom day to your generation at which word his brother thyerie and all the army give a most courag^us charge and overthrow a thousand pagan that never rise again to draw sword in anger what shall I write more Bertran his brother and their soldier though not without great peril so behave themselves against the citizen that if they have be any more than five thousand the pagan have never pass to join with the great new land army but now the day fail and the night begin to shut in the sun window which be propitious for our christian because if the day have endure the valour of mervin have overthrow their reputation but now by reason of the darkness a retreat be sound for which mervin be grieve and say they have conjure up cloud to shadow their fly but notwithstanding all part be content to use the present benefit now guion and Bertran be return unto their tent huge enrage and Bertran say brother ^nd lord this might have the pagan worst we but if I live till the morrow God be my aider I will achieve such wonder that the bloody livery my sword shall put on shall last long than their religion now the table be cover the noble company sit down to supper where they be honourable serve after supper as soon as the table be take away and the watch set the general go to their rest till the morning star awaken the sun from slumber then rise and arm themselves they marshal their army into a warlike proportion intend to assault the pagan who on the other side be every deal so watchful and stand ready to behold the signal guion the virtuous Dane behold both party equal preparation fall down upon his knee and thus pray thou true God of we and our forefather I beseech thou in this battle be our guide and our defender lift high the glory of thy own name and bruise the arm of thy profess enemy increase in we everlasting spirit of courage that no scandalous report of our misfortune bring our age father hair to the grave with disquiet if otherwise it be thy will that our death shall this day give a end to our aspire yet thou lamb of redemption and thou God of Israel vouchsafe that our soul may be place with thy saint in paradise as soon as he have thus say bow his head he kiss the earth 3 time for remembrance of the holy Trinity chap. 23 1 how the christian be vanquish by mervin 2 how guion Bertran Thyerrie Florion and huou of Buraeaux be take prisoner and carry to Damascus after guion have end his prayer and ceremony he come to his brother and say prince I beseech you in the honour of the holy passion of our great god blot from your thought the remembrance of all worldly action out (@) all your understand he apply to the axaltation of our true religion and the destruction of these faithless miscreant this say they march towards their enemy and the pagan range on the other side come proud against they but now by this time be spring up in Mermont and the other pagan prince a mighty envy against mervin as if his glory darken their praise and it seem to they that without his assistance they be able to vanquish the christian wherefore Mermont come unto he and say mervin thou be too valiant and over dare to march thus before continual in the hazard of all chance I pray thou stay behind with two and twenty thou^and and approach not until the extremity of our last fortune call thou because in thou consist our hope and thy loss will give a assurance to their conquest I will say mervin do what your majesty command i but of my lif^ there be no wisdom in this policy for I know by proof that all your mightiness be not able to resist their prowess yet notwithstanding approve your imagination and if fortune prove contrary my aid shall not be far distant though what you do in my conceit be but to gain that which I regard not I mean this day glory and not as you pretend my safety and it be true he prophesy for they envy he shall bear away the prize in each battle and he but the son of Barbin the merchant now begin the alarm to lighten in the ear of each army and a resolve pagan name turquant be the first that charge who Bertran separate himself encounter with such violence that his lance make way through both his side carry he to the ground his first and last mother at this the battle join like the outrageous meeting of many confuse water where the christian bear themselves most valiant and in the first shock overthrow a thousand pagan dead to the ground Bertran who as yet have not break his lance meeting with M^rbrom (@) he to the heart and break his lance with the encounter then draw he his sword with which he excellent know wh^n to aid when to def^nd and when to assail and with it do wonder guion his brother strike acquilant but not he of Lucerne but a other who at the first blow he divide to the girdle and then cry forward in the name of ^od you christi^n nation the day be o^^s thus say guion while thyerie who hold his sword in both his han^s be with his brother Florion in the midst of the army make a admirable slaughter now begin the ^^ttell to be strong and fearful in which the pagan die innumerable and the christian increase so high in their resolution that the sarazen begin from a little recoil to betake themselves to a main flight in which baucamont^as ^as slay by Bertran and Mermont take prisoner and with he diverse o^hers of the great estimation who be carry to the tent to accompany esclamart that have run the way of dishonour before they ^ut now behold the exchange of immortal fortune our thrice renown christian in who conquest seem to be proud because she live and who return victor from every battle shall unlucky be vanquish and overthrow by the hand of their neear cohsine most absolute mervin you have hear before how mervin stay behind with twenty thousand according to the commandment of Mermont to who as soon as a pagan have declare the mighty o^erthrowe that be befall they with a smile anger he say ^he king and his prince imagine to subdue the christian without Mernine in despite of mervin but it be happen otherwise and themselves be forsake for forsake mervin well now shall they know my power and the worth o^ my service for before the evening shall call forth the moo^e to appear in the great star-chamber I will revenge they on their enemy and restore their liberty this say he broach his renown beast and with his army give a hot charge on the christian who when they behold mervin though not discourage yet be they wondrous amaze and not without good cause for his man be fresh and mervin the best knight that in the world then live and they both overto^de and weary which when Bertran see he say courage immortal spirit and be not dismay to behold these pagan as I bear faith to my saviour they be no more to be esteem then the wither grass in a medo^ or the stalk of corn in the hand of a shearer by my life say Huon I think those we have slay have purchase a new resurrection not so say guion behold how they lie in heepes one upon a other after this talk they prepare themselves and encounter their enemy who they assail with unspeakable resolution but to too little profit for their weariness have so much weaken they that the pagan slay they most piteous and mervin so victorious triumph where he go that not any escape with life on wh^me the weight of his arm descend he slay Reignier guyons young knight and after he another and another and all whosoever be within the reach of his ^urie our baron be astonish to behold his resolution and yet more great encumbrance immediate fall upon they for why the citizen issue again and the rather at the ^^reaty of Guyda who beseech they to aid she to tak^ he alive who have slay her father to who Pimon declare that Bertran be he that slay he in the great battle who Guyda mighty desire and inward love imagine herself happy if she may but behold he the pagan assure she her wish and so sally out upon the christian on who mervin have reign lamentable misfortune ^ now be the gallant of Christendom enclose on every side they of the city behind they and mervin before they who alone be the planet of their destruction for why no force be proof against his magnanimity when Florion see that he alone hold in his hand their destiny he press unto he and give he such a blow thwart the helm that he close his eye from the day light but mervin recover himself pay he back so heavy a requital that he strike the infant from his horse to the ground backward who be no soon down but saracen eager leap upon he to who mervin say kill he not soldier on your life for he that wound he wound my soul also thus be one of the four brother take for who be make piteous lamentation there be at this instant leave of the christian but ten thousand who with one voice cry on God to be their aider and Bertran say follow i my heart one God one honour and one grave and then like a tempest of thunder he cast himself into the bosom of his enemy confound and kill all between he and the goal of honour mervin this while chase the christian to the gate of desolation at the which guion grow mad through anger and set himself against mervin give he such a blow that he make he bow his head to the crest of the great mare Mordant but mervin unaccustomed to have any such manner of regreeting stroke Thyerrie who then have thrust himself between they so mighty a blow that he ^ell to the earth and be instant take prisoner by the common soldier after that mervin have thus overthrow thyerrie there come a pagan unto he and tell he there wer^ two christian yet survive who it be impossible to take without great effusion for on whosoever their hand fall death follow and then he bring mervin where he find Bertran and Huon of Bordeaux who have join back to back show such discipline in arm as may well have remain a miracle to all age when mervin view their courageous resolution he grow enamour with their virtue yet for all that with his good sword he strike so manful at Bertran that albeit he never bend but to heaven yet now he be force to bow one of his knee to the earth then leave he he charge Huon who see the blow by recoil backward escape the violence but the pagan come swarm so fast behind he that he be able no long to defend himself against mervin now be all the noble christian take except guion who alone with five hundred do defend himself and they be all that sur^ued like a wild boar against a tree environ with a kennel of hungry dag so stand guion defend his life and teach his follower how to die brave but in a trice mervin put those fifty to the sword and take guion prisoner who he deliver to the pagan who he charge upon their allegiance and his displeasure to use those virtuous prisoner honourable when this be do he go unto their ^ents where he find king Mermont and four of his consort also king esclamart and sundry other pagan when mervin behold they he say king and prince what make you here I imagine you have overthrow the christian army but I see it be otherwise ah mervin say Mermont even for thy country sake and the honour of Mahomet deliver we from this thraldom thou be only wise only valiant and only most fortunate Mermont say meraine thy freedom be already pay for and then cut their band in sunder make they free from their affliction this do M^ruine command the tent t^ be ransack and all the wealth there of which be exceed much to be bring into the city then when all be perform and they return into the palace in Damascus mervin command all the prisoner who he have take to be bring before he and the other pagan prince which be according effect guyda look upon Bertran with a burn eye of desire and a amorous amazement say to Mermont can your majesty possible behold a semblance that more exquisite resemble the gallant feature of our most famous mervin than this Christian if his lineament be as big and as large shape it be most true madam say Bandus and the more I behold he the more I behold he in he how princess reply mervin be there in every place one like i heretofore you say I do resemble duke Oger and be I now become like this Christian what be he also of ogers li^e then turn to Bertran he say christian I beseech thou without dissemble tell i the name of thy father and the descent of thy predigree pagan say Bertran we who you behold be the four brother that have torment paganism and yet hope to be the last end of their destruction gautier of Denmark be our father who win his crown with his sword and Oger who you so renown and who envy herself dare not but extol be brother to guion our grandfather who now rule jerusalem it be m^st true say a pagan stand by guion king of jerusalem be brother to Oger who I behold in excellent combat to kill bruhy before the wall of laon and his brother justament before accre so fierce and valiant be the descent of their pedigree by Mahomet say mervin sith I resemble Oger I will I be also of his issue and so he be though mischief and evil (...) it from his knowledge but the time come in which he shall know himself and his offspring thus as you have hear question the pagan with Bertran who most stout make reply then Mermont rise up say to Bertran all thy lineage have be the scourge and ruin of our religion and I be too well assure that nothing but your death can give peace to our quiet wherefore mervin it be most necessary they die to excuse our further trouble not so my lord answer mervin again we will not wed tyranny and conquest together beside I vow in myself not to do they indignity till I have take as they their father gautier prisoner which do I will in a royal navy across the ^eas and lay siege to the flourish city of Paris and give battle to the emperor Charles that be surname great and by the aid of Mahomet I doubt not to bring all France to my subjection when mervin have thus say he command the four brother and all other Christian prisoner to be strong imprison in a impregnable tower where Bertran consume his time in lamentation for his royal father and mother it happen that guyda and Goham the brother of gaifier be one day under the turret they hear the complaint of the hapless christian sir say Guyda what be he that now speak know you his voice madam say Goham it be the mighty of the 4 brother and the most absolute knight in the world next mervin and his name as I take it be Bertran who lineage be as great as his mind both incomprehensible after these speech they depart but from Guyda never depart the remembrance of those speech wherefore as she go she say to herself that Bertran from her love shall find a invincible army to release he and that her desire shall attend on he while her heart entertain a sympathy of his affliction now be they return to the palace where all the pagan prince be set who both honour and scare mervin great because when he be angry he spa^ed no creature of what estate soever but deal his alm alike to all that malign he when supper be end mervin command that all the slay pagan shall have soldierlike burial which be do amongst the dead be find king Baucamont who mervin inter^d royal offer in his obsequy honourable lamentation as soon as the next day appear above the mountain mervin command all his army to be muster for he will instant march towards Babylon wherefore call king Bandus unto he he give he the charge and government of that city of Damascus swear he to his allegiance and with careful respect to nourish and guard the honourable Christian prisoner and also with all the reverend observance appertain to so great a majesty to adore and renown the excellent princess Guida when every ceremony of his charge be end he king Mermont and a thousand pagan take ship for Babylon where we will leave they and a while discourse of other matter  chap. 24 how Charlemagne depart from France to see the holy sepulchre arrive at Babylon and be royal receive of king Gaultier 2 of the embassage two pagan bring from mervin and 3 a council hold by the christian who demand day of king Karaheu of Florion of and of his father Maysan^ at their come to Babylon the history report that in this time the most famous emperor Charlemagne will needs go to jerusalem to adore the holy sepulchre and to that end demand of duke name if he will accompany he in the voyage who most willing agree advise his majesty withal that it be good to take with he also the reverend archbishop Turpin who have a long desire to the journey the twelve peer and five thousand resolve soldier to the end that if in that expedition they be encounter with any pagan prince they may yet be able to defend themselves from mischief thy counsel please i say Charles yet I can assure thou we may unresisted pass even unto Samaria and Damascus for that the rule of the christian run even unto their city wall to be brief in my discourse after Charlemagne have gather his train together he betake he to the sea where the gentle wind lend he so prosperous breath that in few day he arrive at a cape call the arm of saint George where they land and thence march to Babylon whither they run a little before dinner where they find gautier the nephew of Oger and with he Claretta his queen who have no understanding of Charlemaine approach till they behold he in their palace the joy at their first meeting be unspeakable and their entertainment so royal as make all (@) wonder after many ceremonial observance and some repo^e take Charlemagne ask gautier for his four w^rr^ly son who all the world make so famous for their (@) he reply that they be even then before the w^lls of Damascus with a puissant host where they have take Goham and diverse other king and prisoner and give the pagan a mighty overthrow as he be certify by letter not long since receive from their ^ents and many other discourse they have which I omit 2 anon as the two king duke name and the twelve peer be devise of sundry recreation there enter into the hall in proud and majestical manner tow pagan the one have to name juorin Montbrant the other Malegrap a^d when they come just before gautier without reverence the first thus speak gautier of Denmark first understand that we be send to thou from the puissant king Mermont from his royal admiral from king Manuel from Goham king of Egypt and from five other mighty king last though deserve a title before all other for the unvanquishable wonder of knighthood from a vassal of king mermonts name mervin who have vow to make all Christendom acknowledge no god but Mahomet and to that end by the exquisite perfection of his magnanimity he have take thy four son prisoner and slay all their host except themselves and thirty other who with they be detain at Damas who again thou shall never behold but with sorrow now these royal pagan king and thief Mermont by we command that pilgrim-like thou appear before they at Montbrant where they be land and on thy knee hum^ly implore their favour so shall thou purchase thyself grace and know their pleasure if otherwise thou resist with sword and fire they will instant besiege thy city when Gaultier have hear this thunder of a dismal oracle his heart tremble in the arm of grief and displeasure at last though it be long ere word can find way from amazement he say how can this be true which thou report when thou say my son be detain prisoner Gaultier reply the pagan it be most true then leave to wonder and give answer to my embassage 3 at this for a space they dismiss the pagan while the christian betake themselves to counsel where Gaultier demand what course be to be take in these time of extremity great prince say duke name this be my opinion to the ambassador shall no indignity be offer both because they be but the tongue of other heart and also because our baron who they detain be subject to the like vengeance wherefore let we demand aid of the christian king of juda and of the king and his son Florion entreat they to who religion and land it as near concern speedy to repair with their force and maintain the temple of our god and our own liberty to this counsel every one conclude then send for the pagan again thus Gaultier make they answer pagan return to your lord at your pleasure and say to Mermont and the other that I be hearty sorry for the

be subject to fortune they be every one take prisoner so as of the Christian host remain no more commander but the emperor Charles and duke naime who defend themselves gallant against their enemy mervin see Charlemagne he fall in love with his virtue say o Mahomet bow down thy eye and behold (@) invincible christian and then move with one envious love and alone le^t envy shall wrong so excellent perfection cry to the common soldier upon pain of death not to touch they which commandment they obey for they dare not gainstand then mervin oppose himself against they with honourable speech the true badge o^perfect magnanimity he say prince yield yourselves when fortune can avail to no more conquest and enrich i with your name because many pagan have tell i the arm you bear do belong to France and that one of you also be the emperor thou say true say Charles and know my name for dread of any sarazen be never change Charles be my name charles that rule Rome France and all Christendom and be duke name the near to i in counsel and affection therefore stand upon thy guard and approach we not for here will we live and here will we lear^ to die who first present himself to be our tutor shall never have other priest surgeon or sepulchre at this speech a pagan king rush to duke naime give he such a blow as he strike he to the ground but the duke quick recover his foot again and mad with that amazement send he back such a requital that the pagan thereof die and then be the emperor and the duke assail on every side fresh who notwithstanding defend themselves valiant insomuch that mervin pity they and stand in doubt whether it be better he shall prevail or they perish at this he descend from his mare and embrace king Charles to who he say thou excellent wonder of knighthood alas thy defence be bootless and I die to think thy fortune shall perish yield to he who pity thou ha^^ take prisoner in behold thy virtue Charles hear this and such honour in his enemy say thou glorious almighty that for their sin exile Adam and Eve from paradise comfort and coun^ell i and with that he yield himself to mervin only desire he to balance his honour not by the foil of his

so special charge of adoration and reverence that like a demie-god he be deify duke name see Charlemagne take deliver his sword to mervin thus be the emperor Charles duke naime the 12 peer and 34 noble christian take prisoner and all bind one to another except the emperor who have engage his royal word t^ mervin not to depart without his licence this be do and that there be not leave a Christian which be not slay or take mervin go instant and give a assault to Babylon but the citizen know it folly to withstand when their chief commander be imprison come forth and deliver the town to their mercy bow their neeke to the yoke of slavery renounce the only true God become misbelieve miscreant as soon as Mermont be enter into the town he imprison Charlemagne and the other christians in a tower where they be safe guard as prize of inestimable^ value but king Charles spend all his time in tear and such like lamentation alas thou maiden mother of the world salvation ought I alone to be the subject of all misfortune must my long admire honour die in so shameful a grave of disparagement and must my rule that stretch beyond Europe and Asia be herself contain in a square of this little compass if so it must be it be my sin and happy I if it alone be chastise for my transgression thus speak king Charles who bird flourish like a white palm tree mervin have now little repast himself call together the pagan king and prince say my lord this place we must make no place of repast or banquet because sluggardise be hateful to the honour whereto we covet to aspire wherefore prepare yourselves present to depart for I will not rest till I have take mesques and jerusalem and bring the whole country thereabouts to our subjection and teach the people to adore no god but Mahomet lord mervin say Mermont thy will shall be our guide and thy course shall direct we then send their drum and trumpet about and summon their band together triumphant they depart from Babylon and so restless continue in their march that they short appear before the wall of Me^ques to which they lay so fearful a siege and give such marvelous assault as in few day they take the town put man woman and child to the sword except those that willing fall down and adore Mahomet thus mervin make himself lord and master of mesques dor he have a desire to rule in that city yet he will needs forward to jerusalem so he make a pagan his lieutenant to rule only in his name and with the great pomp that may be before his departure crown himself king of mesques chap. 26 1 how mervin and the pagan host come before jerusalem 2 how the citizen render up the town 3 how mervin refuse to enter into the city but return to Babylon at which many of the pagan murmur after mesques be convert to the damnable belief of Mahomet and mervin have establish it for his own government he will not sleep any occasion but charge all his army to be in readiness for that forthwith he will march to jerusalem to make himself lord of that mighty town and the country thereto adjoin when Mermont hear he and see the desire he have to spread their law through all nation he say o Mahomet how great be thy work that from the loin of the poor merchant Barbin have ^aised a glorious branth to exalt thy honour and to bring all Christendom to subversion this speak Mermont in the hear of mervin to who he do all the reverend honour may be devise but in soul both he and all the pagan prince extreme hate he because the honour wherewith they shine be but borrow from his splendour and for that their labour can never attain to a perfect end yet they dare not but obey he fear not love be their ruler all thing be now prepare they depart from mesques and march with such prosperous expedition that they come before the noble and sacred town where the lam^e of (@) all glory suffer his death and passion for the world redemption 2 as soon as mervin behold it he practise it and immediate prepare for so strong and dreadful assault so that the poor christian behold their imminent danger hold a counsel and conclude to deliver up the key of the city wherefore come forth and cast themselves prostrate before mervin they say dread lord of our life and being behold we the chief ruler of this hapless town render ourselves to thy gracious mercy deliver to thou as to our liege lord all our possession promise to serve thou loyal and to hold thy faith law and religion mervin hear they reply citizen stand up and be courageous for your peace be conclude in a happy hour assure yourselves from the honour of my reputation neither man woman nor child of this town shall be damnify so return in all peace and be loyal for not a soldier shall come within your gate but we will all return unto Babylon then turn to the host he command they to take up their pavilion and march towards Babil^n 3 at this all the saracen be mischievous agr^eved and with private murmur rail upon mervin who to their trouble will allot no end but notwithstanding all they set forward and by the restless labour of many day and night at last they arrive at Babylon where they banquet and repose themselves the space of (@) day after it happen upon a day that jacob the merchant come to mervin and say how now my lord how walk love in your thought what be he utter exile be there n^ remnant of memory leave to preserve the perfection of beautiful berea ha jacob say he more than thy blunt sense be able to measure but why do thou now examine i upon this holy article for this say jacob that if absent time have not shut excellency in doubtfulness then will I have you that you may by it bind her love in a more eternal band of affection take Charles his twelve peer and the rest of thy prisoner and as the conquest of thy sword and her beauty deliver they to her sacred majesty that she may dispose they until they return from France and those other country which already thou have subdue and of which in ensue time thou shall be king and ruler jacob qd mervin thou have tutor i to my contentment and thy as a oracle for to she and no other myself and my sword be devote as they be thus confer Mermont enter in who with a lowly yet kingly adoration salute mervin and more will have do if he know to have do more for fear he stand in towards he than for any religious affection he bear he and then say my lord qd mervin it behoove you now to think of your expedition into France and to dispose of these christian you have already take say mervin if your majesty will walk into the great hall where the rest of the pagan prince be set in counsel we will discuss of this affair mervin call the gaoler command he to fetch the prisoner he have in charge instant the Turk perform his will and bring forth Charles the twelve peer and all the rest of the Christian prisoner as soon as mervin see they he stand up and say king prince and baron my will be that these christian prisoner be convey to the castle of Turgon until by my prowess I have conquer France and all the famous country border her territory how say or wherefore shall they be thither hale o what reason be in so do I tell you their life be dangerous death they have deserve and death by my will shall they have scarce be his word end but another pagan rose up say mervin attend my word this many year have I travel my body and waste my revenue to effect these conquest and shall I now lose my guerdon part have I win of these prisoner my part will I have and that part shall part with their life at this present and I also say another pagan who be both rich in wealth and strong in friend and his name be gratian it be reason I have my part and profit of these prisoner otherwise prince let we join together and with our sword divide they chap. 27 1 how merui^e will not consent to the death of the christian 2 the great battle which fall out in the palace 3 how the christian aid mervin and how the pagan come and cry he mercy when mervin and not without (@) see the arrogancy of the pagan and that (@) force they will divide those spoil (@) they which his sword only have obtain he be almighty displease and with a fiery countenance of anger tell they it shall not be as they have deem but that in despite of the proud in that assembly he will bear the christian to montment and as divine trophy of his affection he will present they to his celestial lady and mistr^sse as jacob before have give he counsel wherefore say he if there be any pagan of what estate soever that speak another word of resistanc^ my sword shall be so equal a judge betwixt he and i of my vengeance that the rest shall be warn by his misforture and then raise his voice more high what say he will you divide the thing belong to i at your pleasure I swear by my homage to Mahomet the proudst pa^an that dare to contradict my will or mislike the intent of my action shall forfeit his head to my sword present as he thus speak k gratian rise up who have about he a mighty band of sarazen and swear by Mahomet he will kill Charlemagne for he have be the scourger and tormenter of our religion therefore say he this day will I take vengeance on his head and not be withstand by threat or deny my pleasure by a boy the base son of a silly merchant at this word he go to king Charles and take he by the beard which be white than snow say false traitorous king this day will I hang thou like a thief and withal strike he with a cudgel 2 which be so unpleasant to the eye of mer^ine that draw his sword he strike king gratian betwixt the neck and the ear with s^ch violence that he chine he even to the girdle but no soon be that fatal blow deliver but the whole army assail mervin with infinite violence yet miraculous defend himself never strike in vain so that from every blow death ensue there be among they another king and cousin to gratian who be the great setter forward of the sedition he mervin overthrow dead to the ground and then begin the battle to increase with huge horror against mervin who like a madman lay about he here and there not spare any 3 when our Christian prince perceive that for their safety mervin have thrust himself into this dangerous adventu^^^ they conclude among themselves either to aid he or p^^rish in attempt and then thrust themselves before he they say courage prince mervin this day we will die for thou for thou have be gracious to our misfortune and we will partake thy extremity with that they thrust themselves against the pagan with every one a sword in his fist make a fearful and bloody skirmish from one they cut his head from another his arm leg from the three and general life from the most they encounter Charles in this battle behave himself most courageous but mervin more enrage than a long hunt boar without regard make slaughter of all before he and by the aid of the christian quick winnow the hall of live creature mervin see this say to the christian lard beware that by you no treason be^ide my fortune for than shall your uniustnes give shame to your valu^es prince mervin qd Charles doubt not our trustiness who whilst we breathe will not fail thy fortune and when thou be conqueror be judge of our life and death as please thou after these speech they all issue out of the hall and assail the pagan on every side who with fear be so surprise that they (@) not to what fortune to betake they but cry out woe alas mervin be enrage he have forget Mahomet and be become a Christian notwithstanding this mervin and the christian pursue they and as the history say slay 64. in a moment which not a little grieve Mermont who now can not record any mean how to appease mervin at last he call Barbin and with tear beseech he to cool the fi^e of his sonn^s wrath and then they two join together go and on their knee cast themselves before he while Mermont say ^rince mervin for the love of Mahomet and Barbin thy father and in ruth of my tear who sometime thou have call thy soveragine appease thy just indignation and i will swear unto thou by the host of Mahomet to perform thy will in all thing and if it be please in thy sight henceforth become thy subject by jupiter say mervin thou have speak in a happy hour rise father and rise king of montment my anger shall break if my wrong be amend then turn to the christian he say prince return into the hall for a truce shall be conclude and my will no more neglect no soon have he speak but Charles and his peer return into the palace and mervin with a angry look say to the pagan prince imagine i not satisfy though I show a relent for by my right hand my servant death shall not be dismiss till the proud of you all upon your knee come and cry i mercy at this all the pagan cast themselves on their face before he and with one voy^e cry have mercy

christianity and that he may the less mistrust we shall be proclaim through the city our conversion what will of this ensue shall be his ruin the pagan applaud this resolution so they arise and have effect what they will take the key of the city and march forth with great joy towards mervin who so soon as he see Mermont and other he turn to ga^tier and say behold with what joy the pagan approach we bear in their hand witness of peace how bless be this conquest that be without effusion and how glad be I they be so easy convert alas his innocency think not of the treason they have invent by this they be come either to other while the pagan fall upon their knee before mervin cry welcome o ten time happy welcome be mervin the son of invincible Oger into this country then bespeak Mermont thou most wise most strong and valiant prince live in this or the immortal world behold we fall down before thou ready to receive and acknowledge thy law and religion every one most desirous of that

subject many other ceremony be between they and then they march on to Babylon who wall be replete with joy triumph and banquet then be a solemn festival hold and the temple most sumptuous adorn then be Mermont and all the other pagan king baptize who unwilling go willing to the sacrament comfort only with treason and false infidelity 3 when all the king and citizen in Babil^n be baptize mervin go thence to M^qua where in a hour space he cause all the country to be baptize which do he go to jerusalem where easy he accord all the citizen for albeit they be conquer yet they have not forsake chr^stian religion only doubtful at the first not know Meruins conversion they feign to adore Mahomet but know his will they soon cast away that base believe these thing thus effect the gentle mervin return to Babylon and make all the country border there about become christian and whatsoever before time he have graft in hell seek paganism for joy whereof the christian make many holy day sing hymn in his honour protest he to be the renowm that ere be bear of a mother but on the contrary part Mermont lie work his imagination how to work vengeance on he who the heaven so exceed love chap. 33 how by treason Mermont bring mervin to Minor 2 how gautier after the departure of mervin go with all his army to montment where he find to who he tell how her father be become a Christian 3 how Mermont speak to Butor to imprison mervin it happen after easter that on a certain day king Mermont resolve to work mischief on mervin and call he to he to blindfold his eye he say son it be not unknown to i the affection betwixt thou and my daughter the which be a usual joy to my imagination wherefore sith no better good can make better my happiness I beseech thou let i know the day of thy espousal a day than which nothing be more desire my sovereign king say mervin let the day be at your highness dispose and if it so seem please let we to morrow rather than to day pass to that desired conjunction willing qd mervin yet before of necessity we must go to minor unto the queen my sister who by a solemn oath I have give assurance that I will myself in person come to invite she to those gorgeous nuptial because my daughter have ever be most dear in her regard and estimation as for your army that may k. gautier conduct before to montment and take order for all preparation worthy in so great a solemnity well have your majesty say quoth mervin let every thing be so dispose and in the morning they and we will take our several journey willing qd Mermont imagine with himself to bring mervin to a place whence he shall never be restore after this mervin call gautier to who he tell his resolution entreat he to convey his army to montment his soul to his lady and mistress and his happiness into her bosom gautier at the first stand amaze and beseech he not to be too much too trusty and drohe tell he he be suspicious of some evil under this extreme familiarity but mervin who adjudge every thought by his own think persuade they otherwise insomuch that gautier his wife his son Huon and Drohes together with the army embark themselves for montment and Mermont mervin and a troop of traitorous confederate likewise take ship for Minor fortune be so favourable to mischance that in short time they come to their wish land 2 then mount upon their horse they take the way that lead to the city in which we will leave they and return to gautier and the other christian who doubtful of the mischief that follow make such haste both by land and sea in their journey that in short time they come to montment where they find the miracle of nature who rejoice at their come but when her eye be not hallow with the sight of mervin her joy convert to tear and she demand of gautier where her love her life and substance remain forth with gautier report how her royal father be baptize and consent to her espousal to which end he and mervin be go to Minor to fetch her aunt to be a glory to the festival when hear this that her father be baptize she praise God but in that he have carry her love to Minor ^hence issue doubt fear and suspicion and woe be i it be not without strong reason for the place be dreadful and impregnable the description whereof follow as be set down in story minor as ancient chronicle do testi^^e from whence this history be derive be very strong situate it have at the four corner four most high rock or promontory of which one exceed all the other in height and hugeness from whence descend a mighty river name orb most wonderful deep rough and contageon it be guard upon each side with a couple of rock between which every one must pass to the city by a narrow way but five foot in breadth at the extreme neither be there any way save that only the history say that in the time of king Pharaoh these rock and this river be make by magic art and this city name Minor found as a thing impregnable for it have before the entrance four port or passage strong guard the first be Auster and it have a pagan name auroufe fell and powerful continual to defend and keep it oueragainst it be a other of the same strength defend by one even as strong and sufficient the three be of a more terrible fashion than these for the gate be of iron and next it a tower who height seem to touch the heaven after one have pass that gate who name be tombare they enter into Minor a beautiful city wash upon every side with the river orb Mermont and mervin by this time be pass through the first port who be much abash to behold so strange a passage and such work of wonderful resistance demand diverse question of their hugeness in the end they encounter with auroufe who know Mermont since the bring of his sister into those part let he pass in peace and mervin also thence they come to the second gate call baucair which when mervin see he demand what devil of devilish way that be and when they shall come to the city fair son qd Mermont you be abash at the^e entrance yet be content and we shall easy overpass they then they go till they come to t^mbar the last port who ghastly proportion make mervin wonder more than before and demand what fury of hell have exalt that tower to threaten heaven sure it must needs fall it can long ind^re yet say mervin for that the masonary be both strong and exquisite and the rock of each side as supporter do maintain it by my soul say mervin this be a villainous situation for I see not any way to issue or enter but this only true qd Mermont neither be there any creature whatsoever that enter within this portcullis that can repass without the leave of king Butor or gaiamy his sister this say they come to the iron gate through which they pass all the porter do they great reverence thus far have go^e they come into the fair and honourable city which to behold mervin mighty rejoice because till then he go in worse than starlight a certain pagan go before to king Butor tell he the approach of Mermont wherefore he arise t^ go meet he but his son marant will not but withdraw himself into a private chamber sit muse what occasion shall draw thither his uncle one while he think he be come to take vengeance upon he for the treason he have commit against mervin at montment for which drohe have slay Calix in combat as be before write otherwhiles he do imagine other but the traitor Mermont as false as himself be faulty have not one thought so near a kin to honesty for only his come w^s to do endamagement to mervin because he adore the true god and renounce their false prophet Mahomet 3 now be Mermont come into the court even to the king palace where he find Butor and diverse of his baron that be come forth to greet he kingly be their encounter on both side and much ceremonious the

full bowl and rich accate adorn entertainment when supper be end and music come in and the gallant of the court betake they to dance amongst they mervin take singlay dance with she a stately measure during which heavenly motion Mermont Butor and the queen ^el^ a solemn though damnable counsel about the ruin of the ever to be regard mervin Mermont avow the occasion of his come to be for nothing but to behold his utter destruction and thence he dilate his bring up and a duenture his conquest triumph and last his backsliding from Mahomet who before he have adore withal affirm his valiance so boundless and not to be resist that he will soon subvert the whole estate of their religion therefore good king a^d my brother say Mermont it not behove to who Mahomet have give power of controlment to imprison he and k^^pe he safe from further deface of his temple but if by any maane he will again be convert to our faction then assure thou so strange be his resolution that we shall be monarch both of France and all christian doom with most easy adventure all this while mervin be dance without thought of infidilit^e court most honourable the beautiful singlay who heart with his excellency

this if once the vassal come there be no redemption nor have any creature power of deliverance for so Merlin enchant it who bind the devilish Mutafier beyond the power of all other conjuration till such time that by bloody vow and execrable protestation he swear ever to beat his hest and commandment not dare to wrong body or soul without his authority and then be Mutafier enlarge and ever after make free from that dungeon into this place shall this mervin be convey neither will I rest till I see it full bring to pass and finish after all revel be end torch be bring to convey the prince to

messenger in guerdon of his pain a cup of gold desire he to recommend the perfection of his service to the most kind and love lady who he will honour and adore and after other compliment dispatch he and depart Butor and Mermont the wake dragon of impiety by this time be depart from Brandis and now by sea be come to the port of Luternia two league from montment the wh^^st the christian arm themselves to encounter they have intelligence by their espial that pass to and fro of their near arrival and Bertran come to his father beseech his majesty to deliver he a regiment of the old (@) who with himself he will lay in ambushment in the wood till the pagan be pass by and then at such time as the main a^my shall charge they in the face he behind will equal the encounter and not doubt but to put all to the sword in a moment his counsel be hold currant and consent unto now come the pagan march with silent carefulness think half in a ^l^mber to surprise the city but they be prevent for gautier meet they with a well order battle the proportion consist of three batallion the first conduct by guyon contain five thousand the second by Huon of Bordeaux be five thousand and the last by himself also five thousand so that the main be fifteen thousand beside ten thousand that lie obscure with Bertran as the pagan pass by the wood Bertran take a perfect view of they and smile he say unto drohe who be his companion in that stratagem behold with what have these pagan post to their misery see see drohe do thou s^e that gallant beast the foremost be mount on by he that give i life this day I will give he thou for a present a seat worthy of thy seat than a infidelious miscreant at these word drohe look careful see Butor mount on the brave mare Mordant sometime the delight of mervin which with grief make he stand as if he and be thunder-struck till rage appease sorrow he say to arm to arm prince Bertran let i die if I do stay any long and see a traitor in triumph ride on the gallant Mordant worthy none but her master invincible mervin this say they mount upon their horse and sound a cornet which be a signal to gautier of their come issue out of the wood and charge the rearward of the pagan thorough and thorough which Butor behold command a alarm and say courage gallant resolution and be not abash for this handful of christian who pride not prowess make they desperate and at this they turn upon their enemy where one may have see Bertran bear honour from every other creature and come to he that ride on the gallant horse he have promise drohe with the first blow be smite he dead from his saddle then take the steed deliver he to drohe say my promise this day be perform and my word justify at that drohe with humble thanks dismount and mount on his new gift than they two thrust themselves among the pagan death like a gentleman usher pass before they give to the battle a fearful and miserable beginning 2 gautier that on their face shall now on their back be enforce to charge they in which shock Huon show his prowess to be most invincible in that may it ^elfe want might to resist he he slay infinite and leave innumerable wound among the rest he slay the nephew to king gautier who death whilst his uncle pursue to revenge he make forfeit for his own life dreadful and somewhat doubtful be the battle a long time because the pagan be a hundred thousand and the christian but five and twenty thousand who notwithstanding by their wisdom the best weapon in warfare in the end become conqueror marvelous this day be the act of Bertran make conquest in love with herself because he love she guyon his brother be not short of infinite praise who in the heart of the battle show himself lord of al^ heart and encounter a kinsman of Butors he slay he at the fight whereof a whole band of saracen assail he cry thou die this day no valour shall release thou and then rush all with one fury they bear he from his horse and take he prisoner but as they be intend to present he to king Butor Bertran that then be come into the strength of the battle and by the tumult of the pagan suspect they have take some prisoner all enrage and grieve he turn to the press make every hinderer of his way a companion to his grave till he see they who lead his brother guyon bind in honour dishonourable fetter which when his eye affirm as true witness lead by a virtuous lunacy he ^lew in among they and strike he that hold his brother such a blow that he cleave he to the breast after he another and another till guyon be at liberty then give he a excellent sword the present of delight they two brother begin a strong battle against fifty pagan guyon in revenge of his wrong clothing his sword in the heart blood of the pagan by this time come post by they the seneschal of jabary who as Bertran be about to encounter he say to prevent he b^y de^ist and let i pass by thou for I will adjourn thy ill fortune till I have slay he who have kill my brother and then if thy life be weary I will end thy breathe pagan say Bertran thou and thy intent be so far asunder that I must needs talk with you before your pass so goodly a iourey and then turn aloft his sword he assail the seneschal with such delicate virtue that in a instant he send he to sleep with his great great great grandfather father then arrest his horse he give he to his brother guyon who mount thereon in the battle do most maruelious action cry honour for heaven and Denmark which word give life to their soldier and revive the half die wound so that he pagan unable to resist any long betake themselves to flight and be utter discomfit which when Butor behold and compare his huge host with their slender train he call Mermont and say my lord of montment I see it be impossible by fortitude to regain your city so high be the christian enrage and so miserable the chance of our evil fortune it be true it be very true answer Mermont the sunshine of our glory be wane therefore let we fli^ till time prefer better adventure this be speak they betake themselves to flight towards the sea coast which their army behold like distraught man fly here and there and every where to save their life while Bertran his brother gautier and Huon follow the chase put to the sword all that be overtake so that of a hundred thousand that be at the begin of the flight there escape but four hundred who with the king enter into their ship and betake themselves to the sea rail and curse the great courage of the christians who after the chase end return to the place of battle where it be admirable to behold the slay multitude who lie one upon another swim in their own blood who current be mighty like to a flow river amongst the pagan be find unspeakable riches which gather together the conqueror return victorious and triumphant into montment have lose of their own army but only ten thousand they be royal receive of who all that day have pray for the rare success of their good fortune because she fear it the pagan have prevail either her life or happy day shall undoubted have quail gautier by certain prisoner he have take understand all the manner of meruines imprisonment in Minor whither Butor and Mermont be flee wherefore he protest before God and his holy saint to follow they to which end he send proclamation round about the realm of montment to summon all the prince thereof in his aid and the rescue of the most worthy mervin who love be so infinite in those part that present there be number twenty thousand absolute approve knight know most valiant courageous which with exceed joy gautier with himself embark take also with he diverse pagan prisoner to conduct he the way to that receptacle of horror that academy of misfortune damnable Minor chap. 2 1 how gautier the Dane with twenty thousand follow Butor and Mermont to Minor 2 of the skirmish and take of Nubia and turquants death 3 bertrans policy for surprise of Minor GAut^er the Dane his four son Huon of Bordeaux Drohes and with they twenty thousand redoubt man at arm be aboard their ship hoist up sail and knit all their heart in one thought protest in the sight of God to pursue Butor so incessant that if he take but a breathe rest in any place they will overtake he and bid he new battle so on they sail till they come by a goodly city call Nubia who governor be king turquant who at that instant have leave the town to conduct and convey Butor on his way to who he be ally by a knot of affinity Mermont and the other pagan be pass by a week before 2 when gautier understand who town it be and unto who it appertain he immediate land his man and vow to assail it the which he do take it with small or no loss to himself but infinite to his enemy for he put man woman and child to the sword that refuse to be baptize which do he draw out of the new baptize a regiment of the best repute and leave behind a garrison of his own soldier to fortify and keep the city and then depart on his way towards Minor in which expedition he be so speedy that he attain a wood but six league from thence where as his army be repose they may behold the king of Nubia return from the conduct of Butor and with he five hundred soldier who when he see they swear unless they be christian they shall never escape they which a citizen of Nubia hear say my lord it be turquant our late king that even now be return homeward from Minor at thate word gautier set his man in order to charge he whilst turquant survey they fetch a drepe sigh and say prince this day I fear we shall espouse our evil fortune for I see man prepare to give we battle yet be their nation and colour unknown to we yet what or whosoever they be we must and will be our defender these word be speak so faint that his army like man half die cry for a tru^e say they be but reed and unable to endure the storm of so great a army but as they be in speak gautier set upon they and fly the most part the rest fly about the field here and there for succour which they find nowhere the sight whereof be so irksome to king turquant that in a mad rage he strike a christian even in the presence of Bertran such a mighty blow that he fall dead at his foot which when the virtuous prince behold he assail the pagan so courageous that with the first blow he divide the union betwixt his head and shoulder then forthwith be the poor remnant of the pagan take prisoner who for their life safety promise to receive their soul safety I mean baptism then demand gautier where they have leave king Butor and Mermont and they tell he in Minor prepare a invincible army to return withal to montment by the health of my soul say Bertran i will block up that way and if I live feast myself in his palace at Minor alas sweet son say gautier how shall we possible be so happy when the entrance of our passage be but five foot broad and that most dangerous dear father answer the prince esteem not fearful description for I have invent how and which way to make both ourselves commander of the town and prince of their destruction and thus it be 3 I will arm myself in the armour of this dead king and mount on his horse spread out his now infortunate colour and with such like company as he be attend with i will march towards the town into which I know I shall enter easy because they will imagine i to be the king of Nubia which I will no soon have effect but I will guard the gate with such careful resolution that famous so that in all the haste it be put in practice and five hundred christian of the best respect be arm both your highness and your army shall have easy passage this stratagem be much commend and his wisdom with the pagan armour among who be gautier Huon and drohe when they be come within three league of Minor gautier leave the gross sum of his army and with the five hundred march till they be pass through the first port of the city which be govern by aroufle who take Bertran that march on the head of the troop for the king of Nubia say my lord will your majesty return again and Bertran answer he will for he go but only to speak with the king Butor his kinsman promise he at his return a gift shall for ever make he rich the pagan give he humble thanks with doglike reverence and so let he pa^se and when his army be go by he turn to aroufle and draw his sword say traitor this be my treasury and here com^s the reward I promise and with that (@) strike he with such virtue that well may have cleave a rock of ma^ble but to the pagan it (@) no hurt at all because he be clothe in the hide of a serpent which sometime be the armour of invincible robaster who now live a hermit in the wood there adjoin where he continue ever since he forsake the fair guerin of montglai^e at such time as most famous Charlemagne come before Vienn^a which by fair guerin mean he conquer for hate whereof robaster will have slay he but that guerin guard he from mischief for grief whereof he be so enrage against she that he swear never hereafter to do her service and so lead by discontentment come into those wood and there build a hermitage live and be foster by his father Malabeon cast away his serpent skin ^s intend never more to be see in battle yet he misconceive for he must be the aider of prince mervin as you have hear before when shall be the will of the heaven but let these digression pass we will return to Bertran who after the first blow she pagan take a bar of iron and with it give he such a requital that he make he reel and almost fall from his he^se have not drohe uphold he to the no little stain of bertrans remembrance who call again his strength together give the Sarazin such a blow that he bow one of his knee to the ground in submission yet his body unwounded can no way be taint drohe behold this charge the pagan and break his lance but do not hurt he Huon do asmuch but as little prevail to their wonder and his great pride Bertran at this amaze dismount himself and close with the pagan who by clean strength he throw down to the ground backward then alight drohe and lift up the head of the serpent with his sword make a passage through his body by which his soul flee downward to eternal darkness chap. 3 how Bertran pass all the gate and drohe with he also 2 of the prowess they show against the pagan 3 how they be take prisoner and put to the keep of the fair singlay when the pagan aroufle be slay a charitable deed for Christendom Bertran throw he into the river orb and then march on the narrow way till he come to the second port which he likewise pass kill the guard thereof and throw they into the river but when gautier see with considerate eye the straightness and danger of those passage he persuade the prince to retire say honour lose his honour by dare beyond the conceit of power those way in which none hardly can go but endanger be tell tale of their destruction therefore whilst time be wish they to use the time of their deliverance my gracious father say Bertran I beseech you be not so suspitio^s for if myself alone and but ten with i pass of my life the town shall be surprise it be too great a mastery say the king therefore be counsel and return for shame my gracious father say he let we not have go thus far return scare with imagination the city will take i for the king of Nubia and that shadow will defend we at this both

when Butor have hear his word he command he to be strong imprison which be do then the king consult together Mermont say my lord of Minor now remain under your arrest prince Bertran so famous for his valour and renown for the descent of his royal pedigree it behoove your majesty to be most circumspect because at this instant you have in thrall the triumvirate of virtue the itj. famous flower of knighthood mean mervin Bertran and Drohes these word when the beautiful singlay hear she whisper unto she own and swear by Mohomet that if her power be powerful there shall no evil befall prince Bertran more than the burden of her best love because his valour be more than ever her eye have see before that instant time whilst thus she be talk to her thought all the prince and baron go out of the palace gather all the force that they can together to assail Bertran who have barricade and fortify the door of the chamber go with his sword to defend the window where the first that scale they be send with a blow dead to the earth which Butor behold and grieve to behold command to fetch faggot and to burn the house choose rather loss of wealth than will the which be perform in a instant the sight whereof bring the wit of Bertran to astonishment 3 but ere the fl^me take any effect singlay fall at her father fleet and beseech the obtain of a reasonable petition whereto the king consent she say then my lord spare this noble christian and it to i he will submit his person let i be his guardian and I doubt not but easy make he adore Mahomet daughter say the king thou be gracious in my sight and thy suit be grant and if it be possible bring he to honour the shrine of our prophet joy will not let the virgin stay to be ceremonious in thanks but she go to Betrran and persuade he to lay away his arm and yield to she who have undertake for his safety show the danger otherwise of his fortune and the pitiless regard of fire when it prevail add to her word private tear the witness of her secret good meaning when as Bertran have behold singlay and survey her beauty virtue and majestical carriage when he have note the gracious aspect of her eye and the love-inticing pity of her countenance immediate he be enamour with her perfection and wi^h honourable sweetness return she this answer so sacred be the beauty of thy heavenly eye that even i and my heart thou have take prisoner well may thou command i who thou have enthrall and will God be the time so gracious that not here but in France I may do you service but sacred madam though my case be desperate yet do i a favour for charity tell i whether my companion be dead or breathe with the live fair prince quoth she he live without hurt though without freedom and be in my prison where yourself in peace shall live if you submit to my mercy Bertran at this conquer with beauty oratory give up his sword into her silver hand protest that no fear of death make he yield but only the commandment of beauty to which beauty and her pity he surrender his life and fortune Bertran now unlace his helmet and put it off who former labour have raise so cheerful a blood in his face that singlay esteem he singular in every perfection and loud ready at her elbow double her wound and redouble her affection wherefore she say come young prince and follow i but I pray you speak to my father grave and humble so shall your thraldom be less straight and I more able to do you service he consent to do what ever she will command he and thus they come before Butor who first salutation be that immediate he shall lose his head if he fall not down and adore Mahomet and Bertran enrage give a reply contrary to his promise say the threat of the damn devilish pagan in the world shall not make he forsake his god nor think one reverend think o^ their false man-deceiving and devilish protector when singlay hear he speak with this spleen of malice she weep bitter fear lest her father who be subject to passion shall subscribe his will to her love funeral which to prevent she come and desire her father to leave argument and to refer he to she who she doubt not but quick to change from his purity and make he a religious sarazen daughter say the king I agree but be you watchful lest he escape for we have have toon extreme trial of his valour with virgin reverence she thank his majesty and forthwith carry Bertran unto her prison wh^re drohe be huge perplex with torment and bind hand and foot with fetter but toone she take they off and have they both in her custody like a bondslave to her thrall sweeten their servitude with her service but let they pass we will speak of gautier who all this while be before Minor continue a siege against it the space of itj. year but all be to bootless purpose for he lose many and gain nothing the city be so impregnable wherefore hold a council it be think expedient to raise their siege and return back unto montment which they do burn with fire before they go the four straight passage of Minor and that be all the revenge they have for itj. year trouble great be the haste gautier make to come to montment where he have leave his virtuous wife Claretta and but when he come he find all his hope overturn for in his absence the cruel king gorbant have be there take the town put Claretta to death and too have not faint womanish fear make she forsake her god and fall once again brfore Mahomet beside she do one other deed of great illness that after be a torment to she and that be by the mean of Mordant she tread upon the crucifire and the image of the virgin Mary for which with this curse she be punish that she will commit high treason against her son orient which she do for when his wife be deliver of seven son she make they away and persuade her son she have bring forth seven dog for which the lady life be hazard till God the revealer of truth make the truth know be burn deserve as you may read in the history of Godfrey of Bullen but leave those latter deed we will again return to our purpose chap. 4 1 how gautier raise his siege from Minor and come to Nubia where he repair his army 2 how from thence he come to Luternia where he find jacob who discourse the fortune of montment 3 how gautier go before montment and retake it again by mean of jacob GAutier and his army go before Minor and march to Nubia where he select out ten thousand choice man to repair his loss at which time with great humbleness Huon of Bordeaux take his leave of the king and depart to the great grief of all the company and of he we will speak nothing more at this instant 2 the king at that same time depart from Nubia and come to Luternia where he repose himself the space of four day during which time jacob the merchant come unto he and salute he with a most piteous and fearful countenance say sacred lord of a holy lineage what shall become of we most miserable creature sith the valiant mervin be nnot home return alas alas my lord fortune have double her fortune upon we for in these last two year of your absence the fatal king gorbant of Samaria who be overthrow before Damascus and Bandus come and lay siege before montment have take the city put your highness wife to ^eath and convert fearful to her former religion when gautier feel there thunderbolt strike upon his soul and the death of Claretta name both he and his son fall into a great agony of discontentment vow to God and their soul a deep revengement for that monstrous murder and so forthwith march towards montment but jacob stay behind assemble together four hundred christian who he conduct after gautier with such haste that he overtake he before he have full get sight of montment which instant they have enter without resistance have not a certain pagan espy they who run into the city give king gorbant warn of their approach he upon the first notice muster all his baron together and issue out to meet the christian who then be within a league of the town wall 3 the pagan be order in battle say among themselves alas alas these christian be come to their funeral for sith mervin be dead it be impossible for they ever again to see a day of conquest they be to the number of a hundred thousand and thus quarter Griffoy bear the ensign of Mahomet and have thirty thousand king Bandus have other thirty thousand and griffoner with a regiment to second he gorbant with the rest go before the christian have order themselves though not so huge yet full as strong and thus gautier after encouragement to his son put spur to his horse and give the first charge on the pagan and the first he encounter he bear dead to the ground the second he cut off by the head after he a other and a other and desi^^ing till x. fall by his sword before he at this begin a clamorous noise great than thunder from heaven and the battle be mighty confuse gorbant if his arm have be excellent employ his virtue in valour have inherit little better than excellent by let his deed pass we will speak of jacob who follow gautier with four hundred christian and see the fearfulness and hugeness of the battle say unto his soldier gentleman this day it behoove we to be most circumspect what we take in hand you do see the rare mightiness of the battle and the equality of puissance let we then advise ourselves what way be best for our general profit which in my conceit be this while the two army be thus equal busy we will assault the town now utter undefended and make our entrance therein put man woman and child to the sword that will not fall down and adore the name of Christ jesus to this with clamour they all agree and forthwith enter the town which be leave ungarded and begin to put to ^he sword all with who they encounter but the fearful people soon render to mercy and accept a second baptism the jacob go to the castle of Turgon with his follower where he find Guyda and barrant her little son surname the cruel and berea to who jacob say madam great and infinite be the mischief that hang hover over thy head if so soon thou have forget prince mervin and renounce the christian true law of salvation ha jacob say with a weep face chide i not for in my heart I adore nothing but that true God of my salvation what else I have do this life which only I love but for his love have with carefulness draw i hereto you make i proud qd jacob with these word know then I have take with these my follower both the town and this castle wherefore I will leave two hundred to guard you and with the rest return to the great battle this say he take his leave and after safe order take for the town and castle he return to the tumult where he show himself to be a most resolve and courageous gentleman who resolution when gautier see he commend exceed with promise of great honour my lord say jacob my beginning have be better than my proceed for I have take both the city and Turgon wherefore if you doubt your success you may make your retreat therein for it be your own assure when gautier hear this he dance for joy and in that place create he knight kiss his cheek and pray for his endless good fortune jacob so proud with these honour that the first pagan that he meet he send dead to the ground and then rush into the heart of the army make wondrous destruction which king gorbant behold enrage he run against he and give he such a blow that he fell he to the earth by mean whereof the good jacob be take prisoner and now come the battle to the extreme hazard for the pagan be a hundred thousand and the christian but twelve thousand the great number prenailed wherefore gautier command a retreat to be sound and so retire into the city at the sight whereof gorbant tear his hair and be mad enrage not leave to assault the town on each side but in vain for in his despite it be strong maintain when as arm and fury be lay at rest gautier go to the palace where repose himself he make inquiry for jacob but not any can tell of he or his fortune good God say he shall we lose that good knight be it possible that virtue shall so soon vanish and with that he shed tear for affection this while guyon go to Guyda and take she by the hand say fair lady how come your fortune to hale you into this coast and who be this infant you bear with you ah guyon say she it be my son but I pray you how do your brother Bertran o he be mighty false to i at Damascus when leave i along he esteem more his sword than my honour for hateful revenge whereof I instant marry king gorbant his great enemy thus she discourse her adventure to guyon while her husband and Griffoy without the city stand tear their hair for their loss after some consultation hold they send for jacob and tell he that if he will go to montment and persuade gautier to send he forth of the city his wife and young son he will deliver all the Christian prisoner that be that day take jacob glad of these word for he mighty fear death say willing I will perform thy desire so I may have sufficient pledge for the truth of thy promise then gorbant call Bandus Griffoy and grifoner and send they for hostage of his word so they come into montment and find gautier in the palace jacob deliver the message o^ gorbant which be most welcome to gautier who deliver to jacob guyda and barant and detain the pledge for his return who come to gorbant with a comely reverence deliver they to their lord who on other part deliu^red unto he all the christian that be prisoner who he bring triumphant into the city and enfranchise the hostage who solemyne swear by Mahomet never to raise their tent till they have once again make themselves commander of the city but their dove be witness against they for gautier night and day so soldierlike defend the town that all their assault prove utter frustrate and so we will leave a while to speak more of they and return to Bertran and Drohes who we leave imprison at Minor and have so continue three year during which space they be by the beautiful singlay both regard favour and esteem have their desire accomplish as soon as they can desire so mighty do she love Bertran and so willing she be her will shall make it manifest only their escape that can not be invent so great be the envy of the nation against they chap. 5 of the gallant life that Bertran and Drohes lead in Minor 2 of the Tourney which be proclaim for the love of singlay 3 of the private wonder Bertran do joyous and even in the height of contentment live Bertran and Drohes prisoner in the city Minor serviceable attend on by singlay and a lady of she name adain who secrecy exceed the private conjecture singlay be the love of Bertran and adain the love of drohe for who sake they effect whatsoever can be desire in this same time there arrive at minor a ambassador from montment who report to Mermont the take of his city by gorbant and the loss of it again to gautier and his son which when he understand he go to Butor and hold a council how they may recover it and in the end agree to crave aid of all the pagan king at that time survive which they do and gain infinite among which come one gallant gentleman the son of king Belmarine of the age of eighteen year who bring with he eighteen thousand and have to name Baham exceed wise and high renown for deed of arm and feat of renown chivalry he be mighty enamour with the beauty of singlay and demand she in marriage but she neglect his suit have no other thought but what she borrow from the most excellent Bertran but Baham not omit any thing that may inflame the coldness of her affection cause a solemn tournament to be proclaim before the chamber of his heart mistress the fair singlay to the end that she may behold his prowess thither resort many redoubt pagan to the joust that be in the honour of singlay the while marant her ever-hating brother torment his thought with busy they to find out the reason why she disdain a man of so good a perfection and in the end conclude that of necessity she either love some pagan prince or some Christian for she be a woman and woman will love and no doubt but she be in love with that Bertran enter into his mind who then be his sister prisoner so that he swear by Mahomet it be so and no otherwise wherefore upon the day of the tournament the traitor private hide himself in his sister chamber not see of any one 2 even now be all the pagan arm that come to that gallant sport of honour and all the lady flock to the window to the end they may behold the adventure among who singlay will not consort herself but say for that time her chamber shall be her scaffold thither she go and thither she bring Bertran and Drohes to behold and laugh at what herself deride no soon be Bertran in her chamber but take singlay in his arm he cast she upon a rich embroider couch where h^ make

they without but shadow of foolish ceremony this say he loc^^ she in his arm and with kiss and those delight that exceed kiss woo till they both be conquer drohe on the other side be not behind with his triumph make adain blush and swear she be by love power conquer alas alas a^ this while they little imagine the traitor marant to be in her chamber who like a dumb mischief lay and note all that pass between they now have do dalliance the lady go to the window to behold the joust and the two knight behind they cry aim to other virtue till such time that a herald at arm run cry up and down the field that Belmarine Baham have vanquish all comer and to have to equal in the deed of knighthood when singlay have hear the king at arm make this proclamation she smile say to Bertran look what a gallant prince I have refuse for your love draw upon i the wrath of my father for neglect his offer who equal for chivalry live not betwixt this and Brandis Bertran to this speech make no reply but the aid of adain who for drohe love will hazard any thing he withdraw himself private get armour and a excellent horse on the which be mount he trot to the place where the joust be solemnize who first approach singlay severe note and call to Bertran but adain tell she he be go to his solitary chamber a little trouble in heart intend for some hour to give repose to his unquiet at that singlay turn she sweet speech to drohe and say see fair knight what a comely champion be new enter the list believe i this person promise wonder but his bad furniture say he shall be pnre in virtue believe i I marvel whence he come madam say adain that best know the adventure the foul muscle have the rich pearl and a diamond set in iron be more precious than a pearl in gold with the curious workmanship the poverty of his arm may cover a virtuous spirit and he may prove more redoubt than the best in the assembly therefore do not blame but attend his fortune neither do I say singlay yet give i leave to smile at the attempt for his have furnish estate must needs cause laughter 3 as they be thus talk Baham of Belmarine set forth himself to the joust but will not run against Bertran because the band of his furniture be a assurance as he think of no defence and his death nor price of honour yet notwithstanding Bertran thrust himself forward which Boham see say to his companion there be not remedy but I must encounter yond silly half arm creature wherefore I will only overthrow he from his horse and that shall be his penance which say he put spur to his beast and Bertran on the other side meet he with such a encounter that light upon bahams breast with his lance he overtheew horse and man to the ground backward at which the lady laugh exceed and singlay see the blow laugh much more than any other and call drohe say tell i sweet knight how shall I take this to see a poor half arm villain overthrow my love he that have protest these arm in my honour madam say drohe he be a villain that

somewhat grieve so that come to singlay he humble desire she that he may be arm that if any mischance shall befall they that he may be able to defend she she instant consent and he be arm vow if any cross chance befall Bertran he will be his partaker Bertran by this time have overthrow three king and Baham that be remount who Bertran twice have overthrow swear by Mahomet the three time ot try his success against the poor arm creature which do Bertran overthrow he with such vehemency that with the fall he break one of his leg asunder leave he on the ground dead to all man imagination so that the herald with one voice cry the poor arm knight be the most valiant knight in the world when singlay hear this honourable exclamation she desire adain to call Bertran to behold the poor knight she reply that he be at his rest and it will offend he to be disturb now while every one be busy about Baham Bertran depart out of the list unperceyve of any one but only adain who go unto he and help to unarm he and bring he to singlay who fearful of his health ask he how he fare madam say he better than before I be glad say she but I be sorry you be not here where you may have s^ene a man all in

traitorous marant when he see his time issue out of the chamber and report those thing which after return to such mischief upon himself that be be the end of all his glory chap. 5 1 how marant accuse

Bertran for two such as marant this day shall not prevail against thou he be perfect know a traitor and his treason against mervin be yet a testimony let that be thy heart quarrel and that shall give thou honour with victory it be true it be true say Bertran and I have write it on the table of my memory then mount he on his horse and drohe deliver he his lance then be trot to the list where he find marant arm at all point and expect his come at who approach Butor descend and ask if their cause be just or no and they both answer they be then the trumpet sound and they charge each other

thou will so far prevail with thy father that he will deliver prince mervin from his monstrous alas answer marant it be utter impossible for the prison wherein he live be such yea and so strange as there be not any so subtle or fortunate that can approach it unless they speak with his keeper who be no man but a airy devil with who only my father have conference touch his imprisonment when Bertran hear he say thus he whisper to himself by heaven these pagan be all divelles therefore I will not take one of they to mercy whereupon lift up his sword and think to dispai^h the traitor he stay his hand and descend from his horse lest marant shall slay he under he and marant in the mean space get the ^^uncheon of a lan^^ think therewith to thrust he through but he fail by (@) of bertrans return who with his sword give he such a blow that he fell he to the ground and then leap upon he he disarm his head from his shoulder so that his soul forsake her un^allowed mansion and in that same moment both it and his body be miraculous bear thence into hell to the ^earefull terror of all the beholder who conclude he to be execrable and damn this finish Butor come and embrace Bertran give he singlay to wife do he all the honour possible Mermont do as much and all the other pagan prince make a festival for his conversion in religion great banquet be make and Bertran be set at the table next to the king who vaunt that now there be not a kingdom in Christendom which he will not conquer then kiss his daughter he bless the time of her generation say now she shall be the empress of the world for her husband with twenty thousand gallant he will give he shall present go conquer France she be proud to hear those speech yet neither in show nor in word will express it but protest that if it have not be Mahomet commandment she never will have marry then be Caliph the call for who incontinent marry they according to the old profane custom of Mahomet chap. 7 1 how Bertran and Drohes under the pretence of paganism bring forty thousand pagan before montment 2 how the most part of they be there confound and put to the sword thus under the veil of infidelity Bertran and Drohes abuse the pagan who very imagine that they have renounce Christ jesus but it fall out far otherwise as you shall understand when Bertran have espouse singlay doubt not of the royal solempnity which continue for the space of eight day at the end whereof Butor deliver to he forty thousand resolve man at arm and desire he with all expedition to go aid the mighty king gorbant who have for three year lay siege against montment but can not prevail to this he willing condescend swear withal that he and drohe also will exalt Mahomet where yet never any God be adore but my lord quoth he I humble beseech you before I go let i see the prisoner mervin and on my life I will also convert he again to our true religion my son quoth Butor desire it not for it be altogether impossible because it I do grant it be my death in that I ^ave promise so much to the devil Mutafier who daily administer unto he and effect what be fit for his be then say Bertran I will no more desire it so muster up his man he depart from Minor singlay adain drohe and Mermont go with he hope of that which be without hope I mean to regain his city so continual be their march that now they be come to Brandis where they rest themselves that night in which drohe ask Bertran what course they shall take to destroy those dog those unbelieved infidelel instant say Bertran I know not but we will private give my father

gorbant and feign to deliver up the town on condition that they may have leave quiet to pass into France make he believe their poverty be so great they can no long endure war fury which when he understand he will fall to his regardless humour then shall Bertran and Drohes cause great feast and banquet to be make during who Cupp^^ and triumph we will with all our power issue forth and if fortune favour we make a end of our bad fortune this agree upon they deliver it to adain who take her leave depart in the mean sapce gautier dispatch other letter to gorbant who have then with all the

have do most damnable but if he believe not in Mahomet our god ere long time I will be his murderer because he shall not scandal i with the name of a bastard turn these speech adain come and salute king gorbant after her gautiers ambassador who present his lord letter which when gorbant have read he cry pagan rejoice for before two day be compass we will be commander of the city gautier offer to deliver it so he may safe return into France but it be not our pleasure for neither he nor any of his adherent shall escape unpunished thus do king gorbant boast who little know the news that adain bring who private deliver a letter unto Bertran from his father which when he have read he show it to drohe than they two agree to arm themselves under their doublet which they do and then go into king gorbant tent desire that for the happiness of the news there may be a festival proclaim and solemn banquet and jubily make through all the camp with proclamation that for that day no man on pain of death shall put on a armour or wear a sword but consecrate all his deed with mirth to Mahomet gorbant though this motion convenient and forthwith send his edict and proclamation abroad which be fulfil 2 gautier the holy Dane all this while be within montment prepare his host in a readiness only stay the return of a espial who he have send to bring he word when the pagan be set at dinner long it be not but he come and ^ad he in the name of God issue forth for the pagan be all set and triumph careless of all manner of danger whatsoever this be say gautier leave the city have in his army but only ten thousand soldier which be all his remainder and make so great haste that they enter the pagan camp to the dismay of their adversary gautier with his sword naked enter into gorbant tent and come close to the table where Bertran sit who when he behold his father arm overthrow the table and catch a battle axe in his hand which be there he strike king gorbant such a blow betwixt the neck and the shoulder that he divide his head from his body at which fight all the pagan be amaze but griffoner of Damascus cry Bertran this day by treason will be our destruction and then take barant and his sister he flee away with twenty attendant who we will leave to their flight and return to the battle which begin in gorbant tent and so general through all the camp in which scarce a pagan or Sarazen survive mighty be the resolution of Bertran and glorious to behold his valour who none dare encounter and from who none escape Mermont who before time have lose his hand see this unmovable misery cry woe and alas we be all betray ha lovely singlay thou and this adain be mistress of our sorrow now by the heavenly virgin quoth singlay thou have but thy own deserve for by treason thou betray virtue and than thyself there be not a great traitor remember it be now twelve year since thou do mock Christianity to which I be convert and most false betray the most exquisite mervin unto a torment hell that have no end record that mischief and confess what thou deserve as she be thus speak Bertran rush in upon Mermont and say villain now shall thy life render i account for the loss of the world pa^agon excellent mervin and then with his axe he cleave he to the shoulder this space accompany with many pagan flee to the sea for safety while the christian range in their tent put all to the sword that remain in brief in this battle be slay above a hundred thousand pagan and but three and twenty christian and they of no other esteem than private soldier the christian also take v. hundred prisoner so that of all the heathen army escape but four thousand which flee away with Guida that sorrow most extreme for the death of gorbant her lord and husband and have no contentment but the escape of her young son who swear in his infancy by Mahomet that the time shall come he will be revenge of Bertran both for this and his mother ancient abuse which indeed come to pass for he live to be both the death of his father and all his famous uncle but let that pass till fit opportunity of discourse now it fall out that after this discomfiture the christian do return to the pagan pavilion where they find infinity riches which be so equal divide that the poor soldier get the title of a rich merchant after this they go into the city and make great feast and triumph then in royal manner be singlay adain and all the other prisoner baptize and gautier take a oath to pursue his enemy even to the wall of Damascus but he fail as you shall see in the next chapter chap. 8 1 how a ambassador come to gautier who bring he word that the emperor Charlemagne have destroy all his country of Denmark 2 how drohe go to deliver mervin and how gautier arrive at maiance in the first part of this history you may remember how discontent Charlemagne depart from mervin and gautier for the hate of Huon of Bordeaux who gautier then among his son maintain and how he vow in despite of gautier to make all maiance and Denmark l^ment that ever they know he which indeed he do so mighty be the malice then reign in he wherefore the noble man of that country dispatche^ a ambassador unto gautier to give h^m to understand of their trouble who arrive at montment and come into the palace where he find his king he ^ell upon his knee and a^ter ^uch holy reverence as belong to his estate say my sacred and imperial sovereign know that the nobility of maiance by i salute thy highness and give thou to understand that the great Charles of France in despite have ruin thy country and banish from thy court all by royal countryman wherefore by i they entreat your majesty with speed to return and staunch the wound yet fresh bleed else hereafter it will be too late and thou utter dispossess of a kingdom when gautier have hear this message he rouse himself and with a frown gesture reply as I breathe I will not sleep out this injury but come with such a host as shall make Charles dear repent it and then he cause proclamation to be make through all the city that every soldier on pain of death shall in the morning be ready to be embark for maiance which be perform then he call jacob give unto he the government of the city and sad Mathaburn a leave a sufficient garrison and take a oath for his trust and ^ealtie 2 to be brief every one in the morning be ready to depart but only drohe who refuse and say to gautier that he have vow never to manage other action or embrace one quiet thought till he have find the mean for Meruins delivery which when his love adain hear she say she also in that will be his companion but he gainestoode she say the pain will be too mighty but she will not be refuse though he judge true for she be slay by Griffoy as you shall hear in the story gautier see their resolve give they leave and so depart from they embark himself to who the wind be so prosperous that he arrive in safety near to maiance where he find Dion of Nantuell his near kinsman who though he have lie long sick most joyful receive both he and his son declare what evil Charles have do since his come all which Bertran vow or to mend or to revenge then summon they all their friend and kindred to their aid amount to the number of twenty thousand all of the line of Oger which with those that gautier have bring make the army thirty thousand and better than duke dardain advise they to send ambassador to Charlemagne to request restitution for the wrong before pass which if he refuse they to pursue they with revenge even unto the Louvre in Paris to this advice they accord yet Bertran will not leave but march day and night till he come within the sight of the french army execute as he go all who he find traitorous or false to their country intend to raise the siege which Charlemagne hold before the castle of Nantuell but a traitor of maiance understand it go before and advertise the emperor which as soon as he understand he call the duke of Dampmartin name and the rest of his nobility to council in which consultation duke name persuade all peaceable condition lay before their eye the profit of their concord and the ruin of Christendom by their fatal warfare withal tell the emperor that the most of his own baron be descend from gautier pedigree and in nature will aid he before he shall miscarry Charles grow enrage at his word and swear by the god of paradise to put all those to a shameful death that offer to stir their foot before two month be expire or aid he not to lay waste that fatal country thus speak Charlemagne but the good duke name leave not his persuasion till there be a truce take for 2 year during which time spring a new warfare that wound all Christendom by barant surname the cruel who Bertran beget of Guyda now 5. year old and by the pagan that cross the sea come into Christendom of which barant make a piteous slaughter house in that none be able to endure his force as you shall hear hereafter in the mean space we will to our former occurrent chap. 9 1 of the great battle which be between the emperor and gautier in which Charlemagne be take prisoner 2 how joy the son of Charles come with a great power against maiance to revenge his father the two year expire for which the truce be afore take betwixt the good emperor Charles and gautier by the mean of traitorous conspirator which be about the emperor new seed of discontentment be sow and he command all his baron to attend he to maiance of which gautier be advertise who desire all his friend to be heedful of their evil now depart the emperor from Paris vow never to return into France if he bring not gautier and his son to their funeral and soon arrive within two league of maiance which when gautier by his espial understand he muster his friend and march to meet his enemy who power be divide into ten bata^llions and when he be come within sight of they after speech of encouragement brave they charge each other and come to handy blow cruelty and terror come from hell to learn more misery than have be see in former age great be the resolution of Charles that day who slay ten in a breathe moment none escape who his sword bless gautier on the other side be not behind for true magnanimity neither Bertran or any of his brother who like mad man make havoc of all with who they encounter anon Bertran meet with the emperor and with a battle a^e which he bear he strike he such a blow on his helmet that he field he from his horse and that with such heavy virtue that for all the gold of the earth he be not able to rise to regain liberty but force perforce be take prisoner which the duke of Britain see he cry courage great king and thou shall soon be redeem with that he and all the flower of France assail Bertran who so brave defend himself that in that conflict he fly the duke of Britain many time be the emperor remount and unmount so infinity courageous be the four brother gautier their father in a other part of the field make many horse masterless and many master senseless so fortunate be his sword and so lucky his resolution this battle continue exceed long christian against christian self law against self law and colour against colour the king of England who come in the aid of Denmark that day do wondrous deed of knighthood but king Charlemagne frantic of see his loss range here and there till he meet with thyerrie the son of gautier who with joyous his good sword he s^ue at the fi^st encounter Bertran lion-like affright the amaze flock of the french man before he only to find Charles and no other who so soon as ever he encounter he fell from his horse with a blow and there present have slay he if his father who be always exceed wise have not withhold he say it be a sin most capital to slay the brave champion in the world or touch the blood of the holy anoint wherefore take he prisoner with a strong guard they convey he to maiance the frenchman no soon see their king surprise but they betake themselves to flight at which gautier rejoice and disdain to pursue they but forthwith go to maiance where he make procession and triumph for his victory and the take of the famous emperor Charlemagne to who be before he he say sacred and high esteem king of France immortal be the wrong which I have indur^d by you and just have the king of king inflict this deserve shame on your dishonour both for these injust action and for exile without cause the jewel of thy kingdom from their native coutry know therefore thou shall never escape from this thraldom till thou have make i a sufficient restitution and weep thy wrong from thy soul bitterness by my crown say Charles I will never do it and if thou do not deliver i thou act unjust because thou be swear my liege man and subject as thus they be argue a esquire enter into the hall his eye blubber with weep who turn himself to gautier tell he of the death of Thierrie which Bertran no soon hear but heave up his battle axe he think and have ^^aine king Charles bu^ his father catch he in his arm withhold he say fie son fie why seek thou to kill the good emperor or to s^aine thy honour by kill in cold blood thy brother death be the chance of war and

be say king Charles be enclose in a strong tower and with he four and twenty other prisoner which do gautier cause Thierry to be solemn inter and all the rest that be slay with he in the battle the while duke name and those that escape by flight repair home to their own country 2 the duke name as soon as he enter into Paris report to joy the son of Charlemagne the imprisonment of his father who

a hundred and fifty thousand resolve soldier with which he depart from Paris and come to deep where he take ship and make for Denmark where we will leave he and speak a little of barant surname the cruel who by this time be grow so mighty that not any horse have ability to sustain he and yet the tyranny of his mind do exceed the monstrousness of his body for he cause his own mother to be behead because in a discontenter humour she call he bastard at which inhuman slaughter many repine but he slay they eaeri^ one that do but give a show of displeasance so that through his terror all the pagan become obedient to his will with a great army of man he go before montment and win it both by assault and devilish art for the same night that he slay his mother the damn fiend Mutafier appear unto he and make a co^enant with he that he shall never for any thing whatsoever renounce the law of Mahomet to which he willing agree for joy whereof muta^ier triumph and say he shall be the destruction of all Christendom promise that he shall never die by the hand of any man have be nurse by the milk of woman this promise make barant proud for he imagine that there can not be any infant bring up without the milk of a woman wherefore he hold and repute himself ever invincible when barant the cruel have take montment he put jacob to death and all those that trust in the true God of all thing who again deny as you shall hear hereafter chap. x. 1 how barant surname the cruel depart from montment with three hundred thousand soldier and pass the sea towards maiance 2 how Charles and gautier make a peace and join against the pagan when barant have bring all montment to his subjection he go to the palace where he find the most beautiful and demand of she whether she will adore Mahomet or

my lord quoth he your fault and for very shame ask pardon at these word barant go unto she and demand if she will forgive he yea my lord quoth she when you bring Charles and mervin to be my prisoner thank gentle lady reply he and forthwith he cause a trumpet to be sound and summon his army depart towards maiance where by the aid of devil and fury he arrive at the port ten league from the city where he begin to sack burn and destroy all the country as he go show himself a monstrous devilish tyrant and no man the poor countryman that see their house burn and their wife and child die run to gautier and tell he of the hideous ruin which the pagan make in the country lay it waste like a forsake wilderness their number be great than any eye can account these amaze word raise the blood from

France and his french army who do pitch their pavilion close to the walle^ be at that time ignorant of the pagan come 2 it be think most convenient by gautiers counsel that the emperor Charles shall be deliver that with his aid he may help to beat back the pagan which be perform and ganty with honny-dipped word entreat the emperor favour say he think the heaven be displease with their disagreement for that within those day there be arrive in his kingdom above three hundred thousand pagan who have already conquer Mequa jerusalem Babylon and all those country before (@) by meruine^o

conclude the reason and the general good that shall thereby be get then he his son duke name and the rest return into the city who gautier and his son meet in most solemn order and conduct through the street every one do honour to Charlemagne and so bring he to the palace where with unspeakable joy they repose after they the whole army march and be receive and lodge in the city then the king and prince go to counsel touch their weighty war affair in which it be conclude that the town shall be victual and man for many year so the tediousness of siege shall not prevail against they also it be agree that prince joy and Bertran with twenty thousand shall lie in a ambush that when the pagan have pitch their tent before the town they in the dead of the night shall assail they and either overthrow or dissever the army all they conceive ^it they put in practice and the ambush be lay in a great wood by which of force the pagan must pass who abo^^ high noon come march in such invincible troop that the way hardly can contain they in the last rank of all march a king who name be gamart of mo^tiurne and king of juerne the great with he march a gentleman of his country who be almost all naked and the king himself have his head and foot bare these carry in their hand bough which they use in battle and no other weapon their strength be their swiftness for they run fast than hare when

new spirit and fight like a god of conquest barant the cruel be not this while idle but slay the christian by two and two together so that the most resolve in the army dare not abide he but begin to convert retreat to plain fly which gautier with grief behold demand a reason for their faintness to who a french man make answer there be a devil in the pagan host who fury be not possible to be endure gautier desire to see he the french man with pure fear bring he to behold he to who gautier cry traitor stay and give my sword account for thy murder and so say he strike he upon the headpiece so strong that the blow glance hurt barant in the thigh at which the tyrant be high enrage turn and say villain thou have hurt i but thy life shall be my plaster and at that word lift aloft his sword ^e cut off one of gautier hand and the sword that be grasp in it which when the good king see spur^ing his horse he overthrow both barant and his hor^^ to the earth in which mean space a pagan come behind he give the christian king such a blow on the helmet that he cleave he to the chap and he fall down dead without motion then begin the christian to fly here and there about the field for safe^y at which confusion Charlemagne sigh and after many holy prayer (@) thrust himself amongst his enemy more (@) than before of his army be not leave alive but five thousand and the most of those fly ^nd not fight ^ the which duke name perceive he persuade the emperor to let a retreat be sound which as he be intend to have do one bring to he word that gautier be slay so that both grieve and enrage he fly upon the king of who but then have slay a christian and with the first stroke cleave he to the collar 2 the die battle at this seem to recover but yet can it not continue so weak be the overmaistered christian wherefore the sun have get the middle point of the heaven Charles make a retreat be sound and return into the city which barant behold he present cause engine to be make with which he cast into the city Bertran at all point so arm as he be when he live the sight of who renew afresh b^th the grief of Charles and the rest of the city this do with the same engine he do cast huge stone and rock into the town kill diverse of the burgher as they walk in the street whereupon the rest go to the emperor and tell he they have rather issue forth and die fight than live in this danger of continual fear and so they then ^hewed what huge stone by engine be hourly throw upon they friend quoth Charles all your will shall be satisfy and with that he issue with all the power of the city the second time and first assail the engina^^ they t^re they in piece to the earth and put all those to the sword that use they and then make towards the army they overthrow their tent and cast down their pavilion put a urry great number of pagan to death in a moment now enter Charles into the tent of the king of Danubia who he slay and pass on wi^h exceed great triumph until the pagan make a hideous cry raise up all the camp who flock about the christian begaune a intolerable battle in this stir be king Charles overthrow and have be take but for duke name once again who in despite

son joy name and diverse other christian be take prisoner which when he understand he will have tur^ed again to their rescue but his noble will not suffer he because they prize his life as a holy relic and for that cause force perforce they bring he to the palace the most discontent king then live while the pagan themselves carry joy and the rest to barant the cruel who take a stormy view of they first ask duke name what he be my lord quoth he my name be Tristram a burgess of this city this be my son these other be my kinsman all at thy mercy yet if ransom may deliver we I will give to you a hundred ton of wine and a hundred quarter of wheat all which I have ready in my house in maiance of which king Charles have no notice for and if he have he will seize it and leave i nothing barant be glad of this offer because his victual be spend and he have reinforce two hundred thousand pagan so that he accept the ransom yet do the duke desire hostage for the performance of their delivery which he have and then go he to the city to Charles who sorrow smile to behold he and tell he what be do which the emperor high commend and forthwith cause theransome to be deliver which when barant have receive he send joy and also the rest home to the city who Charles with very great joy of heart receive and send ba^ke the pagan hostage but it happen present after that there fall such a

but as the story say ere he descend to the ground she be dead so grievous do his talon gripe she to the heart chap. 15 1 how drohe speak to robaster touch the delivery of mervin 2 of Malabeon of luton robaster father that give counsel in the action the monstrous Griffon when he see in his ^^ght adain dead he present devour she for who loss drohe sorrow extreme and mingle with his moan many swooning and many bitter lamentation during which robaster come by and hear he make great moan now for adaine then for mervin he take compassion of his woe and go and salute he say good sir I have hear your outry in which you exclaim for the loss of a wife and a perfect friend be comfort man for destiny be unremovable when drohe hear robaster he lift up his head and with humble reverence he demand of he his name my name quoth he be robaster who have be the death of many pagan yea and of many christian also for which now do my soul endure a mortal penance drohe hear this amongst his woe re^oyced and say ha robaster thou be the star which have lead i hither and in thou be the power of all my joy and happiness then robaster take he up for he be very sore wound he present lead he to his hermitage where Malabeon his father be and cure he but Malabeon go invisible for such be his power and only he be see to his son and to none other when time of repast come they sit down to meat and drohe smell a delicate perfume demand what it be and robaster tell he that they be certain rare water the which he keep in his chamber which if he please he will show he thence he bring he into his chamber which resemble a earthly paradise so rare be the exquisiteness thereof all be do by the art of Malabeon the which drohe in admire praise beyond all measure and robaster that take no small delight in drohe tell he he shall command any thing he see or wherein his help may do he service he vow he shall find it most willing and ready o quoth he will you not hereafter go from your promise not for the world quoth he then will I take you at your word quoth drohe know then that for these five year space the only glory of the world the miracle and mirror of knighthood have be by corrupt and false treason detain and keep prisoner in Minor from which place it be utter impossible that ever he shall be deliver except by the handiwork of almighty God and your good help because a devil of hell be his guardian near unto who no man dare to approach so cruel be his wrathful indignation wherefore I humble pray you that in regard the life of virtue live in your power be dei^^ed in the heart of man for attribute unto her a most happy restitution how I pray you do you call the knight quoth robaster oh answer drohe it be renown mervin the son of Oger of Denmark and the right beautiful and virtuous lady Morgua I have hear quoth robaster of one son of Ogers who be slay by Charles the son of Charlemagne who be call by the name of Baldwine but of mervin I never hear before nor of any of his action 2 then speak Malabeon his father and say son it be very true that Oger beget the valiant prince mervin of the fairy lady Morgua in the fairy land which I know right well that be present at his baptize as the fairy can well witness with i who steal he from his mother and for grief thereof know herself to be damn suffer a devil to beget on she a monster with three head that hereafter shall bring all Christendom to a most woeful heaviness until by that famous and worthy renown prince mervin he be bring unto some shameful end who it behoove thou to deliver because now the date of his destiny be expire and if he be not the soon redeem all Christendom will be utter ruinate by barant surname the cruel against who no creature be able to endure battle except mervin in who hand the tyrant life be contain father quoth robaster by what manner of mean may I work his deliverance very easy answer Malabeon for I will first go alone to Minor and wait the come out of Mutafier who shall not see i steal private away the key of the prison and then return for thou by the help of the high son deliver he good father say robaster help we in this holy deed I will dispatch it and return quoth Malabeon before the day go down drohe hear this overcome with joy embrace robaster in his arm and ask if he ever see his father yes say he but beside myself not any creature in sundry other discourse they continue until Malabeon return from minor with the key and bid they arise for now be the time to go and deliver mervin for behold here be mutafier key when the two baron hear this they leap for joy and drohe marvel that he be so soon return stand not amaze say Malabeon but let we be go for if Mutafier shall chance to return and find his key take away it may be he will do the prince some injury alas say drohe how shall we be able in a moment to go more than a hundred league care not say Malabeon only arm yourselves and do but follow i which they do and then cast pilgrim weed over they go so that no man can possible perceive their armour and at the last come to the river orb over which by the help of Malabeon they pass upon a little plank of wood and then come unto the view of Minor where Malabeon command they that as soon as they shall come before Butor that they shall feign themselves to be come (@) country and that they shall say that barant the cruel have by his prowess take both Charles and the twelve peer assure they that he will stand by they and give advice in every action then afterward in the very dead of the night at what time every creature shall be at their rest we will go to the prison and set renown mervin at liberty before it be midnight this be say they go forward even to the city gate where they remain until the next morning that the sun be rise devise within themselves with what speech to entertain king Butor and when they perceive the day begin to appear they knock at the gate and desire entrance but they answer that without the king majesty knowledge he dare not suffer any man to enter then say robaster go to the king and tell he we have bring he news which will make his highness joyful and at thy return we will give to thou three piece of silver thou speak well quoth the porter and go his way and tell the king who very well remember the entrance of Bertran and Drohes be ever after circumspect of every man entrance wherefore cause about thirty of his best approve knight to arm themselves with they he go to the gate and receive in the two pilgrim and present remember robaster for that he have afore time slay a monstrous serpent which have great waste his country for the which king Butor have promise many a time and often to give he what gift he will desire within compass of any reason chap. 16 1 how robaster deceive king Butor 2 how mervin be deliver out of prison and go to the palace where he slay Butor his queen and diver^ other pagan 3 of the great battle he maintain most honourable be the entertainment that Butor give to robaster imagine that he be come for the gift which in time pass he have promise but it be not so and he feast he and drohe who by reason of his disguise he know not sumptuous but robaster he will not eat any thing but pass the time in tell of strange news and in the end assure he that prince barant the cruel have take the emperor Charles and his 12 peer prisoner at which tiding Butor much joy and kiss robaster for his speech and put his hand under his foot do he vassaile-like reverence whereat drohe smile to himself thus be Butor deceive by robaster and by drohe 2 now when the evening draw on the black curtain of the night and every one betake themselves to their rest the king give cammaundement that robaster and his companion shall be delicate lodge which be very just perform but assoon as old Malabeon know that dead sleep have arrest the thought of every one he come to the two christian say nowell arise if you will deliver mervin for I have the key of the prison at that word they arise and depart the moon shine out the pleasant beam of her countenance and come to the door of the dungeon where stay Malabeon open the door and then say fair son stay thou here till we return and guard this passage I will say robaster and swear that if there come but 100 they shall not escape i they enter in drohe and Malabeon who hear the music which the fairy make thrice a day to revi^e the spirit of mervin as be before write at which drohe wonder until Malabeon tell he what it be and the occasion thereof the music cease they go to mervin that lie in most intolerable martyrdom who as soon as he see drohe he maruelld but drohe overjoy with his sight come to embrace he but can not speak so full be his heart with over-pressing joy but have get a little liberty for his tongue say thou wonder of man behold drohe thy true prisoner who be come to find mean to deliver thou from imprisonment when mervin hear he he embrace he and double kindness upon kindness then Malabeon by virtue of a herb he have break off his fetter and mervin see himself deliver ask drohe what he be that un^eene ta^ked unto he and drohe at large discourse altouching robaster and Malabeon his father who be indeed the true actor of his delivery for without they his bondage be eternal these speech Malabeon break and tell they they m^st depart for why the hour approach in which Mutafier be accustom to come unto the prison by my saviour say mervin I will he be here for of all the devil in hell I desire to combat with he this be say he arise out of the dungeon and come forth who as soon as robaster see he call to mind prince Oger and say believe me^ princely mervin I be hardly persuade that Oger have a son but now I assure myself by thy countenance for one hand be not so like a other as you to his excellence after this Malabeon bring mervin into the chamber where his armour be which he present put on but his sword be not there which somewhat grieve he but in steed of it Malabeon give he a mace of yr^n and then they depart to the king palace where they find every one asleep so that they unforbidden go to the king bed chamber where break op^n the door with their ^e^te the king awake and offer to rise mervin rush unto he and say damn traitor and thou stain of kingdom behold here mervin the son of Oger whos^ very soul thou have torment be now come to take account of thy treason and in so say he strike he with his mace such a merciless blow that in his bed he slay he and robaster at the same instant kill his queen also which do they pass from chamber to chamber and put to death all the pagan they find of what estate soever during all this fearful night not any creature escape but only one base peasant who run into the city give a general alarm cry treason to the king sacred person at which clamour all the town rise up in arm and come to the palace where they find the christian who fly among they begin a dreadful battle and Malabeon by his excellent art make such a light that the palace be as bright as day to to the christian but hell-like black to the pagan who by that mean be slay by their enemy ^^ue also themselves by their ignorance drohe set forward with desire of cevenge be get into the thick of the pagan but th^^^ number be so infinite that all his prowess be much too little to have save his life have it not be for Malabeon who cry to robaster and mervin to succour drohe or he be but dead at that they turn about and press into the throng there be not a pagan that dare abide or endure they so that all three join themselves together they make ha^ocke of their enemy only one thing great breed their trouble which be the cast of scald water out of the window upon they but yet notwithstanding they slay so many that the street be pave with their body then come Malabeon and say prince now be the time to be go therefore sheathe your sword and retire why quoth mervin or for what cause because say Malabeon Mutafier even now be in come and when he shall perceive this slaughter he enrage will set all the city on fire with unquenchable flame so that we nor any pagan shall escape the mischief thus forward the christian depart fight all the way till they be without Minor and without the straight passage than retire the pagan but be no soon re-enter but Mutafier come who when he miss mervin he become mad enrage and with the frenzy of his anger set all the city on fire so that not a pagan escape from burn but only one who then be without the city and immediate bear those sad tiding unto barant the cruel who little or nothing esteem the discourse mervin and his companion be within ^ight marvel at the hugeness of the fire till Malabeon call his son he conduct the prince and aid they in every thing for of force he must pass into the fairy land

to this it be in vain we strive against they during the battle stand on the top of Turgon to behold her lord who she know by his blow and death that follow they and also by a old Favor of she which he do wear in his helmet the battle continue very strong in which mervin show wondron chivalry drohe croysant and Fouchier not be short of any knightly resolution but on the other side Brurant who be on

his sword tha^ he cut away one quarter of his shield and the head of his horse also insomuch that drohe be fain to descend to the earth to begin a foot combat but the Turk who be of strange ^or^e take he up in his arm and in despite of all man bear he into montment deliver he into she custody of the pagan and then return again where he see mervin make a mighty slaughter of his soldier that now be fly to seek safety who as he encounter he say coward whither will you turn or ere night you shall all repent you sir say one of they death be worst and that we be sure of if we turn to yond puissant mighty one which say Brurant show i that gallant I will do that say one of his soldier so you will let i come behind you and then he show he where mervin be to who he go and offer to strike he with his axe the horse passant see the blow retire and instant turn again whereby mervin give the Turk such a mighty blow that if his sword have not break he have there finish the battle then he take the pommel and hilt which he cast at he so vehement that he bring he on his knee and then take his iron mace from he with it give h^^ such a blow that he fell he to the earth then come a infinite number of pagan about he who raise he up and as soon as he be come to himself he cry let we fly soldier let we fly for it be impossible to endure these strange blow then run the pagan amain towards the town and the christian pursue they of who in the entrance they ^^ue abundance notwithstanding yet the saracen get into the town and close up their gate at which mervin be displease but will have be much more grieve have he know that drohe have be take prisoner the christian go unto their pavilion have lose but seven hundred and the pagan eight thousand 3 Brurant bring to the knight drohe with this speech say madam behold here be one of the christian that have be our scourge this day please your ladyship to keep he and present he to prince barant my lord and master your royal love that will I not say but before to morrow in the morning dispatch he of his life I know his name to be drohe and please it Mahomet that as I have he I have that disloyal mervin who against my soul make i be

for the inconstancy of chap. 19 1 how the city of montment be take by the mean of 2 the delivery of drohe out of prison and other accident small be ^he hope of life retain in drohe after he be imprison and the key carry to the lady that swear in the morning he shall be carry to the gallow madam say Brurant do your own will for my lord barant at his departure command i to obey you in all thing it be true reply she therefore see my commandment be effect and to herself swear all the good possible for the christian mervin by this time have miss drohe make inquiry for he but no man can tell any news wherefore he cause diligent search to be make till a squire come and report that Brurant have bear he prisoner into the city at which word mervin tear his hair lament and swoon till croysant come and persuade he to be appease for be in the city there can no mischance befall he for he know that she be lady and mistress of the town and the proud Sarazin dare not disobey she this give some respite to his moan yet he go and throw himself upon his bed and will not be full comfort in the end he fall on his knee and make a vow to the god of heaven that if it will please he to restore his dear friend drohe he will never sleep on bed exchange apparel drink wine nor eat flesh neither espouse wife till he have pass the sea and slay that inauspitio^s stone of religion false barant the ruin of Christendom this speak mervin so effectual that his desire be grant as you shall hear the beautiful who busy thought be virtue agent when all the pagan be lay at rest she take the key and go to drohe who she no soon see but she embrace and with joy tear demand how mervin do when drohe have hear she he stand amaze and say ah inconstant lady thou have slay i with thy change and art unworthy to speak of he from who thou be change suffice it I know thy intent and my death be welcome mistake i not fair knight say she for by my past thought I protest he be the god of my desire

she conduct he where he be arm and then bid he come away with three hundred of his best knight and I will here attend his come drohe effect all her wish and in brief bring the prince where the lady attend and whoso have (@) their meeting will have marvel and swear that than love there can not be a great godhead he live in she and she in his bosom either embrace the other with such entireness of spirit that as they have but one heart even so they seem to have but one body until drohe call honour from love combat tell they they may hereafter consume age in their happiness but now it be fit to think upon the death of the pagan it be true it be true say mervin and then with all speed they enter and mervin desire to guide he to brurants chamber that I may confess he with this iron mace before he pass to his grave then she lead he to the door and say even here he sleep if you can open it that shall soon be do say mervin and then with his heavy mace he give such a blow that the d^^re break into many piece into the chamber when Brurant hear the sound he say what devil make this noise you be deceive say mervin it be a charitable chaplain that be come to set you the right way to your grave if you refuse to be baptize I have rather say brurant lose my head thy own mouth shall be thy judge say mervin and then heave up his mace he slay he as he lay which see to with a smile she ask mervin how many he have confess in that manner as he pass through the country a world madame say he and then he pass from chamber to chamber and leave not a breathe soul which refuse to be baptize to be brief there be not a pagan leave which come not creep on his knee and beg that he may be baptize this do mervin cause a most royal and triumphant chariot of gold to be make in which he cause to ride and march with he through all ^he country of surry and when those of the thowne of M^qua understand of his come they meet he with the key of their gate three league from the town there after they have rest four day he march to jerusalem in brief after he have convert that mother of city he go to perform his vow and visit the holy sepulchre which also do thence go they to Babylon which he conquer by assault and cause all to be baptize to be short in my discourse in less space than a year and a half he bring to the knowledge of christian religion more than a hundred mighty city all which city he hold under his government and from every one of they take the expert soldier to furnish up his host so that now depart from Babylon he return to montment and then he embark himself for France in which journey we will leave he and return to speak of the emperor Charles and of barant the cruel who continue his siege against maiance chap. 20 1 how barant challenge combat of Charles himself alone against three or five 2 how he overcome all the five you may remember how barant the cruel keep king Charles in maiance who be both besiege with dreadful war and with worse famine want both man to ^ight and fortune to supply be as then in the town thirty person and when barant perceive that the french emperor dare no more give he battle he arm himself and full of pride he go and challenge Charlemagne to send forth three or five of the renowm knight he have to combat with he alone and if they can vanquish he than his unrest shall have end otherwise they shall be thrall to his mercy Charlemagne at this offer stand astonish yet ponder well he promise in seven day to give he a answer in the mean space he consult with his baron but never come to any conclusion the last day as they be in consultation they may hear barant cry at the port where be this Charles of France where be his champion what shall I be combat with yea or no as he speak these word king Charles come upon the wall and tell he that he shall for five knight within be ready for the battle only he desire hostage for performance of the article to that barant accord and send into the city two noble pagan who the king cause to be imprison then issue out of the city arm himself duke name the prince joy young Dion of Nantuell and of Holland they all march on foot for the famine have not leave they a horse to ride on and be come into the list barant enter mount and arm exceed royal who see they on foot demand why they be not on horseback answer be make by Charlemagne that they have not a horse loft alive within the city by Mahomet say barant I will not lose so much honour as to combat with man half arm and therefore instant send for the best horse of his camp and mount they and give they lance into their ha^ds and then sound trumpet they begin the battle 2 most terrible be the first encounter where the christian run all together break their sta^es with such fury that they overthrow both barant and his horse together but he quick recover himself again who enrage for the death of his horse go against the christian with naked in his hand and at the first blow stroke Andri of Holland dead to the ground which see to Charles and the rest all at once brave assault he but with the deafen himself like a man of immortal resolution intolerable be he fight on every side and many prayer Charles make unto heaven but the ear of the almighty be stop against he because of the civil dissension he causeless begin in Danmarke by this time barant strike prince joy with huge force on the helm but the sword turn in his hand lose his pewer of do evil only glance by his shield it fall upon his horse and cut his head from his body so that joy be force to fall and that so unfortunate that the horse fall upon he he be not able to rise again for the world riches which be worse than death to Charles when he behold it who fortune be like his son mischief for at the next blow he cut off the head of his horse but the emperor in a trice recover his foot again but withal be sore wound in one of his thigh and that so mortal that he be force to withdraw from the press which to duke name be worse than poison who follow their footstep in misery be strike from his horse and intolerable wound to Dion the like evil chance who horse slay himself be take prisoner and with he other three who wound leave no force to rule their weapon to be brief they be all imprison in barants tent who triumph at his own glory which he think worthy a godhead but within four day after news be bring to he of meruines army which be then within ten league of his camoe chap. 21 1 how mervin encounter Baham the son of Belmarine with ten thousand pagan that be forage who be all conquer except thre^ 2 how Baham renounce mahomet 3 how the three that escape report the action unto barant who slay one of they for bring such evil news mervin say the history travel with so earnest desire not take rest that he come within ten league of the host of barant the cruel at what time a espial come to he and give he intelligence of a army of pagan to the number of ten thousand that march not far off towards barants camp bear thither abundant store of all manner of provision which he no soon do hear but he tell drohe that it behoove they to be partner of their banquet whereupon he march to a wood by which of necessity they must pass and when they be come within a career thereof mervin give they a brave charge the suddenness whereof amaze Baham but be enforce by extremity he encourage his follower and requite the onset the battle be hot for little space but the intolerable blow of mervin too too much for any man to bear put the poor pagan to their wit end who seek to fly mischief find themselves so enclose with mischief that they be enforce to entertain he as their best unwelcom companion yet amongst all three escape who with the wing of fear be carry beyond fear yet fear be still in their bosom the rest be put to the sword only Baham survive to who prince mervin offer many favour if he will renounce his false god which he utter refuse then mervin with his sword strike he and fell he to the ground and ^^ue his horse under he then flock the christian about he and have slay he if mervin have not be his redeemer 2 when mervin have save Baham from the multitude of sword he offer he again mercy if he will renounce Mahomet Baham see his foo^e in the door of death and all hope flee from his knowledge kneel down to mervin and say wonder of knighthood I yield to thou and give my sword which be my honour to thy dispose vow henceforth to renounce Mahomet and all false god in witness whereof my desire be to be baptize mervin rejoice at these word and take he to favour 3 by this time the three that escape from the christian sword have so haste that they be now come to the pagan host where they find barant the cruel threaten Charles with death if he will not renounce his god and fall down before Mahomet to the which the good emperor give but a little or a careless attention when they be approach they fall on their knee one of they say never to be conquer prince and god of nation know we bring thou heavy and unspleasant news for Baham of and his 10000 follower who thou have send forth to forage about the country be encounter with a heroical christian accompany with a army of redoubt chivalier by who he and his army be all ^laine and discomfit therefore advise your highness what to do for not any man be able to withstand that christian who be undoubted a devil send from the depth of hell and no earthly creature when barant hear this speech he himself and full of more than lunatic ang^r with his fist he strike the messenger dead to the ground for be the author of such bad reporting from whence rise this proverb he be evil come that evil bring the other two see their companion dead flee from his presence and conceal themselves Gribovart his counsellor have chide he for his rashness and with sweet word lay a sleep his anger than be they send for again and barant ask if it be true their fellow have swear and they swear by holy Mahomet it be then grow barants wrath so great that he can not speak of a long time in the end when his word have liberty after many outrageous curse he command the messenger to be imprison vow if the news fall out contrary to make their death a live example then he cause a hundred thousand to arm themselves and march forth to try if it be just or no king Belmarine do conduct they vow to revenge with the death of many thousand christian his son misfortune after their departure Charlemagne and his fellow prisoner fall to argue of this occurrent wonder what christian they shall be that shall undertake this wonderful enterprise as I live say name I can guess who it shall be only this last night I dream that the famous duke Oger be rise again and come to deliver we then say Charlemagne thus do I prophesy God have deliver mervin the son of that mighty one and it be only he that must be our ransom thus talk they as they be in prison of mervin who march on so fast that now he be come within the sight of a hundred thousand that pass on in a most tumultuous disorder chap. 22 1 how barant hundred thousand be overthrow by mervin 2 how barant then come with all his host exeept three hundred and march against the christian when mervin have take a perfect view of the pagan army come towards he he divide his host into three battalion and ride from rank to rank give such encouragement that like the meeting of long absent friend so be war welcome into their bosom this while the pagan like mad man come run one here one there and another in another place in such disorder that join with the christian they be slay like gnat or new bear infant the cry of they be so horrible that it be hear to the camp where barant lay who instant cause every man to be in a readiness but swear not to leave his tent till he have news of the conquest but there remain very few to bring tiding death be so bitter among they of all the pagan king Butifart be most worthy in arm and make the great slaughter of the christian till drohe encounter he at the first blow strike off his left arm^ and at the next cleave his helmet and head down even to his tooth and then beganhe a second outcry which be hear even unto the city of maiance the noise whereof add vigour to the christian heart so that they spare not any but put all to the sword that dare abide a encounter a hundred only escape the rest slay or take prisoner after this conquest mervin call all his army together and after praile give to God he command they to sit down and refresh themselves with victual for he understand by one of his prisoner that at midnight barant be mind to give they new battle when they have refresh themselves mervin retire himself and his army unto a fortify place to which there be but a straight and narrow way for passage where have pitch his tent he take drohe aside and say the reason why I have retire myself be for that we be near our enemy and my army consist of many nation and by much more than I dare whole trust therefore sith there be but this straight entrance to annoy we you and I this night will watch and guard it and 20000 to second we while the rest shall take their repose quiet to this drohe condescend put every thing in execution with great care during the which time the fugitive pagan that be run from the batt^^l make such speed that they come into barants camp cry o prince barant prince barant thou be much too slow in thy revenge for thy army be ruin dead and conquer the christian undoubted have get the god of war from heaven and no mortal man be able to endure his prowess for if he once strike whosoever he touch he be but a dead man what be he quoth barant thou so extolle to be thus famous renown I know not answer the pagan but I have hear they all call his name mervin Charles stand by and hear this can not contain his joy within his own bosom but tell the duke name now be thy vis^^n effect and the renown prince mervin will give unto we free liberty barant on the other part seem to rejoice more than the christian say now shall my fame attain a everlasting crown for to morrow next before the midst of the day I will not leave of all his number one breathe christian. 2 then command a trumpet to be sound he present sommoon all his host together and all his elephant which be infinite in number and with they depart towards mervin leave but only 300. to guard his tent and the emperor with the other prisoner barant himself march the last man and swear by Mahomet that whosoever turn his back for fear of a christian he himself will slay he brief to speak barant at last come where mervin have fortify himself with chariot and other carriage himself and drohe guard the entrance with 20000 soldier all on foot yet with solemnity protest that whosoever will enter shall for his dare presumption forfeit his life for ransom by this time barant army come and assault the chariot and turn they over and over to make themselves a passage at last come to the entrance where mervin and drohe be who make such a slaughter of the infidel as be hideous to behold in brief before the sun arise there be 40000 pagan slay and not one Christian the sun be rise mervin salute it with great joy cause all his trumpet to sound remove three chariot and make way for his army to issue out encourage they so that he think himself unworthy to live that adventure not to die for the honour

courageous be the christian that now the pagan stand amaze and dare not come near either mervin or drohe so dreadful they be all this while wear out her time in pray for the happy estate of her lord mervin who valour so far extend that there be not a pagan of account leave to assail they but now begin to take flight the which barant behold he rail on Mahomet till a certain king come to he and say o my lord why be you now leaden foot or so ^low to enter into the battle look look how your people be conquer and only two be lord of this great triumph barant will not hear a end of his speech but like a hungry wolf put sput^es to his horse and charge his lance run in amongst the christian with such violence that he throw he dead to the ground at the first encounter but when his lance be break he draw his sword and with it do miracle upon miracle kill all that eve^ he touch which when the christian see they begin to flee from one side of the ^^eld unto a other but still he pursue they make

and earnest desire to go into jewrie to plant true religion in that country which he do yet it be a tedious time before wherefore for a while we will leave he and speak of Gratiana the fairy who fall desperate for her evil deed towards mervin chap. 25 1 how Mutafier deceive the fairy Gratiana and beget of she a monster name ork that have three head 2 and of other accident as the story say in that part that by succeed time the christian live without war the remembrauncer of sin they begin to commit diverse outrageous and damnable offence against the majesty of God at the which Mutafier triumph make their fall a stair to his glory wherefore he go to the wood where that desperate fairy Gratiana remain and come to a poor cottage where she live he take upon he the likenese of a woman and knock at the door which the fairy open desired^lodging for that night with she to which Gratiana give consent so he stay there beat his thought how he may work some notable mischief anon as they be set to repast Gratiana ask whither she be travel all alone unaccompanied fair sister say the devil Mutafier know that I and my company have live in a wilderness in great poverty have nothing but bread and water till they all be dead but I only reserve for who I sorrow and think to have lead my life in continual solitariness till two learned clerk tell i that such a kind of life be damnable after that they demand of i whether I be a maid or wife or have in my life time accompany with any man and I tell they never for which cause they blame i exceed approve by the sacred scripture that the woman that live without the knowledge of man shall not see the fa^e of God many other thing they tell i until one of they for charity sake accompany i and take my sin upon he alas q^ Gratiana what shall I do my sin be infinite i will take they upon i say Mutafier in brief so earnest he tempt she and beget of she a most ugly and deform three head monster thence he convey she into a vast and strange wilderness where never mortal footstep be before discover and there she be deliver of her abortive fruit which wa^ call ork because in that desolate habitation be not to be see any thing by 3 head monster call ork 2 this new bear monster have more than the strength of six man two of his head look forward and the three behind he every head have a beard his eye be like melon and in his mouth tooth three finger long and in a monastery at civil in Spain at this hour be his picture which king joy cause to be draw and erect there in honour of prince mervin his sword be keep there for a divine relic this divel-begot monster within twenty day become so fierce and uncontrollable that he overcome all those of the forest wherefore Mutafier his father give he arm almost impregnable and command he to go into France where if he find mervin he charge he to bear he such deadly hatred that he shall not rest till he have bring he to a shameful end and also that he shall spare no christian till he have lay the country utter desolate yet before thou go say he go unto king turniquant of and entreat his aid to go with thou which his damn son do according but when he be once come within all the pagan come and hide themselves for fear of his presence from thence he march towards the palace where they lock up the gate and tell the king of the ork arrival who laugh at their cowardi^e until he hear the ork cry ^o they to open the gate or he will destroy the city the king as then be set at a table with his daughter beat^ce who in private be bring to be a Christian by her nurse have instruct she in all the point of Christian religion chap. 26 1 how the king turniquant of assemble a great number of his people and go in aid of the ork 2 how he destroy all Normandy and Bri^taine 3 and of other occurrent when king turniquant hear the clamour of the ork he arise from the table and go to the gate where see the hugeness of the monster a tremble fear come over his body yet with feign speech he entreat he to do he no hurt and he will perform whatsoever he command he I ask nothing say the ork but that thou will be my subject and I will conduct thou into France where I will utter destroy the country if they will not return and believe in Mahomet when as turniquant hear these word he exchange fear into rejoice and make the gate to be set open and with great honour bring the monster into his palace where the fairy Beatrice be who the ork at the first sight demand of her father and in recompense he will give he the crown of France all the which turniquant be proud of but the poor lady go and lament exceed now with all speed that can be the king muster up his man to the number of two hundred thousand with which the ork and he pass carry the fair Beatrice with they to jerusalem which he so quick conquer thence he go unto Babylon and do the like and to all the other christian country even to montment where they give a strong assault against which drohe be not able to endure so the town be take yet by the providence of heaven drohe escape who fly into a wilderness consume his life in great poverty thus the ork subvert what mervin have plant not leave a church or monastery which be not utter race 3 thence conduct by the devil aid he come to saint Michael mount in France and thence march through base Normandy and base Britain thence to high Normandy make all place both waste and desolate the news whereof wound king Charles chief when he hear the description of the monster yet he assemble his man at arm to go against he but not with such expedition but that the false ork and the pagan be first come to Montmarre where it be pitiful to behold with what cry the poor people run into Paris one carry his bed another his coffer some their wife and some their child 3 by this time Charles bring down his army and set upon the ork and turniquant between who be a long and dreadful battle Charles slay a number of pagan with his own hand cry ever saint Dennis and good fortune this day shall the pagan perish the good duke name do as much and upon his enemy show wonderful feat of knighthood overthrow here one and there another so that it be excellent to behold the fall of the pagan but this triumph endure but a moment for the strong king turniquant and the false ork in less than a hour overthrow every soul of they because the parisian upon sight of the three head monster flee away and dare not one of they endure in battle so that the emperor be compel to sound a retrayt and be the first that enter into the city of Paris so hideous be the behold of the devil infant and all the christian follow who the ork in pursuit slay five upon five and twenty upon twenty to the piteous amazement of all man in this chase the ork have enter the city but for especial regard but find himself deceive he cry at the ga^es false traitor Charles come forth and bring twenty with thou against i alone or if they be not ^now bring thirty and myself will give they battle thus triumph he in his own pride but before any long time expyre a single man shall bring his three head to a funeral which can be none other but the famous king mervin as you shall hear Charles all this while be mighty perplex and not causeless for of all that he have bring there be no more leave alive but thirty thousand neither dare Charles the space of a year look abroad for fear of the ork yet at length he find mean to send to the king of England who come to his aid with forty thousand well approve and valiant englishman yet so dreadful be the monster that they stand in doubt to pass but remain thr^e day and night at saint Dennis near Paris of which the ork have no tiding hold all that time a counsel how the king of France shall be advertise of their come that joint they may assail the ork on every ^^de chap. 27 ^ how king Charles have intelligence of the king of England come 3 of their assault on both side 2 how mervin come who have conquer again all that the ork have win 4 how give charge that no man shall speak of the war before Paris 5 how a angel appear to mervin when the king of England have hold a long consult one of his train come unto he and ^ade he write his letter and in despite of all the monster in the world he will attempt to carry they to Paris which resolution the king commend and forthwith dispatch he who come to Paris about midnight and throw his letter over the wall which the next morning be find be present to the king who read they understand the courageous english king resolve wherefore he command his host to arm themselves who be then three score thousand 2 then stand in readiness they attend to hear when the onset shall be give which as soon as he hear he cry Montioy saint Denis and then ^allied forth and make the battle fearful to the pagan effect wonder to be brief both the english and french show themselves absolute for courage but the ork make such havoc of both nation that in less than a hour all the christian flee for their horatio the ork with a axe which Mutafier that night have give he kill so many that few escape but only those in the vanguard of the flight the king of England flee to saint Dennis who the ork pursue to the wall of the town then turn back to his tent he find the fair Beatrice weep who he salute and persuade to be joyful for that in six month space he will crown her queen of France but those word be worse than poison for than he she esteem hell no vile also all this while lament Charles in Paris his cross fortune because the monster now have be in France full two year and lay waste the most fruitful place in all the country 3 in this pensiveness we will leave he while to speak of the renown mervin who after he have convert all jewry go to Babylon jerusalem and the other country and bring they all back to Christianity thence he go to montment to visit drohe who he ^ound n^t and therefore sorrow most exceed vow a endless revenge if he be dead and thereupon give a assault to the town which present yield because the great part be christian so that mervin make on Samson bear in that city their governor leave he all his army and return alone into his natural kingdom of dansk where he find his fair queen and the young prince orient their son who with all the noble burgesss and commons most royal and love welcome he 4 as soon as have bring her royal lord to rest which after his weary travail of all other entertainment be to he best welcome she send private commandment to every noble man and magistrate that be likely to have access to the king that as they tender the safety of his private person and respect the public benefit of the commonwealth that they in no case shall acquaint the noble mervin with the miserable estate of the emperor Charles and the other christian in France for say she I need not tell you the resolution of my princely lord your royal king shall he but hear the least inkling thereof to France he will to woeful wretched France and if to France whither go my love lord and your life protector even to the receptacle of horror even to the grave of death where he shall combat with monster not man and not with mortal monster neither but that infernal three head dog of hell the ugly ork against who force man can have no force to make resistance o do not then I beseech you do not make i a widow and yourselves fatherless by acquaint the king with the estate of France these word she deliver with such abundance of tear that the noble and magistrate great commend her zealous care and present command on pain of death that no man shall show a heavy countenance or once whisper of the estate of France great feast and triumph be therefore make throughout and many other pastime that continue a great part of the night (@) the king be lay in his bed 5 when the hour of midnight be come there appear to he in his sleep a angel from heaven who like sunshine stand before he and say mervin the god which create all thing by i command thou that to morrow thou depart and go to king Charles and aid he against the christian who have besiege he and bring he almost to utter confusion by the mean of a monstrous three head ork against who thou must take battle and the lord will be thy defender wherefore see thou depart without any notice to the queen thy wife lest she shall follow thou which be offensive to the heaven this say the angel depart and immediate mervin arise and have arm himself and gather his soldier together tell his queen he will pass into Surrey and make a speedy return wherefore he desire she with her little son orient to pass to Lilfort where they shall not fail but meet he she glad agree because she fear no place but P^^is thus he depart with threescore thousand and make such haste that he come to Rouen which he find so sack and destroy that his heart for pity bleed within he there he leave his army and himself alone march towards Paris find every thing as he go destroy and ruinate when he be come within the sight of the pagan tent he turn himself towards they and march into the camp with his head unarm and his helmet hang by his saddle then call a pagan unto he he desire to be bring to the sight of king turniquant the pagan consent and bring he to his tent but the king be not there only he find the fair Beatrice who at the first sight know he to be a Christian and therefore demand what he seek madam say he my business be to speak with he that bear three head on his shoulder friend qd she if you will but stay here little I will go tell the king my father do so good madam say he but I beseech your ladyship stay not long chap. 28 1 how mervin undertake combat against the ork 2 of the fight and the ork death which bring rest to the christian beatrice instant go to her father and tell he what she know touch his request and how he will speak with the three head monster which the king hear he go and take the ork with he who look terrible upon mervin who no look can affright mervin stou^ly begin say thou that have dare to destroy this receptacle of christianity I challenge thou if thou dare to single combat body to body with these condition that if thou vanquish i all this country shall be at thy dispose if I shall conquer thou than thy army shall return home again if they can escape our vengeance how say thou when turniquant hear this resolute challenge he demand of he his name man call i answer he mervin which word be no soon utter but take the ork and his daughter aside he tell many wonder of mervin how he have slay barant surname the cruel with the rest of his famous conquest and therefore be now flat determine by treason to put he to death to which his daughter make answer that treason be vile even in a king and therefore rather since the ork have vaunt himself against twenty that now he shall try himself against this one single knight who there be no doubt but be will vanquish with shame or quick dispatch of his desperate life at this speech the proud ork rejoice and swear none but himself shall be in that combat so they go to mervin and accord draw certain article touch the combat which dispatch mervin go and tell Charles to who he be the welcome man alive 2 when the day of battle be come mervin Charles name joy and all their army come forth and go to the pagan tent where after their oath take on both side the two champion be bring into the list arm at all point and after the sound of trumpet they assail each other and mervin break his staff upon the ork but his armour be so good that he can not hurt he only make he recoil ten foot backward at the which the ork be angry who with his battle axe will have strike the prince but with fine nimbleness in turn he avoid it so that the axe fall into the earth above three foot than the prince with strike he a mighty blow on the head but can pierce no skin which see he sheathe his sword and take his great mace which hang by and with that give he such a blow upon one of his helmet that he reele and with much ado hold himself from fall when the ork feel these intolerable wound he fly upon mervin like a tempest and think to hit he with his devilish axe the good horse passant turn so nimble about that he fail in his purpose for why there be no steel will have bear out the blow when the ork see his effectless fury he grow mad often assail and as often fail than prince mervin advance himself give the ork such a blow on the neck that he make one of his helmet fly into the midst of the field so that one of his head be disarm then draw his sword he second his blow upon the ork disarm head that he cut away one of his ear whereat the ork raise a most fearful cry which put the pagan into a fearful affright Beatrice see this say to her father my lord this day the ork will be vanquish therefore he advise by i a^d let we fly to our ship to escape worse danger the ork be neither of our country nor kindred let we leave he to his fortune daughter say turniquant you be too blame for it he do overcome what shall befall we therefore let we attend some more of his fortune mervin this while lion-like assail the ork and give he such a monstrous wound on his thigh that he be no long able to sustain himself from fall yet still hold his axe in such sort in his hand that passant dare not assail he then begin the ork to cry so fearful that the pagan hear he truss up their tent and betake themselves to fly which the emperor Charles see show the duke naym^s say see how they fly and dare not stay the end of the battle be it not that I be swear to the contrary they shall not escape so easy it be true say name therefore let they go for the devil be their conduct as they be thus talk the pagan get to their ship and with all the haste they can sail into their own country all this while mervin assail the ork but by reason of his lie on the ground he can no whit hurt he wherefore he alight down and command passant if need compel he to come and succour he which the fairy horse well understand this say mervin go towards the ork and he see he come bethink himself of his best defence and mervin imagine to strike he the false devilish ork thrust his axe before he with such violence that hit mervin one blow upon the knee he make he perforce fall to the ground which the monster see he crawl upon he and give he many intolerable blow while mervin on the other side draw forth a poniard think to stab the monster but light upon his cuirass the dagger without hurt break in two piece then mervin implore some divine help in his succour for the ork press he most extreme yet his strength give he some remedy whereas the history report if there have be a hundred beside himself the ork have force to have strangle they all but the strength of mervin equal he every way Charles see this turmoil weep exceed and say to name what shall we do sith the damn ork hold king mervin in subjection as they be thus in talk passant see his lord in danger he go to this ork and take hold of his disarm head in such sort that in despite of his will he make he let king mervin go who instant rise take his sword which lie on the ground passant with his tooth take hold of his ear and mervin give he two such blow that he let his battle axe fall then double his blow he cut off his other two head at who death Mutafier come in such a tempest that all Paris tremble then see his son dead he will have take vengeance but of the horse he can not because he be a fairy and of the ma^ster he dare not because he have hear divine prayer before the combat otherwise he have do some notable mischief but prevent he can do nothing but take his son and all his accompliment into hell with he yet know for a surety that at his departure he make such a wonderful storm that for the space of a quarter of a hour the dark midnight have a fair countenance chap. 29 1 how mervin take leave of Charles and depart 2 how he go to jerusalem and thence be convey into Fairia thus do the false ork that monstrous son of the devil come to his end be slay in the thir^^eth month of his age be so invincible that he bring all France almost desolate and so likewise have do all Christendom if God have not raise mervin to be his destroyer and the story say that if mervin have be bring up with woman milk he can never have conquer the monster now by this time come Charles and the other christian who with great honour and solemnity will have bring he to the city but he refuse tell the emperor he must first pay his vow to the sepulchre of his saviour entreat Charles for his sake to aid his son orient when any extremity shall assail he which when Charles hear he sorrow exceed 2 thus part mervin who Charles will no long hold and come to Rouen where his army attend he who he send to Lilfort and bid they charge his queen ^o look careful to his son orient for that he will go to jerusalem thus ^^parted they and he stay still in Rouen till the wound in his knee be cure then he betake himself to the sea which have overpass he ride till he come to a forest where the night so sudden overtake he that he know not where to lodge now it fall out that Mutafier to revenge his son death make in this wood a abbacy and himself like a nun when mervin espy the house he spur his horse towards it but by no mean can he make he go but evermore he do recoil back then come Mutafier in the habit of a nun and salute he then mervin desire she to take his horse and bring he to the house than which the devil desire nothing more so soon as mervin be within the hall he find a table spread and store of cake but mervin will neither eat nor drink but Mutafier at last enchant he that he forget God and fall to both eat and drink which when Mutafier perceive he vow at midnight to carry he to hell then he demand of mervin if h^e will go to his rest to which he consent bring he into a most sumptuous chamber where when he be lay to repose before the night be half spend he imagine that the chamber the abbey the bed and all about he be on fire wherefore incontinent he arise and arm himself and come into the court where he find Mutafier in the likeness of passant who then be go into Fairia upon who as soon as he be mount the devil fly away like thunder or tempest and bear he by wood river and mountain even to hell where he find his travel double for by the commandment of God the devil be compel to bear he back again wherefore he carry he into India where be many serpent and cruel beast and therefore discharge himself of his b^rthen he tell mervin how he be his mortal enemy the spirit Mutafier that have the keep of he at Minor and there so many year forment he with hideous noise tell he that he intend to have bear he quick into hell and that now he will be revenge for the fatal death of his dear belove son ork which mervin hear he draw his sword and defend himself therewith in such sort that if the malicious flend Mutafier have be mortal he have slay he a hundred time which see mervin with the sign of the cross bless himself at which the devil like a tempest fly away and leave mervin who fall on his knee ask pardon of his creator than he behold his horse passant to who he go but in that the devil have deceive he he be strict in trust wherefore use some blessing and conjuration passant fall upon his knee and then he
