THE COVRSE OF CONFORMITIE as it hath proceeded.

Archippus.
I Begin no sooner to think upon the progresse of my short time in the Ministerie, but I remember of the Students of Athens, who the first yeare were wisemen, the second yeare Philosophers, onely lovers of wisedome; the next year Rhetoricians, no better then babblers; and the last yeare Idiots. At the first I seemed somewhat to others, and more then somewhat to my selfe; like many in these times, at whose blind boldnesse, out of mine own experience, I would smile, were it not a subject of compassion. But afterward the Lord in his great mercie, opening my eyes to see, and touching my heart to blush at my owne insufficiencie and naughtinesse, I began to denie my selfe, to unsecret my soule to you: and at the first poured out all my former phantasies and present thoughts into your bosome. At which time my reverend Epaphras, I received happie information, in some measure to be that indeed, which I was before in appearance; and manie times since haue I beene with great delight, exercised with you in heavenly contemplations for the furtherance of Gods work: But now my harp, with Iobs, is turned to mourning, and my Organ into the voice of the^ that weep. Through the iniquitie of the present Polemicall times. I am led aside to Controversies, which are not in the high way to heaven wherin we were walking before: All my former delight is cha^ged into an earnest desire to bee throughly informed concerning the division which hath happened in this our mother Kirk, so renoumed in the Christian world for perfect reformation, through the late alterations wrought at the last Parliament holden at Edinburgh in August, 1621, for the ratification of the fiue now famous Articles of Perth Assemblie; Since which time the whole quarters of this Kingdome hath been universally filled with dinn and diversitie of motions and

speeches. Some like Haman when the letters of revenge were published against Mordecai and his people; some like the Israelites when they sate down to eat and drink and rose up to play; Others like the Iewes themselues when they were in perplexitie and great sorrow: The fourth sort equalling the first in miserie of scene-serving sycophants, who finding the religion before them, and not within them, are readie to serue God or the divel, as the companie will.Three things demanded con ern ng conformitie And finally some so petted and empacque, that they suspend both their judgement and practise, till they see which side shall prevaile. As therefore I never went from your societie but either wiser or better, so must I now in my great need, importune you for my comfort and quietnesse of my minde, to giue me some satisfaction in these three particulars, all linked in one chaine. First, out of your old experience; what hath been the methode of this mysterie of iniquitie from our reformation to this time. Secondly, out of your diligent observation, by what meanes, and after what manner past it in an Act in the late Parliament. Thirdly, after conclusion past in Kirk and Parliament, out of your graue direction, what is to be done of us, especially in the case of mans immediate opposition, of the Necessitie of Conformitie or Deprivation: Promising for dutie to follow after you in the straitest waies of passiue obedience, so farre as I finde truth going before you, and leaving the successe with cheerefulnesse, to his high providence, who makes all things work together for good to them that loue him.


Epaphras.
And no sooner think I upon my long course in the holy Ministerie, begun about the flourishing times of our first temple, but with incredible joy of heart I call to mind the goodnesse of my God, where with in a time of so great defection, I haue escaped the danger of the proverbiall speech of the Hebrews, first uttered of Balaam, who seeking preferment lost the gift of Prophecie;Camelus coruna quaerens aures amisis. Drus. The Camel seeking bornes, lost his eares. Had my care beene to haue lift up my horne on high, my gift of Prophecie in publick, and grace of giving good counsell in private, had long since perished: And so by this time I am sure (whatsoever is become of others, vvhom I judge not) I had been troad on as unsavorie salt; a burden to my selfe, and unprofitable to you, and all others of your disposition, who for your invinceable courage are worthie of the oracle of Counsell.Il ne perd rien qui ne perd Dieu. And therefore albeit my mediocritie cannot promise full satisfaction, because your demand requires a deep knowledge of things past, present and to come; with the height of the highest spirit, not onely prepared to break the neck of his present fortune, but also overlooking all casualties; and equally armed for all events: And in a word a man that knows

much of the world and cares little for it: Yet because all that I haue I owe to God and his people, by his grace in whom I am preserved, and who is able to keep me that I fall not, I shall assay what I can, with this premonition, that in case the historicall part of my answer, concerning things past and present, shall happen to halt in some places, and to walk upon one foot,^r^p achepte le miel qui sur espines le leche. not daring to set down the other in the midst of so many thornie purposes, wherein all the veritie would not, may not be heard; let a vvord now and then, albeit covertly uttered, be enough to your vvise eare: And let it bee my imputation that, of the twofold commendation of a good historie, No trueth unspoken,Nihil Verum non, nihil non Verum. no untreuth spoken, Charitie hath made me to bee content with the latter till I come to the third point vvhere I shall set down both my feet, and vvithout danger of so great offence walk with greater libertie.


Archipp.
Your mind I perceiue malices no man,(...). A threefold consideration for satisfying of the first Demand. and your meaning according to your fashion of conference, vvhich was ever more materiall then personall, is rather tovvard then to giue a blow. My desire also (albeit an hieroglyphicall historie be halfe dumb) is not so much after men as matter; persons as purposes: let me onely know by things past from whence vve are come, and by things presently done and in doing, where we now are, that my course in time to come may be the more sate and sound.


Epaph.
All prefaces are song to the greedie hearer. To beginne then vvith your first Demand, the length thereof reaching from the first reformation through manifold alterations to the last Parliament, shall be abridged to a threefold consideration: First, vvhat Christ did for us in the beginning of his undeserved loue: secondly, vvhat Antichrist did against us in his unquenchable malice; and thirdly, vvhat the true members of the Kirk did in their sincerity and faithfulnesse.


Archipp.
That project punctually pursued, vvill delight any true Scots heart to heare, and vvill giue eye to me borne out of time to see, as that I had lived then, that vvhich I both feare and loue to knovv: first then, vvhat vvas that incomparable loue vouchsafed on us.


Epaph.
Our Saviour Christ did plant a vineyard in this land, as in a verie fruitfull hill, he hedged it,The first consideration. and gathered out the stones of it, and planted it vvith the best plants, he built a tovver in the midst of it, and also made a vvine-presse therein, and after manie yeares, and divers troubles and travells (according to the truth uttered by a deere servant of God vvhen the gospell first began to shine among us) the realme vvas illuminated vvith the light of Christs Evangell as clearely as ever vvas any realme since

the daies of the Apostles: The house of God was builded in it; yea, it did not lacke (whatsoever the enemie imagine in the contrarie) the verie coapstone: the jurisdiction and libertie of the true Kirk, Generall and Provinciall Assemblies, Presbyteries, Sessions and Discipline were brought to their perfection: all lawes of idolatrie abrogate; all presentations of Benefices directed to the particular Presbyteries, with power to put order to all matters Ecclesiasticall within their bounds,Hic fuit vnit^s sine schismate, ventas sine haeresi and bonitas absque hypocrisi. according to the discipline of the Kirk. But all this faire and flourishing estate is tyed to it own condition of contrary change; if the people shall be after unthankfull, then fearefull and terrible shall the plagues be.


Archipp.
That truth of the man of God, I must confesse, meeteth us this day in our face, for as the loue hath been great, the people haue proved unthankfull, and the plagues are alreadie begun: The Lord looked for grapes, and behold nothing but wilde grapes; why should he not then lay his vineyard wast, and command the clouds that they raine no more raine upon it: But what secret would you haue me to consider upon the Antichrist his side.


Epaph.
Antichrist inflamed with the furious zeale of his cursed Kingdome, and enraged by his inveterate malice against our profession,Secondly what Antichrist did. as a burning light to discover his damnable darkenesse, never ceased to resist the grace of God among us, to his uttermost possibilitie: sending forth, as he might command, the armies of crueltie, his wilde Boares and roaring Lyons, with open mouth and readie pawes to threaten and proclaime their enmitie, as in that bloudie enterprise of the 88, when God shewing his might, no lesse against these mortall enimies, then for the Kirks and Kingdomes of this Iland, redeemed his own people mightily from the teeth of the Dog; and ruined these Vnicornes as mightily in his wrath: But that marvellous overthrow from the heaven aboue, and the waters beneath, conspiring to represse the pride of that tyrant, did no wise moue him to forsake his bloudie purpose, but within few daies thereafter, assaying to practise by craft which hee could not performe by open crueltie, like a sworne enemie to the oath of Alleageance, he treacherously inchanted, and miserably perverted diverse of this Kingdome to negotiate with him and his Emissaries, Iesuites and seminarie Priests, for subversion of this whole state. You may reade and remember the execution of ^entrie, the Bridge of Dee, and the unnaturall and treacherous attempt of the 93, etc.


Archipp.
You seeme to me if you would follow forth that discourse in speaking of the times past to point at the present; and to taxe the treacherie of living men in their persons who are long

since dead But I rest content for the present with your pointing at that Spanish spring from whence the streames haue been comming northward this time by past which now overflow this Kirk and Iland: and desires to know what was done at that time for resisting of Antichrist.


Epaph.
The watchmen of the Lords house and sincere professors as they were directed and assisted by grace,Thirdly, how Antichrist was resisted. resisted the violence of open enemies, and diligently searched the hid wickednes of lurking vipers, intending to sting to the death, and after tryall taken of the venomous heads of those Romish monsters, who spared not to adventure themselues, their friends and whole estate in that foule and unnaturall trick, they proceeded against them, and put them under the highest censure Ecclesiasticall, and therupon procured their deserved forefalture.


Archip.
Those Satanicall supposts of that Italian Priest and Indian Pluto deserved no lesse: And now it seemeth that the Kirk and the Country are well purged of such Antichristian and disnatured spirit.


Epaph.
Had the successe been answerable to the censure, the fire had been quenched, and we quit of them and their adulterous generation multiplying in midst of us to this day: But the general Assembly holden at Edinburgh 1594 declareth the contrarie in these words of Inscription. The dangers which through the impunitie of the exco^municate Papists trafiquers with the Spaniards and other enemies of the Religion and estate, are imminent to the true Religion professed within this Kingdom, his Majesties person, crown and libertie of this our natiue Countrie. And at more length in Eleven Articles, of which number the first is: It is certaine, that the Spaniard who with so great preparations in the 88, did interprise the conquest of this Ile, remaines as yet of that same intention, and waites onely upon a meet occasion to accomplish that his devilish purpose, as cleerely appeares in his continuing in this intertainment of intelligence and traffiquing with the foresaid excommunicates ever since the dissipation of his Navie. And the last: whereas his Majestie and Estates at the first discoverie of their conspiracies apprehended a verie great danger to true Religion, the Kings estate and crown, and libertie of the Countrie; and notwithstanding that the same cause of danger as yet remaines whole unremoved, their is no apprehension of any danger, nor earnest care to withstand it, it is evident that their is an inclination and purpose to cover, extentiate and bear forth the evil cause, wherthrough they will not see: or else the Lord in judgement hath blinded and hardned the hearts of all estates to grop in the mid day at that which they ca^not see, which is the greatest danger of al, and a most certain argument of the wrath of God, and his heavie judgement hanging over the land, and so much the more to be feared, because there is no cause of fear apprehended.
Archip. But what could either the civill or spirituall sword doe more for the good of the kirk and countrey against their vnnaturall malice.


Epaph.
When you tempt me after that sort, ye forget my protestation in the beginning: I will onely shew what the kirk (now holding the wolfe by the eares) resolved to doe, out of the apprehension of so great danger for preventing of ensuing evils, and for purging the realme from open offences ready to draw on higher wrath; They begin carefully to mark the corruptions of every state and calling, earnestly recommending to all vnfaigned and timous repentance: and for that effect publick humiliations were kept, a covenant renewed with God first in the generall Assembly holden at Edinburgh the penult of March 1595, and thereafter in the Provinciall Assemblies, Presbyteries, and Sessions for stirring up and moving all more carefully to cleaue to their comfortable profession. In great plainnesse and zeale sounded the Pulpits against papistry and their resetters. The Assemblies of the kirk were frequentlie kept, delinquents without respect of persons admonished and censured, Residence of Ministers earnestly vrged, and all men and meanes, as they had grace and place, were set a-work for reformation of abuses, and defence of the kirk against her bloudy enemies.


Archip.
The holy courage of the ministerie, and spirituall happinesse of the kirk in that time, puts me in mind of that which is in the Canticle, Thou art beautifull, O my loue, as Ti^za, comely as Ierusalem, terrible as an army with banners.


Epaph.
But while the faithfull servants of God were thus set to cure the wound lately received, and to prosecute the reformation of corruptions; the persons standing under both civill and ecclesiasticall censure of the unnaturall crimes afore named, without shame or feare, yea in great boldnes, durst presume to shew themselves openly within the countrey.


Archip.
What could be done in that case of so proud contempt and manifest danger.


Epaph
The messengers of God were set with fresh courage, as became their holy calling and vigilant care to provide new remedies for that so deadly maladie. But as they assayed to cure that disease, a more dangerous sore brake out. A woefull question was moved about the marches of the kirkes Iurisdiction, and certain ministers were pursued before civil Iudges for matters of doctrine. By those and other unhappy occasions, were the ministers of God taken off the pursute of the enemies of religion, and intended course for reforming corruptions, and constrained to bestow their thoughts and endevours in defence of themselves, and libertie of

the Kirk; but with what successe the event will declare.


Archip.
That policie hath at all times proved pernitious to the Kirk, and advantagious to the enemie. But my ignorance makes me to marvell more how the kirk having authoritie for her, could be forced to take her to the defenders part: And therefore I pray you make this part somewhat plaine.


Epaph.
Machiavell will never be plain to a prentise in his craft, albeit he were a maister in other Arts. In those dayes there fell out a discontentment amongst Statesmen: the Octavians and the Chalmermen went in factions, according to the customes of such times. The kirk then being somewhat, and the credit thereof not a little respected, what could curry favour was suggested to chiefe ministers in such measure, and by one of them so apprehended for extremitie and present danger, as he was then in a high place of the ministerie, and now as high in credit but in a new mould, was not affraied in great boldnes to affirme in a place of chiefe respect, as he repeated himselfe in a publick conference concerning the difficulties then in hand, That the Kirk gat but faire promises, and words without effect, and the enemies gat the deeds. It were but sorrow to remember, and pittifull to repeat the lamentable broyles of October, November, and December of the yeare 1596, each one following another like the heads of Hydra stricken off, or the abhominations of Ezechiels Temple, after the sight of some, stil moe. By these vnexpected hurly-burlies, the vnitie of the faithfull and carefull concurrence for offices due to the necessities of religion, was strangely shaken; and they by proclamations, the terrible trumpets of authoritie, scattered like the ships of Tarshis. Vpon this untimous distemper of a body whole in appearance, and well compacted to the eye, but secretly racked in some principall members, wittie wickednes quickly began to lay the foundation of a cursed Babell, and first to divide Hippocrates twins, and then to charge the kirk with sedition, insurrection, as Archenemie of common peace, and likely to disquiet all rankes and persons, as indeed the remedies against enemies of the truth, and reformation of notorious corruptions, if they had been prosecuted, as honestie required, and without respect of mens persons, would have made some sort of sturre amongst the maisters of strange plots. But in few dayes the kirk lost the smiling surmises of those discontented or rather dissembled factions. These cunning controversies were quickly composed, and they set aworke to compasse the way of peace for the excommunicats, as did appeare at Fackland and Dumfermeline: and thereafter in the processe of their relaxation, and many favours secretly insinuated, and openly showen in the forme thereof, and before and after the same, not onely by civill m^n,

but also by some provinciall assemblies, and sundry ministers. In this vncouth rite and mysticall form of dealing, the mouth of the Canon was turned from Babylon the mother citie of force and falshood, desperately set to snare the world to her subjection, and the generation of the wise found it was high time, every man inviting another, Come, let vs worke wisely with the kirk, least that they increase and we decrease: for at that time Ierusalem was a strong citie: her Motto then was, Vnitie strengthens the cause, her wall was discipline and her assemblies, her sword the sword of the spirit, plaine pertinent and powerfull doctrine: her glory, the favour of God, manifested in her manifold deliverances, florishing estate and still triumphing over her enemies; Then did she constantly hold that such was the crueltie of Rome, that she is the second beast thirsting for the Saints bloud.Pax cum hareticis este non potest, bellum (...). Catholici non patiuntur in suo grege ullos qui oftendunt ullo signo externo so fauere Lutheranis Bell. de Laicis l. 3. c. 19. Vpon their side, As many as wil not worship the image of the beast, shall be killed. The firie Fathers of Trent, All Lutherans, Calvinists, and such as are of the new religion, shall vtterly be rooted out. Bellarmine the oracle of Rome: The Catholickes suffer none in their societie that by any outward signe giue evidence of their favour to Lutherans. And upon our part, it should be a great height of vnthankfulnesse in us freed from the Romane bondage, not to stand out against the present kirk of Rome, but to yeeld ourselves to plots of Reconciliation, so long as they cry. What care we for the same creed? No peace with Rome. etc.


Archip.
That Italizing craft of Scottish windings, and secret underminings, brings me out of the element of my simplicitie, into an vncouth world of policie, and remembers me of the comparison of Epiphanius, likening an hereticke to a modiwort or brok, working hid under the ground, and making the earth aboue her to swell and to moue: yet I see not how these earthly moles can shake a citie builded upon a rock.


Epaph.
To this time the kirk notwithstanding all oppositions externall and intestine, did stand whole and sound in the vnitie of her ministers, authoritie of her assemblies, order of her ministery, and puritie of divine worship. But there was the beginning of her calamitie. The enemies being frustrated in the yeare 88. and not finding after that time how they shall (like Caligula) cut the throat of the whole Kirk and religion at one stroke, they resolue to be still working the maine conclusion by degrees, and to maime her of her members, that in the meane time the Kirk may be still decreasing in beautie and strength, the ministery may be more exercised in their owne defence men in their pursute. At last they or their posteritie may bring the purpose to an end. And it may be, that by some intervening occasion, the work may be made short. Working and waiting will doe the turn in the end.
Archip. God hath not plagued us finally with that occasion as we haue deserved, and they desire.Defection of the kirk in foure essential degrees. But we may all see division in the kirk for Vnitie, for Iurisdiction and authoritie vsurpation and tyrannie, for order Episcopacie, and for the puritie and power of worship, polluted and perfunctorious service. Albeit I cannot for my selfe marvell enough upon what side of a citie so compact in it selfe they could make the first assault, and desire to know if, as I perceiue now, that the weed hath growen so in former times, ye did see it to be growing, and by what meanes.


Epaph.
Know yee not the maxime, Divide and overcome:The first degree, Division for Vnitie. The kirk at that time was so respected for a strong estate, that scarcely durst any without helpe from her owne hand, enterprise her hurt; and therefore her enemies dealt with her Cassander like friends to divide the Ministerie: And for this end a quarrell was professed against the great libertie vsed in application of the doctrine. Item, against divers poynts of discipline: and for remedie of that pretended disease, there was offered to the ministers a bond restraining the power of their office in doctrine, application thereof, and in discipline. And divers ministers vvere called and accused (as multitudes yet living may vvell remember) but that band vvas modestly and happily refused vpon reasons unanswerable for the time, and no cause found in the ministers sufficiently to ground the change intended.


Archip
When that course failed vvhat vvas next assayed?Begun at Perth.


Epaph.
With a better lustre there were penned and printed 55 questions, to be resolved by the estates and generall assembly to be holden at Perth the last Febr. 1596. And vvhat paines vvas taken there by some of a farre other minde now both to direct the ministers in their studies and sermons, and to repell these questions by strong and well prepared answers, their old papers, and their old conscience vvill best record in time and place, as the judge of the world shall think meet.


Archip.
I would vnderstand something of the keeping and proceedings of that meeting.


Epaph.
Vpon the day appointed at the same Borough, a great number of ministers from all the Presbyteries of this realme (but specially from Aberdene, Murray and Angus) as they vvere required by his Maiesties missiue, did convene, and some two dayes after came a number of the Nobilitie. In that meeting the ministers being as yet all of one minde, refused a mixture of the Nobilitie and Ministerie to make up an Ecclesiasticall or rather confused meeting. But after some dayes spent in secret conference betwixt some Civilians and some of the chiefe Ministers, a course was taken for opening the dore to Division, that shee might as should

be thought meet, weaken vnitie, and make way to the proiects in hand.


Archip.
In vvhat particulars vvere the ministers divided at that meeting?


Epaph.
In these four especially: first, an^nt the nature of the meeting, some holding that all generall assemblies vvere either ordinary, or Pro re nata consisting of commissioners authorized with commission, and directed from Provinciall assemblies or presbyteries to meet in a certain time and place appointed by the kirk with his Maiesties consent, and having Moderator and Clark according to the institution and custome of the said meeting, vvhich were no vvaves here to be found: Others holding, that in respect of the missiue it vvas lawfull, vvhich alleageance vvas so farre granted as it concerned the libertie of the persons met; but denied to bee a sufficient vvarrant for them to performe the duties proper for a generall assembly. But in the end, it vvas born away vvith strong hand, that it should be called an extraordinary generall assembly. Secondly, about cerain answers given more liberally then advisedly to these 13 articles proponed to that meeting, as a favourable ease of the 55 questions, vvhich of reason should have been seen and considered at length in inferiour assemblies before they had been concluded to be the ground work of such a strange building as now is raised upon the^. Thirdly, an ample co^mission granted in favour of the excommunicats, from the ministery there met, to certain of their own number, as inclined to accept, as they vvere prone to give, notwithstanding of the troublesome condition of that time, and informality of that conuention. And lastly for presuming to alter the order of calling the roll, and marking the votes usually observed all times before.


Archip.
By vvhat means could so many vvorthy and vvise men be separat from their brethren, and depart from their own stedfastnes.


Epaph.
The meanes are best known to themselues, bodie seminatum est venenum aspidum in Ecclesia Dei. I may say of them that vvhich was sayd of flattering Gregorius in the beginning of the Roman Hierarchy. That they vvere the vvorst amongst the best, and the best amongst the worst. That the schisme by vvhich many now are called Schismatickes, began at this time on their side: and that they carried away the ignominious victory not by their own valor, but by the modesty of their brethren, and over great reverence tovvards them for their courage and good cariage in former times.


Archip.
And perhaps it vvould trouble their vvits now to answer speeches and arguments used and vttered by themselues then, no lesse then it would haue busied the braine of the same Gregorius raised from the dead to answer his own argument in the dayes of

Bonifacius the third, Whosoever will be called vniversall Bishop, is the fore-runner of Antichrist. etc.


Epaph.
Yet Bellarmine hath found out two shifts for Bonifacius, and they twentie for themselues. But being baited on this beginning, they not onely grew want on themselves, and ran away vvith the harrowes, but wrought upon others by terrors and promises as they thought to prevaile; and the course once inclining to the dounwith and growing calme, men fell away by heaps: the sweet name of peace being made a visor to cover the ugly face of a strange monster.


Archip.
The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water, Prov. 17.14. And you seeme to have sayd that our present inundations did begin at that breach.


Epaph.
It was so indeed:1 May 1597. Continued and increasing at Dundie. for in the next assembly holden at Dundie the water becomes broader, and the schisme begun at Perth, groweth greater: 1. by difference of judgement anent the confirmation of the former assembly holden at Perth: 2. by diversitie of opinions concerning the setting down of some notes in forme of declaration of certaine of the acts concluded at Perth, explaining his Maiesties and the assemblies meaning for the satisfaction of such as then vvere not acquainted therewith, and now to be registred in this assembly at Dundie, to remaine, etc. but like the glosse of Orleans: 3. by indulgence, for duetie, directed in a new commission carying greater favour to the excommunicats and their vassals, their insinuating care of the dangers of the Kirk imminent from a higher cause: 4. from a new forme of commission drawing power from the generall assembly to a few number of persons, and aiming them for execution of some of the dangerous articles rashly yeelded to, as did appeare in diverse attempts. Lastly, about excommunication and other points of Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction. And againe the spait of division swelleth to a great height, the flouds encrease and prevaile in the assembly holden at Dundie the 7 of March 1597, 1. by certaine greeves put in Articles by brethren of divers quarters of the countrey; and given in against the the proceedings of the commissioners anent alterations made at Edinburgh and Santandros and forme of casting out and putting in ministers: the vvhich greeves behoved to be buried, otherwise no peace for the Kirke. 2. for the commissioners presumption taking upon them vvithout expresse and particular warrant from the Kirk to treat with the parliament holden at Edinburgh the 19 of December 1597. anent the Kirkes vote in parliament, she standing as yet in doubt if it should be thought leesome that the ministers should succeed in the prelates places for voting in Parliament. 3. About the diversitie of Iudgement anent the

conditions of the sayd vote, some holding that the Kirk should be declared the third estate of parliament, and authorized with all lawfull priviledges, and having libertie as Barons and Burgesses have, to choose their own commissioners, others ready to take the same in what sort and vpon vvhat conditions it might bee had. 4. About that woefull commission continued and enlarged vvith a seeming, but sore clause for keeping the Ministers free of offences.


Archip.
Your vvaters are like to grow to a sea vvherin the course of navigation looseth the sight of the one pole, and entreth in some degrees of elevation of the other. Beware of shipwrack of religion in the end.


Epaph.
The truth is, the division prevailing at Dundie, becommeth a great sea at Montrose,Preuailing at Montrose and bringeth in that Trojan horse so pleasantly palliat vvith a faire mantle of fine caveats, and even then greedily gaped for by some, foresmelling their own wealth and honour in that Ecclesiasticall Tragedie, but constantly refused by others foreseeing and fearing more sorrow to the Kirk in the conditions annexed, then apprehending good in a seeming benefit so violently offred. In that generall assembly the 18 day of March 1600, after many combats and braulings about the cautions restraining the commissioners voters in Parliament from corruption frowardly, as it might be, the caveats, the lurking deceit of hierarchie vvere finally set downe.


Archip.
These palliative caveats are in form and effect much like the professions set out by Foegadius and Servatio, to save the Kirk as they imagined from Arrian perfidie, but in event a furtherance to their blasphemous haeresie and cruell victorie. It vvere better to hold theeves at the doore, then wait upon them in the house that they steale not. I vvould know before I proceed, vvhat miseries followed upon this unhappy division and alteration made in these foure assemblies begun at Dundie, and concluded at Montrose.


Epaph.
Evils ensuing upon the former division.The tongue and pen of another Nizianzene vvere not sufficient to deplore and expresse them to the full. In the generall assembly holden at Bruntyland the next yeare 1601 May 12. and at Halyrood-house the yeare following 1602, November 10. these are pointed at: Defection from the puritie, zeale and practise of true religion proceeding from the just vvrath of God for dishonouring of our profession, the negligence of the Ministers against Papists, the desolation of divers parts of the countrey for lack of Pastors, the neglecting of places of chiefest importance to the interest of religion, in not planting them vvith sufficient Pastors: the ouer-hasty admission of men to the ministerie

before their sufficiencie be knowne: the negligence of Ministers in reading the Scriptures, and controversies betwixt the reformed Kirk and enemies thereof: the uncomely carriage of Ministers framing themselves excessiuely to the humors of men in communications, intemperance, and light apparrell, the distraction vvhich is supposed to bee from some of the ministerie, and of themselves from themselves, the desolation of the Kirke of Edinburgh, the great favour showne to Papists, and their great credit by that meanes, in negligent education of noble mens children, the impunitie of Saylers transporting and bringing within the countrey Seminarie Priests and Iesuits vvith their coffers and books, that men suspect in religion when they are chalenged, haue accesse to court during the time of their processe. That the late reconciled Papists are not urged to performe the conditions agreed to at their reconciliation to the Kirke; All vvhich were either caused or occasioned by the former division.


Epaph.
It had been high time vpon these evident dangers and pittifull cryes of the Kirk, to haue repented of the former division, and to haue returned to their brotherly vnitie and Philadelphian profession, Nec enim vllum maius concordiae vinculum quam timor externus.


Epaph.
Multi clerici sunt progenies viperarum, Policie did foresee that that happy course vvould not satisfie the burning lust of Hierarchie:Second degree of defection, for Iurisdiction usurpation. and therefore they are so farre from once looking back to brotherly agreement upon equall conditions, that esteeming the fire of division to be the most naturall element for their purpose, they add fresh oyle by labouring to abolish the Iurisdiction of the Kirk, and giving a dead stroake to her chiefe priviledge of holding of generall Assemblies ordinarily once in the yeare, and after pro re nata, which is the second essentiall degree of our defection.


Archip.
I haue seen the rent of vnitie, I beseech you to bee as plaine in this poynt, that I may be informed upon what occasion and by what meanes the Kirk was deprived of that awfull power and faire libertie.


Epaph.
According to the order usually observed,Assemby at Aberdine. the Assembly at Halyrood house 1602 appointed the next generall Assembly to bee holden at Aberdene in the yeare 1604 by reason 1 of the insolencie of Papists in the North countrey, 2 a purpose to plant Noblemens houses and chiefe places with sufficient ministers, 3 to prosecute the remedies of defection remembred in the assembly at Bruntyland, 4th at the late reconciled Papists might be urged to performe the conditions agreed to by them.

Lastly, to follow out the common affaires of the Kirk. Notwithstanding these and other intervenient causes that dyet was not kept, but the Assembly continued once and to be continued again: Wherupon the Provinciall Assemblies and Presbyteries considering that the Parliament was approching for which Articles were to be dressed in the Assemblie, according to the order continually obserued since the reformation, that the people were begun to delude the censures of inferiour Assemblies by appellation to the generall, that all the forenamed evils were daily growing greater; and thinking upon the necessitie of that rare benefite so deerly bought, and fearing the losse thereof so many waies apparant, as 1 by abridgement, or deprivation of wonted libertie to convene: 2 by division of the members therof, begun at Perth, and now come to so great height: 3 by terrours and strange imputations against their Ministers, their meetings and assisters: 4 by often changing of appointed dyets, and at some times bringing the Assemblie within the pallace: 5 by a cunning, but woefull commission drawing from the wisest counsell of the Kirk, to certaine Ministers, the credit and guiding of the greatest affaires: 6 by continuations multiplyed as prejudiciall to the Kirk, as Papistrie, profannesse, and other corru^^^^ns did se^sibly increase, conforme to the order and custome of the Kirk ratified by the lawes of the countrie; they directed their commissioners to meet at Aberdeen the 2 of Iuly 1605 for holding the Generall Assemblie, as was formerly appointed: of these commissioners a certaine number kept and the rest were absent, and so nothing was done but Call and Continue for safetie of the priviledge, by appointing a new Diet, a silly Seminarie, but of many and grievous troubles: the men were first called, and for a long time put in prison, therafter proceeded against by course of law, found guiltie of high treason, returned to their severall prisons, and therafter banished. Since that Assemblie we haue had the name of Generall Assemblies, but no more, according to the maine maxime of policie, that the name bee as little changed as may bee, though the thing bee changed.


Archipp.
Third degree for order Episcopacie, advanced by 6 steps. First step of Prelacie vote in Parliament.When unitie and authoritie are now gone, I marvell not that Hierarchie comes the greater speed. But I would know the rest of the waies of that Ambition, and therein see the third step of our defection: For as yet I see it riseth upon the ruines of the Kirk, and proues like the melt in the bodie, as it swelleth and waxeth great the strength and beautie of the bodie decayeth.


Epaph.
Neither was this Rome builded the first day: The first great step of their blind-winding staires, whereupon they are lifted by all the former engines and preparations was, their vote in

Parliament. For upon the former calamities, as wishes before the wind of their great prosperitie, a Parliament was appointed and kept at Perth the first of Iuly 1606, where they having croppen into Bishoprickes, vvithout respect to Calling, Commission or Caveat, were horsed upon the highest honours of their Episcopall dignitie. At that beginning they looked somewhat modestly as new come from the schoole of old ministeriall paritie, and as novices in their new world, would haue been glad of the countenance of their old acquaintance: but since that they haue learned to walk in state and soft rayment, as little respecting the greatest seculars as they were regarded of all honest men before: but gay clothes and great places will make Monkies to seem Monsicures, and forgetfull fooles to say, this cannot be I. At that berrie mercat of Kirk livings by that common interchange where havocke beares sway, Take thou this, and I that: for the purchase of thirteen dilapidate Bishoprickes forth of the hands of civill men, to the use of civilized Ministers, the Kirk did loose the greatest part of her rent destinate for the service of the Gospell, and ad pios usus. And without all feare to follow such sacriledge, Restitutio ad integrum was deerly bought what by erections of Ecclesiasticall rents in temporall Lordships, and eversions of Kirk priviledges by Hierarchicall domination.


Archipp.
It had been easie to bring them down again from that first step; neither at any time before or since could the opportunitie be greater: before, the working was secret under the ground, and denyed; now the monsters of ambition and avarice set out their heads, aftervvards they became stronger. A shame that the watchmen are now all fast asleep, that all the friends of the Kirk haue dealt treacherously vvith her. A pitie that there be none to speak a word in season for her against her enemies.


Epaph.
Soft I pray you, be not so passionate, breath a little, there was no neglect of dutie; for the ministers of the Gospell having commission from their Provinciall Assemblies and Presbyteries to convene there for the vveale of the Kirk, apprehending her hurt, and having neither place nor povver to resist did solemnly and humbly protest in the manner and vvords follovving.
The earnest desire of our hearts is to be faithfull,Protestation against vote in Parliament. and in case we could haue been silent and faithfull at this time, when the undermined estate of Christs Kirk craues a duetie at our hands; wee should haue locked up our hearts with patience, and our mouthes with taciturnitie, rather then to haue impeached any with our admonition: But that which Christ commandeth, necessitie urgeth; and duetie wringeth out of us to be faithfull Office-bearers in the Kirk of God, no man can justly blame us to doe it; providing we hold our selfe within the bounds of that Christian moderation

which followeth God, without injurie done to any man, specially those whom God hath lipped up within the skirts of his owne honorable stiles and names, calling them Gods upon earth: Now therefore (my Lords convened in this present Parliament, under the most high and excellent Majestie of our dread Soveraigne) to your Honours is our exhortation, that yee would indevour with all singlenesse of heart, loue and zeale, to advance the building of the house of God: reserving alwayes into the Lord his owne hands that glorie which be will communicate neither with man nor Angell, to wit, to prescribe from his holy mountaine a liuely patterne according to which his own Tabernacle should be formed: remembring alwaies that there is no absolute and unbounded authoritie in this world, except the soveraigne authoritie of Christ the King, to whom it belongeth as properly to rule the Kirk, according to the good pleasure of his own will, as it belongeth to him to saue his Kirk by the merit of his own sufferings. All other authoritie is so intrenched within the marches of divine commandement,Heb 12, 25 28.29. that the least overpassing of the bounds set by God himselfe, bringeth men under the fearefull expectation of temporall and eternall judgements. For this cause, my Lords, let that authoritie of your meeting in this present Parliament, be like the Ocean sea, which as it is greatest of all other waters, so it conteyneth it selfe better within the coasts and limits appointed by God, then any river of fresh running waters haue done. Next remember that God hath set you to be Nourish Fathers of his Kirk,(...). 49.23. craving at your binds that yee should maintaine and advance by your authoritie that Kirk which the Lord hath fashioned by the uncounterfaited work of his own new creation (as the Prophet speak th) he hath made us,Psa. 100.1 and not we our our selues, but not that she should presume to fashion and shape a new portrature of a Kirke, and a new forme of divine service which God in his world hath not before allowed, because that were to extend your authoritie farther then the calling yee haue of God doth permit. As namely if ye should (as God forbid) authorise the authoritie of the Bishops, and their preh^minence aboue their brethren, yee should bring into the Kirk of God the ordinance of man, and that thing which the experience of preceding ages hath testifyed to haue been the ground of great idlenes, palpable ignorance, unsufferable pride, pittilesse tyrannie, and shamelesse ambition in the Kirk of God: and finally to haue been the ground of that Antichristian Hierarchie which mounted up on the steps of preheminence of Bishops untill that man of sin came forth as the ripe fruit of man his wisedome, whom God shall consume with the breath of his own mouth.1 Thess. 2.^. Let the sword of God pearce that belly which brought forth such a monster; and let the staffe of God crush that Egge which hath hatched such a Cocatrice. And let not onely that Romane Antichrist be thrown down from the high bench of his usurped authoritie, but also let all the steps whereby he mounted up to that unlawfull preheminence

be cut down and utterly abolished in this land. Aboue all things (my Lords) beware to striue against God with an open and displayed banner, by building up againe the walles of Iericho, which the Lord hath not onely cast down, but also hath layd them under a terrible interdiction and execration: so that the building of them againe must needs stand to greater charges to the builders, then the reedifying of Iericho to H^el the Be the lit in the dayes of Achab. For he had nothing but the interdiction of Ioshua, and the curse pronounced by him to stay him from building again of Iericho. But the Noblemen and States of this Realme haue the reverence of the oath of God made by themselves, and subscribed with their own hands in the confession of faith, called The Kings Mai^^tes, published more then once or twice, and sworn by his most excellent Maiestie, and by his Hignesse Nobi^^tie, Estates and whole subiects of the Realme, to hold them back from setting up the dominion of Bishops. Because it is of veritie that they subscribed and swore the sayd commission, containing not onely the maintenance of the true doctrine, but also of the discipline professed within the Realme of Scotland. Consider also that the worke cannot be set forward without the great slander of the Gospell, defamation of many preachers, and evident losse and hurt of the peoples soules committed to our charge. For the people are brought almost to the like case as they were in Syria, Arabia and Aegypt about the 600 yeare of our Lord, when the people were so brangled and shaken with contrary doctrines, some denying and others allowing the opinion of Eutiches, that in the end th^y lost all assured persuasion of true religion; and within short time thereafter, did cast the gates of their hearts open to the divell to receive that vile and blasphemous Doctrine of Mahomet. Even so the people of the Lord are cast in such admiration to b^^ne the preachers, who so openly damned this stately preheminence of B sh ps, then within a few years after accept the same dignitie, ^ompe and superioritie in their own persons, whi h they before had damned in others, that the people know not which way to incline, and in end will become so doubtfull in matters of religion and doctrine, that their hearts will be like an open taverne d^re, patent to every guest that likes to come in. We beseech your honours to ponder this in the ballance of a godly and prudent minde, and suffer not the Gospel to be slandered by the behaviour of a few number of preachers; of whom we are bold to affirme, that, if they goe forward in this defection, not onely abusing and appropriating that name Bishop to themselves onely,Act 20.17 28. Phil. 1.1. 1. Tim. 3.1.2. P^t. 1.5.7. 1. Pet. 5.1.2. which is common to all the Pastors of God his Kirk, but also taking upon themselves such offices that carry with them the ordinarie charge of governing the civill affairs of the countrey, neglecting their flockes, and s^^king to subordinate their brethren to their iurisdiction. If any of them (We say) be found to step forward in this course of defection, they are more worthy as rotten members to be cut off from the body of Christ, then to haue superioritie and dominion over their brethren within the kirk of God.

The preheminence of Bishops is that Dagon which once alreadie fell before the Ark of God in this land, and no band of yron shall be able to hold him up againe. This is that paterne of that Altar brought from Damascus, but not shewed to Moses in the mountaine, and therefore it shall fare with it as it did with that Altar of Damascus; It came last in the Temple, and went first out. Likewise the institution of Christ was anterior to this preheminence of Bishops; and shall consist and stand within the house of God, when this new fashion of Altar sh^ll goe to the dore. Remember (my Lords) that in time past your authoritie was for Christ and not against him, yee followed the light of God and strived not against it, and like a child in the mothers hand ye said to Christ, Draw us after thee. God forbid that yee should now leaue off and fall away from your former reverence borne to Christ, in presuming to lead him whom the Father hath appointed to be a leader of you, and farre lesse to traile the holy Ordinances of Christ by the cords of your authoritie at the heeles of the ordinances of men. And albeit your Honours haue no such intention to doe any thing which may impaire the honour of Christs Kingdome, yet remember that spirituall darkenesse flowing from a verie smal beginning doth so insinuate and thrust it selfe into the house of God, as men can hardly dis^ern by what secret meanes the light is dimm, and dakenesse creeping in got the upper hand, and in end unawares all is involved within a mystie cloud of horrible Apostasie. And least that any should thinke this our admonition out of time, in so farre as it is statute and ordained already by his Majestie, with advise of his estates in Parliament, that all Ministers provided to Prelacies should haue vote in Parliament: As likewise the generall Assembly (his Majestie being present thereat) hath found the same lawfull and expedient. We would humbly and most earnestly beseech all such to consider, first that the Kingdome of Iesus Christ, the Office bearers and Lawes thereof neither should nor can suffer any derogation, addition, diminution or alteration, besides the prescript of his holy world, by any inventions or doings of men, Civill or Ecclesiasticall. And we are able by the grace of God, and will offer our selues to proue, that this Bishoprie to be erected is against the word of God, the ancient fathers and Canons of the Kirk, the moderne most learned and godly Divines, the doctrine and constitution of the Kirk of Scotland since the first reformation of Religion within the same countrie, the Lawes of the realme ratifying the governement of the Kirk by the generall and Provinciall Assemblies, Pres^yteries and Sessions; also against the weale and honour of the Kings most excellent Majestie, the weale and honour of the Realme and quietnesse thereof, the stablished estate and weale of the Kirk in the doctrine, discipline and patrimonie thereof; the weale and honour of your Lordships, the most ancient estate of this Realme; and finally against the weale of all, and everie one of the good subjects thereof in soule, bodie and substance.

Next, that the Act of Parliament granting vote in Parliament to Ministers is with a speciall provision that nothing thereby bee derogatorie or prejudiciall to the present established discipline of the Kirk and jurisdiction thereof in Generall and Synodall Assemblies, Presbyteries and Sessions. Thirdly and last, the generall Assemblie (the Kings Majestie sitting, voting, and consenting therein) fearing the corruption of that office hath subscribed and bounded the same with a number of Cautions. All which together, with such other as shall be concluded upon by the Assembly, were thought expedient to be insert in the bodie of the Act of Parliament, that is to be made for confirmation of their vote in Parliament, as most necessarie and substantiall parts of the same. And the said Assem^ly hath not agreed to giue thereunto the name of Bishops, for fear of importing the old corruption, pompe and tyrannie of Papall Bishops, but ordained them to be called Commissioners for the Kirk to vote in Parliament. And it is of veritie that according to those Cautions, neither haue those men now called Bishops, entred to that office of Commissioners to vote in Parliament, neither since their engyring haue th^y behaved themselues therin. And therefore in the name of the Lord Iesus Christ who shall hold that g^eat Court of Parliament to judge both the quicke and the dead at his glorious manifestation, and in name of his Kirk in generall, so happily and well establ^shed within this Realme, and whereof the said Realme hath reaped the comfortable fruit of peace and unitie, free from heresie, schisme and dissention these 46 yeares bypast; also in name of our Presbyteries, from which we haue our co^mission, and in our own name, office bearers and Pastors within the same; for discharging of our necessarie dutie, and disburdening of our consciences in particular, We except and protest again^t the said Bishoprie and Bishops, and the erection, confirmation or ratification thereof at this present Parliament: Most humbly craving that this our Protestation may be admitted by your Honours, and registred among the Acts and Statutes of the same, in case (as God forbid) these Bishoprickes bee erected, ratified or confirmed therein.


Archip.
I blesse the Lord for the demonstration of his power in the libertie of his servants, and thinkes the course should haue halted there, if the protestation had been made good by reasons. But they ever object unto you froward affections, and great zeale, with small knowledge and little actions; strong protestations and conclusions upon weak probations, and feeble premisses.


Epaph.
A Disputation is one thing and Protestation is another:Reasons of the Protestation. They had no place the^, nor I pupose now to reason the matter yet for stopping your mouth, and the mind of the adversarie, I shal giue you a view of the reasons that were at that time penned against that first step of Prelacie, according to the heads and order proponed

in the protestation, wherein ye will perhaps behold a copie of the plaine, pertinent and pithie simplicitie of the Ministers of that time: and how new wits with their quiddities, are as far degenerate in knowledge as in affection.


CHAP. I. That the Office of this new sort of Bishops is against the the word of God.

Argum. I.
THat the Ministers of God, separate from the common affaires of the world, sanctified and consecrated to the service of God and salvation of his people, should haue a publick office and charge in the Common wealth and worldly affaires is flat repugnant to the word of God, and particular places of Scripture following, Numb. c. 3 v 4445, And the Lord spake unto Moses saying, take the Levites for all the first borne of the children of Israel, and the Levits shall be mine, I am the Lord. Numb. c. 18. v. 6. For loe I haue taken the Levites from among the children of Israel, who as a gift are given to the Lord to doe the service of the congregation and tabernacle thereof. Deut. 18 12. The Priests and the Levits shall haue no part nor inheritance with Israel, for the Lord is their inheritance, as he hath said unto them. Deut. 10 8 The same time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi to beare the Arke of the covenant of the Lord, to stand before the Lord, to minister unto him and to blesse in his name unto this day. Act. 13 2. Now as they ministred unto the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I haue called them. Rom. 1 v. 1. Paul a servant of Iesus Christ put a part or separat to preach the Gospell of God. These and many more places of Scripture proues the proposition. Then to assume: But so it is, these Bishops are ministers of God by their profession, are counsellers in the Common wealth, Lords in Parliament and conventions of the estates, Lords of Townes, Barones of Lands etc. They run to Court leaving their Ministerie, to get Bishopricks which they haue obtained with all priviledges of the old Bishoprickes which they pride them in, publicklie in the sight of all, and presence of the greatest: Therefore all against the word of God.


Argum. II.
That the Ministers of Christ should be distracted from preaching of the word and doctrine, is direct against the Scripture,

namely these places. Deut. 33 8. And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Vrim be with thy holy one, whom thou didst proue in M^ssah, and did cause him to striue at the waters of Meribah: who said unto his father and unto his mother, I haue not seen him, neither knew be his brethren nor his own children, for they observed thy word and kept thy covenant. They shall teach Iacob thy Judgements and Israel thy Law: they shall put incense before thy face, and the burnt-offrings on thine Altar. Luk. 9 59. Christ said to one, follow me, who answered, suffer me first to goe and burie my father: Christ answered, Let the dead burie the dead, and goe you and preach the Gospell of the Kingdome of God. Another sayes, Maister I would follow thee, but let me first goe and take order with my house, Christ answered, no man that puts his hand to the plough and lookes back, is meet for the Kingdome of God. Act 6 2 Then the twelue called the multitude of the Disciples together, and said, It is not meet that wee should leaue the word of God to serue the tables. Now the Arguments from these places concludes most strongly, a comparatis. For if most necessarie naturall oeconomick, yea even Ecclesiasticall offices, as of Eldership and Deaconship should not distract from the preaching of the word such as hath the gift and calling therto, much lesse should civill and worldly offices and affaires. But yet to insist with strait command and charge and most weightie exhortation and attestation out of the word Iob. 21 15 16 17. So when they had dined, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon son of Jona lovest thou me more then these? he said unto him, yea Lord thou knowest that I loue thee; he said unto him feed my Lambes: he said unto him the second time, Simon the sonne of Iona lovest thou me? he said unto him, yea Lord thou knowest that I loue thee, hee said unto him feed my sheep. Hee said unto him the third time, Simon lovest thou me? Peter was sorie because he said unto him the third time lovest thou me? he said unto him, yea Lord thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I loue thee, Iesus said unto him feed my sheep. 1 Tim. 3 16 Take care of these things till I come, giue attendance to reading, exhortation and doctrine, these things exercise, and giue thy selfe unto them, that it may be seene what thou profites among all men: Take heed to thy selfe and to doctrine, continue therein, for in doing this thou shalt both safe thy selfe and them that heare thee, Again I charge thee therfore before God and before the Lord Iesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing, preach the word, be instant in season and out of season, improue, rebuke, exhort with all long suffering and doctrine. Watch, in all things suffer affliction, doe the work of an Evangelist, make thy ministery fully perswaded, viz. to be a faithfull and good Minister to all. If then the loue of Iesus Christ be in the hearts of Ministers, if the care, attendance and whole occupation and exercise of them ought to be in reading

exhortation and doctrine for the saving of themselves and others if they should preach the word, improue, rebuke, exhort in season and out of season, and make all times seasonable therfore: and no time rightly spent without that. And finally, if they think to stand before that great iudge in that fearfull day of his appearance in glorious and terrible maiestie, as such as haue fully approven that ministerie, to their owne conscience, and the conscience of others in the fight of God: let them see how they may be distracted with civill offices and affaires: and if so to bee, bee not directly against the word of God; seeing they should be singers and chiefe fathers of the Levits in the chambers of the Lords house, having no other charge but to be occupied in that businesse day and night, 1. Chron. 9.33.


Argum. III.
To make and esteeme the charge of soules so light, that therewithall another office and charge civill, publick and worldly, may be ioyned and borne, is direct against the word of God, and particular parts thereof subsequent. But so doe the Bishops, Ezech. 34.^. And the word of the Lord came unto me saying. Son of m^n, prophesie against the Pastors of Israel, and say unto them, Thus sayth the Lord God, Woe be to the Pastors that feed themselves, yee eat the fat and cloath you with the wooll, but yee feed not the flocke, the weak haue ye not strengthened, the sick haue yee not healed, neither haue yee bound up the broken, nor brought again that which was driven away, neither haue yee sought that which was lost, etc. The flocke were scattered without a shepheard, and the sheepe wandred. Zach. 11.17. O idle shepheard that leaves the flocke, the sword shall be upon his arme and upon his right eye: his arme shall be cleane dryed up, and his right eye shal be utterly darkned. Act. 20.20. I haue kept nothing back that was profitable, but haue shewed and taught you openly, and throughout every house. I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men. Take heed vnto your selves, and to all the flock whereof the holy Ghost hath made you overseers, or Bishops to feed the Kirk of God, which hee hath purchased with his own blood. Watch and remember that by the space of three years I ceased not to warne every one both night and day with teares. 1 Pet. 5.2.8. Feed the flock of God, caring for it with a ready minde. Be sober and watch, for your adversarie the Divell goeth about like a roaring Lion, seeking whom he may devoure. 2. Cor. 2.15. For wee are unto God the sweet savour of Christ in them that are saved, and in them that periso, to the one we are the savour of death unto death, and to the other a savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things? For wee are not as many, who make merchandise of the word of God, but as of sinceritie, but as of God in the sight of God speake wee in Christ. Heb. 13.17.

Obey your guides and bee subject unto them, for they witch over your soules, at such as should give an account of them. Wee may then boldly of these Scriptures, and many moe, evidently shew and conclude, that they never knew what the charge of soules meant, that would joyne therewith a publique and politique office and charge: or if they knew it, they never weighed and felt it: they are strangely blinded, benumbed, and miscarryed by Balaams wages.


Argum. IIII.
The mixing, jumbling, and confounding of iurisdictions and callings in one person which God hath distinguished in persons and manner of handling, is against his word. But so it is, that the office of Bishoprie confounds the spirituall and civill iurisdictions and callings in the person of one. Ergo. Numb. 18. vers. 4.5. Yee shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation for all the service of the tabernacle, and no stranger shall come neere unto you, the stranger that comes neere shall bee slaine. The ministers then of Gods service, and the civill rulers are strangers one to another, and should not bee confounded under paine of death. 2. Chron. 19.11. Behold Amarith the Priest shall be chiefe over you in all the matters of the Lord, and Zebadiah the son of Ismael a ruler of the house of Judah, shall be for all the Kings affaires. Deut. 22.9. Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers sorts of seeds, least thou defile the increase of thy seed, which thou hast sowen, and the fruit of thy vineyard: Thou shalt not plow with an Oxe and an Asse together, thou shalt not weare a garment of divers sorts, as of woollen and linnen together. Doth God play the Gardiner, Ploughman or Webster here, or is not this a ceremoniall command to eschew all mixture and confusion in the Lords vineyard, field and shop, which is his Kirk and people. This also the Apostle (1. Corinth. chap. 9.) teacheth us, citing that Ceremoniall command, Thou shalt not mussell the mouth of the Oxe that treadeth out the corne, for the provision of the Ministers of the kirk with things temporall. And finally, our master in the Gospell distinguisheth expresly. Betwixt the things pertaining to God and to Caesar, saying, Give vnto Caesar that which is Caesars, and to God that which is Gods.


Argum. V.
That the Officers of Christs Kingdome should meddle with things not pertaining to the kingdom of Christ, is (...) to bee busie bodies in matters impertinent to them against the

Scripture. But civill and worldly offices and matters pertain not to the kingdome of Christ, and yet are medled with by these Bishops, therefore against the Scripture, Iohn. 6.18. Jesus then knoing that they were come to take him and make him their king, bee withdrew himselfe into the mountaine alone. Ioh. 18.36. Iesus answered and sayd unto Pilat, My kingdome is not of this world. Remembring the vvhich confessions, that Christ was a king, but his kingdome vvas not of this vvorld, the Apostle Paul gives a charge unto Timothie, I charge thee, sayth he, in the sight of God who quickens all things, and before Iesus Christ, who under Pontius Pilat witnessed a good confession, that thou keep this commandement, meaning anent the whole discipline and ruling of the whole kingdome of Iesus Christ, that is not of this vvorld, set down by the Apostle in that Epistle, 1. Tim. 6.13. Ioh. 8.11. Iesus sayd to the adultresse, neither doe I iudge thee, goe and sin no more. Luk. 12.13.14. And one of the multitude sayd vnto him, Master speak to my brother that he may divide the heritage with me, be sayd unto him, O man, who made me a judge over you? The civill and worldly offices then haue nothing to doe with the kingdome of Christ in their persons, and are such as neither Christ nor his Apostles ever took on, or vvould take upon them.


Argum. VI.
That Christs ministers should beare worldly preheminence, bru^k ambitious stiles, and be called gracious Lords, is against the word of God, and speciall scripture vnderwritten. But the office of Bishoprick brings in all these wherin they pride themselues against the scriptures. Mat. 23.6. The Scribes and Pharisees love the first rooms at feasts, and the chiefest rooms in the Synagogues, and salutations in the Markets, and be called Rabbi: But be ye not called Rabbi, for yee haue one master, and ye are all brethren. Let him that is great among you, be a servant: for whosoever will lift himselfe up, shall be c^ften downe, and be that will humble himselfe shall be exalted. Luk. 22.15. There entred a contention among them, who should be greatest; But he sayd vnto them, The Kings of the Nations beare rule over them, and are called gracious Lords, but ye shall not be so, but he that is greatest among you let him be as the least, and he that is the guide as the servant. And in very deed, experience proves that these ambitious stiles vvherewith they are honoured by Heraulds, flattered by a great number, and scorned by farr moe, makes them (as the Apostle speakes of vvidowes) to grow vvanton against Christ, miskenning him, them selues, and their calling, to despise their equals, and to presume over their superiours.



Argum. VII.
That the Souldier of Christ should be involved in the affaires of this life, and one bound to serve two maisters, is flat repugnant to the word of God. But this office of Bishoprick involveth them, etc. Ergo. Numb. 4.3. From thirtie yeare old and aboue, all that are meet to take on this warfare to doe the work in the tabernacle of the congregation. 2. Tim. 2.3.4 Thou therefore suffer affliction as a good souldier of Iesus Christ. No man that warreth entangleth himselfe with the affaires of this life, that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a souldier. It is evident by all these Scriptures, and a number moe which may be brought forth, that the office of these Bishops is repugnant and direct against the word of God. As for Episcopall corruptions in vsurping authoritie aboue the Pastors of the Kirk, and arrogating to them the governme^t of the kirk, which appertains to the common care and counsell of the Elders in Assemblies and Presbyteries by the vvord of God, because they dare not defend, I insist not to lay it out plainly, but think it enough for the present, to quot these places of Scripture and Fathers following, till we heare it brought in question. 1.

CHAP. II. That such a Bishoprie is against the ancient Canons of Kirk, and Councels.
THAT the Pastors and Bishops of the Kirk should set themselves to politicke administration, and court affairs, and bee occupied in secular and worldly matters, leaving their flocks and follow the puffed vp pomp and glory of the world, is against the ancient Canons of the Kirk, namely these following, which as epitomes of many other to the like effect, we are content with for the present. Amongst these most ancient Canons, called the Apost. the 80 Canon 1^, Dicimus, quod non oportet Episcopum aut Presbyterum politicis se administrationibus,

immiscere sed vacare and commodu^ se exhibere usibus Ecclesiasticis: anima^ igitur inducito hoc non facere aut deponito, Nemo enim potest duobus dominis servire. Synod. Nicaena. and Constant. Nemo clericus vel Diaconus vel Presbyter propter causam suam quam libet intret in curiam, quoniam omnis curia a cruore dicta est; Et si quis clericus in curiam introeat anathema suscipiat nunquam rediens ad matrem Ecclesiam. Synod. Chalcedon. oecumenica confes. 15 Ne Episcopi aut Clerici rebus se politicis implicent aut praediae aliena conducant. Sexta Synod. univers Constant. Can. 8. Episcopis non competit Ecclesiastica aut politica eminentia, Episcopus aut Presbyter milit^ae vacans, and volens vtrumque ^rinci^atum humanum, and sacerdotalem dignitatem, deponitor. N^m quae Caesaris sunt Caesari, and quae Dei Deo danda. Ex Epist. Concilii Afri^am ad Papam Caelestinum. Ne famosum ty^hum seculi in Ecclesiam Christi quae lucem simplicitatis and humilitatis videre ^upientibus auf^rt videamur inducere. Synod. Macrensis. Ne rex Pontificis dignitatem, ne Pontifex regiam potestatem sibi usurpare praes^mat, sic actionibus propriis dignitatibusque a Deo distinguuntur ut and Christiani reges pro aeterna vita pontifi i^us ind^g^r^nt and Pontifices pro temporalium rerum cursa regum dis^ositionibus uterentur, quatenus spiritualis actio a carnalibus distaret in cursibus, and ideo militans Domino minime se negotiis saec^daribus implicaret, ac vicissim non ille rebus divinis praesidere videretur. Synod 4 Carthaginensis, Vt Episcopus nullam rei familiaris curam ad se revocet, sed ut lectioni and orationi and verbi tantummodo praedicationi vacet. Synod. Romana. Vniversis clericis interdicimus, ne quis praetextu Ecclesiasticae libertatis suam de caetero jurisdictionem extendat in prejudicium justitiae saecularis, ut quae sunt Caesaris reddantur Caesari, and quae sunt Dei Deo. In the end and conclusion of this point, we would beseech our brethren, who hunts for these Bishoprickes, and pretends much for them Antiquitie, to weigh the words of Damasus, one of the old Bishops of the uncorrupt Kirk of Rome, approved in the Councell of Neocaesarea and Antiochia in anno 371. Damasus and concilium Neocaes. and Antioch. anno 371. Epis opi qui saecularibus intenti curis greges corepiscopis vel vicariis commendant, videntur mihi meretricibus similes quaestatim ut pariunt infantes suos aliis meretricibus tradunt educandos quo suam citius libidinem explere valeant. Sic and isti infantes suos ^i. populos si^i commissos aliis educandos tradunt ut suas libidines expleant ^i. pro suo libitu saecularibus curis inhient and quod unicuique visu^ fuerit liberius agant. Pro talibus enim animae negliguntur, morbi cres^unt, haereses and shismata prodeunt, destruuntur Ecclesiae, sacerdotes vitiantur and reliqua mali proveniunt: non taliter Dominus docuit, nec Apostoli instituerunt, sed ipsi qui curam suscipiunt ipsi peragant and ipsi propros manipulos Domino repraesentent. Nam ipse ovem perditam diligenter

quaesivit ipse propriis humeris reportavit, nosque idipsum facere perdocuit. Si ipse pro ovibus tantam curam habuit, quid nos miseri dicturi sumus qui pro ovibus nobis commissis curam impendere negligimus, and aliis eas educandas tradimus Audiant quaso quid beatus Iacob dixerit socero suo, vigenti annos sui tecum, oves tuae and caprae steriles non fuerunt, ariet^^ gregis tu^non comedi nec captum a bestia ostendi tili: ego damnam omne reddebam; and quicquid furto ^ecierat a me exigebas; die noctuque aestu vrg^bar and gelu, fugi^bat somnus al oculis meis; Si ergo sic laborat and vgilat qui pascit oves Laban, quanto laboriq^an sque vigilus debet intendere qui pascit oves Dei Sed in his omnibus n^s instruat qui dedit pro ovibus suis animam. Let these Bishops then in time bite upon this, who for one preaching made to the people tides fortie postes to Court: for a daies attending on the flocke spends monthes in Court, Councell, Parliament and Conventions; And for a thought or word bestowed for the weale of any soule, cares a hundreth for their apparell, their trayns, fleshly pleasure and gowkit glorie sine: Or they shall be bitten eternally with that worme that never dies, when Christ shall come and call them to account of their dispensation.


CHAP. III. That such a Bishoprie is against the doctrine of the fathers and Doctors of the Kirk ancient and moderne.
THeir bookes are full of this matter consonant to the holy Scripture, and ancient Councels and Canons of the Kirks onely therefore a few testimonies for examples sake. Tertul. de Idolatria cap. 18. Si potestatem nullam ne in suos quidem exer^^it Christus q^ibus so^dido ministerio functus est, si regem se fieri ^onscius s^i reg^i, refugit, ^l^nissi^e dedit formam suis de reiiciendo omni fastigio and suggestu tam dignitatis quum potestatis, quis enim magis his vsus fuisset quam Dei filius? quales enim fasces eum producerent q^^le aurum de capite radiaret ni^ gloriam saeculi alienam and sibi and suis indicasset. Cyril. in Ioan. l. 3. c. 20. Honor and gloria mundi fugienda sunt ^is qui velint gloriam dei consequi. Ambros. in 2 Tim. 2. Eccl^siasticus idcirco Deo se probet ut hinc devotus ^fficium impleat quod spopondit in Dei rebus solicitus a saeculari negotio alienus. Non enim convenit vnum duplicem habere professionem. Bernard. de consideratione ad Eugenium Papam l. 2. c. 4. Apostolis inter dicitur dominatus I ergo tu vsurpare aude, aut dominus Apostolatum, aut Apostolus dominatum* Si utrumque simul habere voles perdes vtrumque. Idem, non monstrabunt, ubi quisquam Apostolorum aliquando judex sederit hominum ^ut

divisor terminorum aut distributor terrarum: stetisse denique Apostolos judicandos, sedisse judicantes non lego. But to saue the strip of this little Treatise, out of the great Ocean of the ancients, leaving Gregorius Nizianzenus, Basilius and Epiphanius of the Greek, and Hieronymus with Augustine chiefe of the Latines, I will conclude with Gregorius the great Bishop of Rome, who at the first entrie of the Hierarchie in the Kirk, and of the tyrannie of the Antichrist, termes John of Constantinople his forerunner, because that hee usurped presumptuouslie aboue the rest, taking to him the stile of universall Bishop. Gregorius ad Theotistam soror^m Imperatoris, de onere curae pastoralis li. 8. Epist. 5. Miror quod in me collatas dudum continentias vestras ex hac moderna pastoralis, officii continentia distraxistis, in qua sub colore Episcopatus ad saeculum sum reductus, in qua tantis terrae curis inservie quantis me in vita Laica ne quaquam deseruisse reminiscor, alta enim quietis meae gaudia perdidi, and intus corruens ascendisse exterius videor. Nem quis inter tot terrenas curas valeat de miraculo praedicare, quum jam mihi difficile sit saltem recolere, pressus enim in hoc honore tumultu saecularium negotiorum ex iis mihi esse videor de quibus est scriptum, dejecisti eos dum allevarentur. Neque enim dixit, dejecisti eos posequam allevati sunt sed dum allevarentur, quis pravi quique cum temporali honore suffulti foris videntur surgere intus cadunt. Allevatio ergo ipsa ruina est, ut quia dum gloria falsa subnixi sunt, a gloria vera evacuantur, hinc iterum dicit, deficientes ut fumus deficerent, fumus quippe ascendendo deficit and sese dilatando evanescit, hinc rursum scriptum est, Deus mi pone illos in rotam, rota quippe ex posteriori parte tollitur and anterioribus cadit, posteriora autem sunt nobis bona praesentis mundi quae relinquimus, anteriora vero sunt aeterna and permanentia ad quae vocamur Paulo attestante, qui ait, quae retro sunt oblitus in ea quae sunt priora me extendens, mihi haec difficilia sunt quia and valde onerosa, and quod mens sponte non recipit congrue non disponit, Ecce serenissimus Dominus imperator fieri simiam Leonem jussit and quidem provisione illius vocari Leo potest, fieri autem Leo non potest. So I end the testimonies of the Ancients with this saying of Cyprian, which I would we should straitly hold, and accurately defend etc. Cyprianus l. 1. epist. 8. Adulterum est, impium est, sacrilegum est quodcunque humano furore instituitur ut dispositio Divina violetur. Now we shall subjoine a few of the most godly learned and approved writers of the most cleare and lightsome age of the Gospell, because there are so many just and full treatises hereanent. Ioh. Calvinus in epist. 2 ad Timoth. 2. Semper Pistorem meminisse oportet veteris proverbii, hoc age, quod significat serio incumbendum esse peragendis sacris, ut studium ejus and intentionem nihil aliud impediat. Pet. Martyr in Loc.

com. class. 4 c. 13. Distingui oportet has functiones civilem and Ecclesiastic^, quia vtraque earum seorsum totum hominem requirit, immo vix vllus unquam repertus est, qui alterutram recte obire posset, adeo est difficilis vtraque provincia. Theod. Bez. Ep. 79. Sed and istud (mi Knoxe) te caeterosque fratres velim meminisse quod jam oculis pene ipsis obversatur: sic ut Episcopi papatu^ pepererunt, ita Pseudo episcopos (papatus reliquias) epicureismum terris invecturos; hanc pestem caveant, qui salva^ Ecclesiam cupiunt. Et cum illam in Scotia in tempora profligaris, ne quaeso illam unquam admittas, quantumvis vnitatis retinendae specie, quae veteres etiam optimos fefellit, ^landiatur. And of this opinion clearly and fully are the French and Helvetian Writers and Kirks. As for the Germanes, ye shal hear their judgements shortly out of one of their most godly and learned writers. David Chytraeus in Mat. 18. Non est autem regni Christi politia sicut regnum mundanum quod constituitur and sustinetur gradibus personarum, potentia, authoritate ferendarum legum, armis and praesidijs distinctis, poenis corperalibus, iudici^s, ordinaria successione, etc. sed est spirituale regnum, in quo non est visibile caput vni loco alligatum and ordinaria successione constitutum, ad quod tota Ecclesia alligata sit, sed v^um Ecclesiae caput est Christus. Deinde etiamsi in Ecclesia sunt gradus personarum and donorum etc. tamen quod ad potentiam politicam imperandi; ferendi leges, cogendi, etc. attinet, omnes inter se sunt aequales and quidem arithmetica aequalitate, nec inter Episcopos quod ad dominum and potestatem attinet, quisquam alio maior est jure divino, ut Luc. 22. Reges gentium dominanturijs, vos autem non sic. Verus igitur and solus gubernator Ecclesiae est ipse Christus sive verbum Dei: hoc solo verbo regit Christus Ecclesiam non gradibus and potentia personarum. Ex hoc loco Math. 18. intelligi potest quomodo regii Pontificum and Episcoporum dominatio cum Evangelio congruat.


CHAP. IIII. That such a Bishoprie is against the doctrine of the Kirk of Scotland preached these 46 yeares.
THE doctrine that the Preachers of Scotland haue been teaching so many yeares since the first reformation, yea since the first light of the Gospell brake forth in this realme, was dir^cted against all corruptions and abuses of the Roman Antichrist, and adulterous kirk of Rome. But so it is that the Bishoprie is one of the greatest errours and corruptions thereof, and have no arguments of Scripture, Fathers, Councells nor reason, but the selfe same that the Papists use. For probation whereof read Bellarmine the Arch-Iesuit, quaest. de capite ecclesiae and de membris, and conferre his

arguments for the Pope and his Hierarchie, vvith Doctor Whitgifts against M. Cartwright, and siclike the rest that write on that head. Secondly, let the auditors yet living of these notable Preachers of the Kirk of Scotland, glorifie God in this matter, and cease not as they love the honour of Christ, ad vveale of his kirk, so long as they are able to speak, to give an evident and full testimonie, what they haue heard of M. Knoxe, M. Cre^g, M. Willockes, M Goodman, M. I^wsen, M Row, M. Ferg^s^ne, M. Arbuthnet, M Rollock, M. Durie, M. Davios^ne, M ^ont, and others most godly, sincere, and learned men, who all ioyned with their continuall powerfull doctrine from Pulpit, their travels; yea and sufferings, in dinging against that Pop^sh corruption of Bishops, till it was all utterly purged and expelled forth of the kirk, and who now resting from their labours, yea triumphing in the heavens, haue left the true discipline and government of the kirk and kingdome of Iesus Christ, well and firmly established and setled within our Kirk; the comfortable effect whereof hath been viuely and sincerely enioyed unto these late dayes. And praised be the name of our God and Christ, there wants not yet successors both to their place and doctrine, able both by preaching and penning to maintaine, yea by his grace not onely by imprisonment, povertie, contempt and trac^^ing of the world, but by their blood to seale up the truth of the same And last, the very mouthes of these now named Bishops, haue been seen and heard preach and professe this veritie; (...) pr^a^h or professe otherwise under pain of Apostasie. H^w (...) ^^w craftily holding both court and kirk in hand, they are like so to proceed, that the part of Demas will plai^^, kythe in the Kirk.


CHAP. V. That this Bishoprie is against the confession of faith called the Kings Maiesties confession, sworne and subscrived at two divers times, viz. in anno 1581 when it was first published; and againe anno 1590. published with a general band for the maintenance of true religion and his Maiesties estate and person; by his Maiestie, his Queen and houshold, and all estates of the Realme. etc.
THE words of that confession for this purpose are these: We abhorre and detest all contrary religion and doctrine, chiefly all kind of Papistrie in generall and particular, even as they are now damned

and confuted by the word of God and kirk of Scotland; and in speciall, the Popes worldly monarchy and wicked Hierarchie, his crossing, annointing, etc. And finally, we detest all his vain rites, signes and traditions, brought into the kirk without or against the word of God and doctrine of this true reformed kirk, to the which we ioyne our selves willingly in doctrine, faith, religion, discipline, and use of the holy sacraments, as liuely members of the same in Christ our head: Promising and swearing by the great name of the Lord our God, that we shall continue in the obedience of the doctrine and discipline of this kirk, and shall defend the same, according to our vocation and power, all the dayes of our lives, vnder the paines contained in the Law, and danger both of body and soule in the day of Gods fearfull judgements. And after a few lines, Wee therefore willing to take away all suspicion of hypocrisie and of double dealing with God and his Kirk, protest, and call the searcher of all hearts to witnesse, that our mindes and hearts doe fully agree with this our confession, promise, oath and subscription: So that we are not moved for any worldly respect, but are perswaded onely in our consciences, through the knowledge and loue of Gods true Religion, printed in our hearts by the holy Spirit, as we shall answer to him in the day when the secrets of all hearts shall bee disclosed. Then if so be that the setting up of Bishops will throw down the discipline of our Kirk, or if that office hath any thing to do with these corruptions of Papistrie and Antichristian hierarchy: The King our Soveraigne, his most excellent and Christian Majestie, and his Highnesse most ancient, religious and noble Estates of Parlament, if there were no other reason but this one, would not for all the world fall under the danger of so horrible a perjurie against God to set up Bishops again; yea, and if it were no more but respect of civil honesty, honor and estimation before the world, they would not be inferiour to Herod in releiving the religion of an oath and great name of God interponed; namely this Confession of faith being put in print twise within the realme by speciall command and priviledge, and translated in all vulgar languages throghout Europe, yea and at his Maiesties coronation in England, put in Latine, and published a new againe by that common post of the world in our age Mercurius Gallobelgicus. But so it is, as all men know, that the discipline and government of the kirk exercised by Presbyteries, and by Bishops, are so opposed one to another, that when the one is set up, the other must down of force. Therefore the subscrivers and swearers of the former confession, if they should (as God forbid) be about to set up Bishops and Episcopall governement, they could not eschew the crime of horrible p^rjurie, execrable Apostasie, and most cursed repairing again of Iericho, from the which the Lord preserve his most excellent Maiesty, and honourable Estates of this present parlaiment. And if any man

doubteth what was the discipline of the kirk of Scotland at the first subscriving and swearing of that confession, let them seek the Register of the general Assembly holden at Glasgow, to the which it was presented, together with a platforme of the whole Presbyteries to be established throughout the Realme by the Laird of Caprinton co^missioner for his maiestie to the sayd assembly in the yeare of God 1581, they shal find that the Bishopries were wholly abolished in the assembly holden at Dundie the yeare immediatly preceeding. So that without al questio^, ^t is meant of the discipline of the kirk exercised by Presbyteries, Synods, and generall Assemblies directly opponed to the corruption and tyranny of Bishops, as vvas clearly defined and ratified in Parliament. After the second subscriving anew againe of the sayd confession in the yeare 1592. In end, seeing these same men, who now would be Bishops, haue once or twice sworne and subscrived this confession, it marvels me vvith what forehead they can be about a purpose so quite contrary thereto.


CHAP. VI. That this office of Bishoprie is against the constitutions of the Kirk of Scotland in her Assemblies.
MAister Knox following the light of holy Scripture, and the advice of Theodor Beza, as he had preached continually, so immediatly before his departure, he wrote to the generall Assemblie convened at Striveling in the yeare 1571 in these words: Vnfaithfull and traytors to the stockes shall yee bee before the Lord Iesus, if that with your consent directly or indirectly yee suffer unworthy men to be thrust in within the ministerie of the Kirke under what pretence that ever it be. Remember the Iudge before whom yee must make an account, and resist that tyrannie, as yee would avoyd hells fire. And this letter is registrat in the acts of the sayd Assembly. In the generall Assemblie convened at Edinburgh in March 1572, sess. 7. M. Iohn Spottiswood superintendent of Lawthiane, gaue in this article. It is neither agreeable to the word of God, nor practise of the primitiue Kirke, that the spirituall administration of the word and sacraments, and the ministration of the civill and criminal justice should be so confounded, that one person may occupie both the cures. Wherfore the whol Assem. refused the Earle of Morton then Regent his desire, to make ministers sessioners in the colledge of Iustice. From that assembly unto the assembly holden at Dundie Iuly 1580, the corruption of the Bishoprie vvas more and more espect, unto the time the vvhole Assem. being ripely advised, and fully resolved all

in one voyce yeelded as followeth: Forasmuch as the office of a Bishop, as it is now used and commonly taken within this realme, hath no warrant, authoritie nor ground in the word of God; but is brought in by the folly and corruption of mans invention, to the great overthrow of the Kirk of God. The whole assembly of the Kirk in one voyce after libertie given to all men to reason in the matter, none opponing himselfe in defending the sayd pretended office, Findes and declares the same pretended office, used and tearmed as is aboue sayd, unlawfull in it selfe, as having neither fundament ground nor warrant in the scriptures of God: and ordaines that all such persons as bruikes or shall bruike hereafter the sayd office, shall bee charged simply to dimit, quyt, and leaue off the same, as an office whereunto they are not called by God. And siclike to desist and ceasse from all preaching of the word, ministration of the sacraments, or vsing any way the office of Pastors, which they receiue de novo admission from the generall Assembly, under the paine of excommunication to bee vsed against them, wherein if they be found disobedient, or contr^vene this act in any poynt, the sentence of excommunication after due admonitions to be execute against them. The yeare following 1581 a forme of establishing Presbyteries throughout all the shires of the Realm were sent from his Maiestie to the general assembly convenced at Glasgow, and commissioners both from his Maiesty and the generall assembly nominate and ordained to plant Presbyteries in all parts convenient. The which being done, not onely ceased all ruling of bishops, but also in the generall assembly at Edinburgh in August 1590 all commissioners from generall assemblies appointed for visitation of Provinces, were ordained to cease, where presbyteries were planted, ^o root out all danger of tyranny and authoritie of sole government within the Kirk: and that because they perceived that sort of sole government to be against the word of God, and that Iesus Christ had ordained his kirk to bee ruled by the common care and councell of his lawfully called Pastors, Doctors, Elders and Deacons in their meetings and assemblies. And where some, that knowes not, may think that these generall assemblies at which the kings maiestie was present, holden since the 7 of December 1596, hath altered these co^stitutions, there is no such thing. Therefore leaving off how matters proceeded since that time, as known to the whole Realme, I will onely set downe out of the Regi^ter of the Kirk what vvas done.
The generall assembly holden at Dundie March 1597, Sess. 11. The generall Assem. votes findes and concludes that it is necessary and expedient for the weale of the kirk, that the ministers as the third estate of the Realme in name of the kirk, have vote in Parliament. Sess. 12. Concerning the number of the Ministers that should haue vote in Parliament i^ name of the kirk, it was likewise concluded and thought expedient, that

as many of them as should bee chosen for the vote in Parliament, as were wont of old in time of the Papisticall kirk to be Bishops, abbots and Pryers, that had the like libertie, viz. to the number of fiftie one or thereby. Item, after reasoning it was voted and concluded, that the election of such of the ministerie, as should haue vote in parliame^t, ought to be of a mixed qualitie, and appertaines partly to his maiesty, and partly to the kirk. In the generall assembly at Montrose 1600 in March. sess. 6. Concerning the manner of choosing of him that shall haue vote in parliament in name of the Kirk, it is condiscended upon, that he shall be first recommended by the kirke to his Maiestie, and that the Kirk shall nominate six for every place that hath need to be filled, of whom his Ma. shall choose one whom he best likes, and his Ma. promises oblishes and binds himselfe to choose no other but one of that number. And in case his Ma. refuse the whole upon a just reason of insufficiencie, or greater sufficiencie of others that are not recommended; the Assembly shall make a new recommendation of men according to the first number, of the which one by his Ma. shall be chosen without any further refusal, or new nomination. And he that shalbe chosen by his Ma. shall be admitted by the Synods. It is concluded that the general assembly shal haue the nomination or recommendation of him, that in name of the Kirk shall vote in parliament, who shall take the advice of the Synods and Presbyteries thereanent directed from them in writ. And the Synods shall have libertie to nominate, as well within the Province as without, providing that if there bee a man within the Province meet for the place caeteris paribus, hee bee preferred to any other. Anent his rent, it is advised with one consent, that the Kirk being planted sufficiently, the colledges and schooles already erected, not prejudged, that the King shall provide him to all the rest that may be obtained of that benefice, where he is preferred.

The Cautions.
AS to the cautions to keep him that shall have vote in parliament from corruption, they be these following.
1 That bee presume not at any time to propone at Parliament, Councell, or Convention, any thing in name of the kirk, without an expresse warrant and direction of the kirk, vnder the paine of deposition from his office. Neither shall hee consent or keepe silence in any of the sayd conventions, to any thing that may be preiudiciall to the weale and libertie of the kirk under the sayd paine.
2 Hee shall bee bound at every generall Assembly, to giue an account anent the discharge of his commission, since the assembly going before, and shall submit himselfe to their censure, and stand to their determination whatsoever, without appellation, and shall seeke and obtaine ratification of his doings at the sayd Assembly vnder the paine of infamie and excommunication.
3 He shall content himselfe with that part of the benefice, which shall be given to him by his maiesty for his living, not hurting nor preiudging the rest of the ministers of the kirk within his benefice planted, or to bee planted, or any other minister of the country whatsoever, and this clause to be insert in his provision.
4 He shall not dilapidate in any way, neither set nor make disposition thereof without the speciall advice and consent of his Maiesty and general assembly. And for the greater warrant thereof, he shall interdict himselfe not to dilapidate his benefice, nor consent to dilapidation thereof made by others, to the generall assembly, and shall be content that inhibitions bee raised on him to that effect.
5 He shall be bound faithfully to attend upon his own particular congregation, where he shall be minister in all the poynts of a Pastor, and hereanent shall be subject to the triall and censure of his own Presbyterie and Provinciall assemblie, as any other min^ster that beares not commission.
6 Jn the administration of discipline, collation of benefices, visitation and al other poynts of Ecclesiastical government, he shal neither usurp nor acclaime to himselfe any power or Iurisdiction, further then any other of the rest of his brethren, except he be imployed by his brother, under the paine of deprivation. And in case hee usurpe any part of the Ecclesiasticall government, and the Presbyteries, Synodall or generall Assemblies oppone and make any impediment thereto, whatsoever (...) do after that impediment to be null ipso. facto without any declaratorie.
7 In Presbyteries, provinciall and generall Assemblies, hee shall behaue himselfe in all things, and be subiect to their censuring, as any of the brethren of the Presbyterie.
8 At his admission to his office of commissionarie those and no other poynts necessarie, he shall sweare to subscribe and fulfill under the penalties foresayd, and otherwise not to be admitted
9 And in case he be deposed by the general Assembly, Synod or Presbyterie from his office of the ministery, he shall also tyne his vote in Parliament ipso facto, and his benefice shall vaike.
And further caution to be made, as the kirk pleases and findes occasion anent his name that for the kirk should vote in parliament, it is advised by vniforme consent of the whole brethren, that he shall bee called commissioner of such a place.
It is also statute and ordained, that none of them that shall haue vote in Parliament, shall come as commissioners to any generall Assembly, nor have vote in the same in any time comming, except he be authorized with a commission from his own presbyterie to that effect.
It is moreover found by the Assembly, that crim^u ambitus shall bee a sufficient cause of deprivation of him, that shall have vote in parliament.
Sess. 8. The generall Assembly having reasoned a^ length the question anent his commission, who shall vote in Parliament, whether he should endure for his life time, except some crime or offence intervene, or for a shorter time at the pleasure of the Kirk, Findes and decernes that he shall annuatim giue accompt of his commission obtained from the Assemblie and lay down the same at their feet to be continued or altered therefrom by his Majestie and the Assemblie, as the Assem. with consent of his Ma^. shall think expedient to the weale of the Kirke. Whose whole conclusions being read in audience of the whole assembly, and they being ripely advised therewith, ratified, allowed and approved the same, and thought expedient that the said Cautions, together with such others as shalbe concluded upon by the Assemblie, be insert in the bodie of the Act of Parliament, that is to be made for confirmation of vote in Parliament to the Kirk as most necessarie and substantiall parts of the same.

Then briefly to assume and conclude, but so it is that their new L. B. neither in the entrie to their office, nor yet in their behaviour therein, hitherto haue kept one jot of these constitutions and cautions, but hath broken all; therefore such roomes and offices should not be confirmed to them in this present Parliament.




CHAP. VII. That the Office of Bishoprie is against the lawes of this Realme.
OVr Soveraigne, the Kings most excellent Majestie came into the world, and entered to his Kingdome of this Realme; with the cleare light of the Gospell, and the establishing of a reformed Kirk, and therfore as a most godly and Christian Prince hath in his all Parliaments confirmed, ratified and approved the freedome and libertie of the true Kirk of God, and religion publickly professed within his Majestie Realme, as in his first Parliament holden by his Majesties good Regent the Earle of Murray, Likewise in his Highnesse second, holden by his grandfather the Earl of Lennox; the same is ratified in the first Act of his first Parliament holden after the taking of the governement in his Highnesse own person. Also in the first of his sixt Parliament holden at Edinburgh the 20 of October 1579. Our Soveraigne Lord with advice and consent of his three Estates, and whole bodie of this present Parliament ratifies and approues all and whatsoever Acts and Statutes made of before by his Highnes, with advice of his Regents in his own reigne, or his Predecessors, anent the libertie and freedom of the true Kirk of God and religion now presently professed within this realme, and specially etc.
The second act of the same sixt Parliament is expresly for the jurisdiction of the Kirk which is there said to consist and stand in the preaching of Iesus Christ, correction of manners, and adminstration of the holy Sacraments; and declares that there is no other face of a Kirk, nor other face of Religion, then is presently by the favour of God established within this realme. And that there be no other Iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall acknowledged within this Realm other then that which is and shal be within the same kirk, or that which flowes there from concerning the premisses. And in his Majesties seventh Parliament at Edinburgh, October 1581. In the first Act there is a generall ratification of the libertie of the true Kirk of God, and confirmation of all the Actes and Lawes made to that effect before, by particular rehearsall and catalogue, and amongst the rest, The ratification of the libertie of the true Kirk of God and religion, and anent the Iurisdiction of the Kirk of God twice. And after the Kings perfect age of 21 yeares in the eleventh Parliament, At Edinburgh Iuly 1587, there is a cleare and full ratification of all Lawes made anent the libertie of the Kirk.
Now if any will say, what is all these Actes against the Bishops? I say, direct: for whatsoever is for the Ministers, Presbyters and Assemblies, is against the Bishops: But so it is that all these Acts are for the^, because as we haue shown, the doctrine and constitutions of the Ministers and Assemblies, hath been ever since the reformation, against the corruption of Bishops, and that is the freedom, libertie and discipline of the Kirk which is confirmed, for verification whereof we alledge first the Confession of faith confirmed by Parliament and registred among the Actes thereof, wherein the 19 Article anent the notes of the true Kirk, ye haue last Ecclesiasticall Discipline uprightly ministred as Gods word prescrived: But so it is, that out of the Word the doctrine of the Ministers hath been against the Bishops, as also the discipline set down in the Generall Assemblies. Next that the first Act of his Majesties Acts of Parliament. Our soveraigne Lord with advice of his three estates and whole bodie of this present Parliament, hath declared and declares the Ministers of the blessed Evangell of Iesus Christ, whom God of his mercie hath now raised up to be the true and holy Kirk. Thirdly, that golden Act which clearely crownes and formally concludes the cause; viz. the first Act of the 12 Parliament of King James the 6. At Edinburgh Iunii 1592 intitulate, Ratification of the libertie of the true Kirk, of generall and synodall Assemblies of the Presbyteries of Discipline, which speakes this plainly in the end. Item our Soveraigne Lord and Estates in Parliament foresaid abrogates, casses and annulles the Act of Parliament made in anno 1584 granting commission to B. and other Iudges constitute in Ecclesiasticall

causes to receiue his Highnesse presentation to Benefices, and giue collation thereupon, and to put order in all causes Ecclesiasticall, which his Majestie and Estates foresaid declares to be expired in it selfe, and to be null in time comming, and of none availe, Force nor effect. And therfore ordaines all presentations of Benefices to be direct to particular Presbyteries in all time comming, with full power to giue collation thereupon, and to put order to all manners and causes Ecclesiastical within the bounds according to the discipline of the Kirk. And finally the act of annexation of the temporalitie of the benefices to the crown of necessitie, demolishes and beares down all the Bishops, Iam. 6 Parl. 1^ cap. 29.


CHAP. VIII. That they are against the honour of God and his Christ.
THe standing for the maintenance of the kingdome of God, and, whom hee hath anointed his King upon his holy mountaine, the Lord Iesus Christ, is to their honour; like as to slide from it and leaue it, to follow after the world, is against the honour of God and Christ. To hear the word of God and to do it, is the special honouring of God, and of that great Pastor of the sheep the Lord Iesus Christ: As by the co^trary the rejecting of his word, and casting it off behind their back is his dishonour. And finally to build and plant with God is to honour him, so to cast down and root out that, which by the Ministerie of his notable servants he hath builded and planted is to his high dishonor: But so it is, as I haue verified and shown, that Bishopricks makes men to slide away from the Kingdome of Christ, to leaue it, and follow the world, to reject his word and cast it behind their back: And finally to cast down and root out, that which Christs faithfull servants hath bigged and planted, even that sincerity of the Gospell and freedom of the Kirk of Christ brought to such perfection, and so well established, and left unto us by them: and so with the Scribes and Pharises to seek the glory of men rather then of God, and to seek honor one of another, and not to honour Christ nor to seek to be acceptable unto him.
And is it not, alas, a horrible dishonouring of God, and the preaching of his blessed veritie and vvord, to flatter men and annoint their filthie flesh with earthly honor, wealth and sensualitie, to make Christs holy Ministers to be loathed, sclandered and evil spoken of. And as the Lord rebuked Eli the Priest and his sons, vvhose sinnes vvere great before the Lord, in making men to abhorre the Lords Ministers and offerings: Therfore the Lord threatned them by Samuel saying: Wherfore haue ye kicked against my sacrifice and my offrings which I commanded in my tabernacle, and honors thy children aboue me,

to make your selfe fit of the first fruits of all the offerings of my people Israel, wherefore the Lord God of Israel saith, I said thy house and the house of thy fathers should walke before me for ever: But now the Lord saith it shall not be so: for they that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be despised. And now, O yee Priests, cryed Malachie, this commandement is for you, if ye will not heare it not consider it in your heart to giue glorie unto my name, J will even send a curse upon you, and will cursse your blessings; yea, I haue cursed them alreadie, because ye doe not consider it in your hearts. Behold I will corrupt your seed, and cast dong upon your faces, even the dong of your solemne feasts, and ye shall be like unto it: and yee shall know that I haue sent this commandement unto you, that my covenant which I haue made with Levi, might stand, saith the Lord of hosts. My covenant was with him of life and peace and equitie, and he did turne many away from iniquitie. For the Priests lips should preserue knowledge, and they should seek the Law at his mouth, for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts. But ye are gone out of the way, ye haue caused many to fall by the Law, ye haue broken the covenant of Levi, saith the Lord of hosts Therefore I haue also made you to be despised and vile before all the people, because yee keep not my wayes.


CHAP. IX. That this Bishoprie is against the honour and weale of the Kings Majestie.
IS it not the Kings vveale and honour to honour God, to loue, fear and obey him, to be wise and learned, to serue God in fear, and rejoice in trembling, to kisse the Son lest he be angry; to be a nurs-father to the Kirk, to be an avenger of all breakers of Gods holy law and misorders against his manifest word and truth: And in a vvord to raign in Christ, by Christ, and vvith Christ, and against the sinne that drawes him to the contrarie? Is it not the weale and honour of his Maj. to hold himselfe in the favour of God, and that reverent loue and good estimation of all that feares God unfeignedly, and loues the Lord Iesus Christ, by holding fast that profession of the sincerity of the Gospell, in doctrine and discipline, wherof his H. and Kingdome in this Iland namely, hath found comfort and profit, that all the godly this day triumphes in, all the vvicked envie, Europe is astonished with admiration, at that union of these Kingdomes under one God and Christ, one King, one Faith, one Law, and under his Majestie advanced and highly lifted up throne, far aboue all Kings Throns in Christendom, in this respect and for this cause, namely that his Highnes was borne and entred to reign at the light and sinceritie of the Gospel; hath reigned so long, so happily, so peaceable with the same; and he and his posterity in hope and

good appearance holding fast the same to reigne most blessedly even to that appearance of Christ the King of Kings from the heavens. Is it not his Majesties weale and honour to stand fast to that confession of faith sworne and subscrived by his Highnesse, for good example to his houshold, estates and all his subjects, extant in all languages, affixed as it were on the most high pillar in the great Theater of Europe, testifying and proclaiming to all, his Majesties pietie, sinceritie and zeale to the Gospell of Christ and his Kingdome, against all corruption and thraldome of the Antichrist of Rome? And against his weale and honour that leades him to the contrarie? Is it not the weale and honour of his Royall Majestie, to haue all the hearts of the most sincere Protestants and professors of the holy Evangell; not onely throughout great Brittaine, but also France, Germanie, Switzerland and Sweden, to be as it were the heart of one man, to ware all their bloud for his Majesties safetie in person, encrease in honour, and stabilitie in estate; by holding fast unaltered or mixed the sincere simplicitie of the Gospell, and doctrine, sacraments and discipline, which they haue so long professed with his Majestie, and against the which what cursed force or businesse was ever able to prevaile unto this houre? And finally, is it not his Majesties weale and honour to be safe and free from the falshood, flatterie and crueltie of ambitious avarice, which hath brought so many notable Emperours, Kings and Princes to tragicall ends, corrupted sincere Kirkes, and overthrowne flourishing Common-wealthes? And verily this venome and poyson of humane Bishops, degenerating into Satanicall, hath filled the Ecclesiastical and civill histories full of such effects, the smallest haire of root and pickle of seed is therefore to be fanned away and plucked out of all Kirkes, Kingdomes and Common-wealthes This the godly wisedome, quicknesse of wit, prudence and sagacitie of the King, who is as an Angell of God, can well marke, and take up a farre, both to beware of it where he hath found it, and can not well amend it, and not to permit to creep into the field so carefully and cleane purged therefrom. Thus passing over the impairing of the Kings patrimonie, and many moe things against his Highnesse weale and honour, for brevities sake I end this point, not doubting but his Majestie is alwaies mindfull of that declaration, so clearely, godly and eloquently penned and subscribed by his Highnesse own hands, at his Majesties Parliament holden at Linlithgow in December 1585. The conclusion whereof is most worthie of remembrance at this time, for that by forgetting that, these who seek Episcopall dignitie seekes the hurt and dishonour of his most renowmed Majestie. Then shortly to end this my declaration,

I mind not to cut away any li^ert^ granted by God to hi^ Kirk, I ac^lame not my selfe to be judge of doctrin^ in Religion, s^^^tion, heresies or true interpretation of Scripture etc. And in end, My intention is not to (...) with excommunication, neith^^ ^^^^me to my selfe or my (...) power in an^ ^^ng that (...) weer Ecclesiasticall, neither to meddle in any that God w^^^^ th^ w^y d^v^lv^ in th^ ^^nds of the Kirk* ^nd to conclude I conf^sse and ^^k^ (...) ^ge Christ Iesus to (...) He^d and Lawgiver to the same. And wh^t^^^v^r persons (...) themselves as he^d of the Kirk and not (...) thing that the word of God (...) mi^^^^ to his Kirk; that m^^ I f^^ ^^mmi^ts manifest (...) against the (...) the words of his Son; against (...) S^n^^ not ^^y g^^i^, and in t^king his place; against th^ (...) Ch^^^t, the (...) how Spirit ^hing contr^^y (...) to his cons^i^n^e. Certainly thus h^^^ouri^g G^d and Iesus Christ his Highnes shall be w^ll and honourable, according to that promise, I will know him that honours me.


CHAP. X. That this Bishoprie is against the honour and weale of the Realme.
WH^rein hath stood thy honor and weale o Scotland these (...) y^ares and aboue. Was it not, in the ^^gement of all th^^^ (...) ^^ghtly, ^^th sincerity of the Gospel and freedom of Iesus Christs ^^^^^om est^^^ (...) ^o notably within thee vvith so (...) that Gospel of peace came vvithin th^ (...) forraine w^^, and all comm^tions vvithin thy (...) beene easily setled, God b^^ng in the m^^st of th^^ (...) bringing (...) judgement upon all th^t (...) their hea^, (...) their (...) against his Kirk. And (...) so ^o ^^^h and bevvitched, is not (...) hold fast that vv^^y, having h^d Christ so cl^^rly ^^^^ted forth before thy eyes as if ^h^m with the same had seene hi^ crucified? Shalt thou vvi^h those foolish G^l^tians begin in the spirit and end in the fl^sh. W^^ th^^^ follovv th^m, of vvhom the Apostle vveeping (...) vvrite, that th^y are enemies to the crosse, whose end i^ destruction or damnation, who God i^ their ^^lly, whose glorie i^ shame, earthly minded men vvho seekes not the glory of Christ, not safety of the soules of thy people, but to be thy guiders, and misgui^ thee; to be thy conduct^r, and sedu^^ thee, to make thee to sinne against God after the manner of the golden Calues, at Dan and Bethel, that so the Lord may be in^en^^d and cast thee avvay from his face? They seeke gl^rie amongst men and one of another, and so neither can beleeue and trust in Christ themselues,

not make thee doe it and be safe. Surely for wealth and honour worldly thou was never comparable to other nations, but the Evangell so planted in thee was that crown of thy glorie, that decored thy head, and set it up aboue all Realmes and Kingdomes upon the face of the earth. Hearken, dear mother, what the Lord said unto his people Israel of old, and take it now to be spoken unto thee.Deut. 4. Aske from the times of old that haue been before thee, even from that day that God created man upon the earth f^^th one end of the heaven unto the other, if there was done such a thing as this is, or if there hath been heard he like of it If any God hath essayed to come and take unto him a nation out of the midst of another nation, with proofes and signes and wonders, with war strong hand and stretched out arme; finally with most great terrours according to all that Iehov^h hath done for you, even your God to bring you out of the land of Egypt.2 Sam. 7.23.24. What nation is like thy people Israel in all the earth, which for to be a people went to redeem, and hath gone to get himselfe a name, and to worke these great things and mightie, reverently to be admired, expelling from the face of thy people whom thou redeemed to thee out of Egypt the Nations and their Gods: for thou hast established thy people Israel that it may be a people unto thee for ever, and thou Iehovah their God.Psal. 147. Who telleth his word to Iacob, his Statutes and Lawes to Israel, he hath not done so to my nation: therefore they know not these Lawes, Praise yee the Lord. Was not Papistrie thy Egypt, o Scotland, and did not the Lord deliver thee out of it, and safeing thee from that tyrannie and thraldome brought thee unto a pleasant Canaan of his Gospell to serue him in spirit and truth: and that in such a manner and forme, as the like was never heard nor seene? And no lesse miraculously hath he made thee to dwel therin so long, so safely, so freely: and shalt thou then goe and make to thee other Captaines by Moses and Aaron, yea contemning them thy lawfull Priests and Levites, to lead thee back again into Egypt? God forbid, But so it is (deere natiue country) your Seers see, and your Watchmen giues you a faithfull warning, crying to you, that the Episcopall Hierarchie is verie Papistrie, and spirituall Egypt. Howbeit by the pollicie of men, otherwaies buskit, attired and dressed to take the foolish and simple withall. It is no other thing in the substance thereof, taken from the last and grossest dung of Antichrist, making the Kingdome of Christ to be of this world, turning the spirituall worshipping of God in outward toyes and ceremonies, bringing the pompe of the world into the simple and humble Kirk; yea corrupting the fountaines of the waters of life, and empoysoning the food of the soules to work dangerous sicknesses and deadly diseases amongst thy sonnes and daughters. The whole Pulpits hath sounded unto you so many years, and yet continues to sound where they are not emptied or terrified by their

tyrannie. Admitting that Bishoprie againe, lost is your honour, wracked is your welfare, and gone is your grace and garland of heavenly and spirituall glorie for ever. Forget not the first essay of their good service in Parliament to God, the Kirk and Commonwealth, in giving their votes and suffrages to seventeen erections of the Prelacies and livings of the Kirk in temporall Lordships to attaine thirteen rounged and dilapidate Bishoprickes, as was reported and complained upon to the Kings Majestie and his Councell at Hampton Court, 1606.


CHAP. XI. That Bishoprie is against the constitution and setled estate of the Kirk and Kingdom, and so most dangerous.
ITt is an Axiom approved in Experience and Policie. Quod omnis mutatio Reipub. est periculosa etiamsi in melius, how much more in deterius. The reason then holdeth thus. All dangerous things for the estate and common-wealth are to bee eschewed: But change is dangerous, namely from such an estate, which is conforme to the word of God, good Lawes and Constitutions, the judgement of the holiest and best learned, ancient and moderne, the best estate of the Primitiue Kirk, and best reformed Kirkes from corruption of Papistrie, to an estate plaine contrarie, and so most perverse and pernicious. For let Lawyers and Politiques reason and judge the civill part for the estate of the Kingdome, we dare boldly conclude, as we haue evidently proved, that it is pernicious for the Kirk of Iesus Christ: And that which is pernicious thereto can never stand with the good estate of a Christian Kingdome and godly Common-wealth. It is so cleare in the Histories, and miserable experience of these last Ages of the would that it needs no probation, being acknowledged and affirmed by all Protestants, that the Popish Hierarchie and usurpation of both the swords, hath brought the Romane Empire, and all Kingdomes and Commonwealths in Europe that haue not resisted the same, to abominable and most filthie servitude and slaverie, in their goods, bodies and soules. And those who haue cast off the yoke of that bondage, and resisted thereunto haue been involved in bloudie battels, and had great fear and adoe to keep them safe from the most craftie and cruel practises of that pestilent throne of kirk ambition and avarice. And shal the dr^gs, or rather sprowtings therof be brought in again into Scotland: Shall these si^lings and sprowrings be taken up and set with guiding again in the Lords vineyard

to grovv up to seed, to shake and overgrovv the same? Or shall these dregges be cast in a Limbique, and such Aquavitie to be dravvn thereof as vvill make the braines of all giddie that tasts thereof? Shall these Co^katrice egges be hatched in our Kingdome of nevv, vvhereof all Kings, Kingdomes and Estates that h^ue ^a^en therof (...) dead in sin, and spirituall and temporall slave^^^ And such (...) marked therevvith doe cry as if they vvere stung vvi^h (...)? The Lord safe our kirk, kingdom and K^^^ (...) k^s.
W^ (...) ^fore, th^ Lavves of our Kingdome, the constitutions of our Kirk, the doctrine and confession thereof, vvhereunto all th^ members both of Kirk and Commonvveal^, and Kingdome haue solemnly svvorn and subs^rived, and vvhich hath b^en professed, established, and stood in our Kirk and Kingdom almost novv an vvhole Iubile of yeares. To all the vvhich this Bishoprie, this usurpation of both Offices Civill and Ecclesiasticall the temporall Lordship, the earthly dominion, the worldly vain pomp and the most dangerous invasion of governing both court and kirk is most repugnant. And yet notwithstanding the walles of our Tr^^, which were builded by the finger of our God, must be demolished, and we with our own hands hail in that devilish Grecian horse within the Lords Citie, to set it all on fire. O mad folly! o terrible Judgement for the contempt of the Gospell and fruitlesse abuse of the freedome thereof, so long, so liberally and so gloriously bestowed on Scotland!


CHAP. XII. This Bishoprie is against the honour and weale of the Noble Estates of Parliament.
THe honour and weale of the Noble Estates of Parliament, namely since the light of the Gospell shined in our dark nation, vvas to haue the Kirk of God and libertie of this most ancient Kingdome in speciall are fall regard, to make good lawes in favour of the same a^^ to s^e them haue life and vigor by due execution. An^ for that st^^ct to haue a solemne and free advice and you, w^thout ^^e vvh^^h (...) thing should passe and be effectuall by any o^^oy, pl^t or pract^se whatsoever. But set ^nce up these B shops once (called l^^g since the Princes Ledho^^e) thing ^f th^y were never so unlawful, unjust, ungodly and pernitious to Kirk and Realme, If they shall be borne forth by the countenance, authoritie, care and endevour of the King (supposing such a one, a God forbi^, come in the roome of our most renoumed Soveragine (for as to the best hath oftentimes

succeeded the worst) they shall be caried through by his Bishops set up and entertained by him for that effect, and the rest of the estates not onely be indeed as cyphers, but also beare the blame thereof to their great evill and dishonour. And if one will aske how shall these Bishops be more subiect to be carried after the appetite of an evill prince, then the rest of the estates. The answer and reason is, because they haue their Lordship and living, their honour, estimation, profit and commoditie of the King by others. The King may set them vp, and cast them downe, give them and take from them, put them in and out at his pleasure. And therefore they must bee at his direction to doe what liketh him, and in a word, he may doe with them by law, because they are set vp against law: but with other estates hee cannot doe so, they having either heritable standing in their roomes by the fundamentall lawes, or then but a commission from the estate that send them, as from the Burgesses or Barones. Againe, if one would say, Howbeit the Bishops and all the spiritualll estate vvere corrupted, yet there is two or three estates beside? Wee answer first, there is a great number of the other estates, whereof it is easie to make choyce of some, that for certaine commoditie and advancement of their state and matters, may be easily corrupted. Next, deprave me once the Ecclesiasticall estate, which hath the gift of knowledge and learning by others, and are supposed, because they should bee of best conscience, that so they are, the rest will easily bee miscarried. And that so much the more, that the officia^s of estate, Lords of Session, Iudges, Lawyers that haue their offices of the King, are commonly framed after the courts aff^ction. Yea, let Chancellor, Secretarie, Thesaurer, President, Controller, and others that now are, take heed that th^se new Prelats of the Kirk as convetous and ambitious as ever they were of old, insinuating themselues by flatterie and obsequence in the Princes favour, attaine to the bearing of all these offices of estate and crowne, and to the exercising thereof, as craftily, avaritiously, proudly, and cruelly, as ever the Papisticall Prelates did. For as the holi^st b^st and wisest Angels of light, being depraved, became most wi^ked, craf^^^ and cruell Divells, so the learnedest and best pastor perverted and poysoned by that old serpent with avarice and ambition, becomes the falsest, worst, and most cruell man, as experience in all ages hath proved. A further consideration of this poynt also we leaue to the Lawyers, Politiques, and Statesmen.



CHAP. XIII. That this Bishoprie is against the weale of all Scottishmen in soule body and goods.
HOwbeit that this be cleare enough of all that haue been spoken in the chapters preceding, yet particularizing the same, we will make it more cleare. Wee call them good Scottishmen, that have a true sence of the honour of God, love of their Christ, care of the sinceritie of the Gospell, and libertie of his Kirke, a feeling of the need of their soules, a hunger and thirst for righteousnesse, and that word of life which is the food therof, and therewithall a loue of their natiue countrey, of the freedome and weale of the same. Now this Bis^oprie shall ei^her take away all true religion and sinceritie of the Gospell, or then the fruitfull vse thereof for the feeding and comfort of soules. For if there arise a Popish or prophane Prince, they must alter with h^m, and please and obey him, or tyne their places, their honours, their riches and pleasures, the which they will not doe, because they have already given their consciences, honestie, truth and credit before God and man, as a price for these things of the world. And put case true religion stand, what care will they haue of feeding of soules, who haue sold their owne for the world. All their care and travell must bee to keep their Court, please the King, acquire and conserve more plentie of goods, honour and pleasures. And they being thus set and given, their inferiour ministers for the most part will follow their fashions, so there shall bee nothing amongst men but atheisme, licentiousnesse and profanitie. For as concerning discipline, it being put into the hands of Bishops, they will make merchandise of it, or let the reines thereof loose in favour of this or that great man, or of one Courteor or other, as hath ever been the nature and custome of thes^ Bishops to be men pleasers, and hunters after the favour and friendship of the world, not daring to displease or adhere unto the execution thereof upon others, least it should strike upon themselues commonly more guiltie and slanderous then any other. And thus the true worship of God, and care of the salvation of soules, shall utterly perish, Next, I call them good Scottish men, who haue a care and loue of the libertie of their countrey, and of their bodies to liue as free men therein in safetie and good health. But so it is this Bishoprie will bring the countrey, the lawes, the priviledges thereof with the bodies of men in slaverie,

servitude and riotous dissolution, which breedes manifold diseases, distruction and death of body. For if any succeeding Prince please to play the tyrant, and governe all not by lawes, but by his will and pleasure, signified by missiues, articles, and directions, these Bishops shall never admonish him as faithfull pastors and messengers of God (for that they are not, having no lawfull calling nor authoritie from God and his kirk) but as they are made up by man, they must and will flatter, pleasure and obey men. And as they stand by affection of the Prince, so will they by no meanes jeopard their standing, but be the readiest of all to put the Kings will and pleasure in execution; and it were to take and apprehend the bodies of the best, and such namely as would stand for the lawes and freedome of the Realme, and cast them in dark and stinking prisons, put them in exile from their natiue land, etc. Attour and besides this, vnlesse that men of whatsoever estate or ranke they be, cap and kneele to them, give them their ambitious stiles, places and salutations, slavishly abusing their bodies against their hearts, they shall not misse their indignation to be interest, and crossed, and wronged in their ca^ands and affaires, and to bee traduced at Court by them or by their meanes. Last, their companie and entertainment will be an example of ryot and excesse, whereto that Bishoprie is much given. And if thus the Realme, the lawes and priviledges therof, and the persons of good Scotishmen may be used, it is easie to gather the like of their goods and geare. The Bishop in his owne citie, and among his vassals, will thinke himselfe a pettie Roy, vvho dare deny to lend, to give, to serve them, with whatsoever they haue? or if they doe deny, can they not and their Lawyers, Domestiques, Dependaries, devise the way how to get him to the Horne, or into some inconvenience and danger of the law, and then their whole goods and estate falling into the Bishops hands, they shall bee pilled and polled sickerly, The pittifull experience in times past, makes us bold to give the warning for the time to come: for it hath been seen and felt, and yet dayly is in this Iland. And finally, it is already too manifest, that if the Prince bee prodigall, or would inrich his Courtiers by taxations, imposts, subsidies and exactions layd upon the subject, of the Realme, who have been, or shall bee so ready to conclude and impose that by parliament, as these who are made and set up for that and the like service. And whatsoever become of the poore tenents and labourers by land or sea, they shall bee ever winners by that block and butie.
Then to conclude, seeing this Bishoprie, as wee have clearly and evidently shown and verified, is against the written word of God,

against the Canons of the ancient kirk, against the ancient Fathers and Doctors of the kirk, against the iudgement of all the found moderne divines and reformed kirkes in Europe, against the doctrine of the kirk of Scotland preached these 46 yeares, against the confession of faith subscrived and sworne by the King and whole body of the Realme, against the constitutions of the kirk of Scotland in her assemblies, against the lawes of the realme, against the honour of God and his Christ, against the honour and weale of the king, against the honour and weale of the realme, against the constitute and setled estate of the Kirk and kingdome, against the honour and weale of the noble estates in Parliament. And finally against the weale of all good Scottishmen in soule, body and goods: Our earnest request and exhortation is, with all humilitie, submisse and reverend duetie to his most excellent Maiesty, and most ancient and noble estates of this present parliamen^; that as they tender the glory of God, the honour of his Christ, the peaceable and flourishing estate of Kirk and Commonweale, the welfare and honour of your selves, and the weale and good of all estates and subiects of this realme committed by God to their government an protection, that they erect not of new that unlawful and most pernitious estate of Bishops But on the co^trarie, that it would please his Highnesse with advice of his estates in this present Parliament, to ratifie againe of new the established goverment and discipline of the Kirke, and confirme the cautions made in generall Assemblies, namely, where his Maiestie was present to save the Kirke and Realme from the most pestilent corruptions of that false Bishoprie that these fearfull dangers and inconveniences being thus prevented, the blessing of grace, peace and glory may be continued and multiplied upon the kings most excellent Maiestie, his most honourable estates, and whole realme, and the Kirk and kingdome of Iesus Christ may flourish in all quietnes with holines and truth. Amen.

Archip.
Let others glory in their audacious conscience, as there will ever be a Hiel found to reedifie Iericho, although he know that it will cost him and his never so deare: for my selfe, I had rather in the basest estate abide the bensall of all episcopall authoritie without, then the forcible contradiction of these reasons within, set vpon the highest top of their ambition; especially if the rest of the steppes bee answerable to the first. Wearie not to goe through them with me: And now shew me which was the second.

It is easier for me to tell you now, then it was for them to determine at that time, when their preferment was so odious to the whole body of the ministerie: yet it was seen at last that

Invasio perpetuae dictaturae was vi^ ad imperium,Second step of prelacie, Perpetuall moderation and therfore let them first be constant moderators, which was wrought by this engine: First, summa papaverum capita demetendi: for in the yeare 1606, when this course was in hand, the ministers and rulers of the kirk, who stood in their watch, were dissipate, many were drawne out of the Countrey, and after that they were long detained at Court for the modest cariage of single ministers in a matter proper for civill and ecclesiasticall jurisdiction, as was the convention at Aberdein; Some of them as Athanasius like Andrew Melvill, and Hilarius like Iames Melvill, haue died in exile, others were permitted to returne but with restraint. Of the rest remaining at home, albeit some stand to this day in their owne stedfastnesse, yet a great part wanting their former encouragement, and loving the world, were moved to leaue their long continued opposition.Linlithgow Assembly. 2 In the time of that absence and dissipation for advancing the Prelats to this second step of dignitie, there is appointed at Linlithgow, December 12 a convention in profession preparatorie for a generall Assembly, but keeped like a generall assembly, albeit inspired with another spirit, consisting of Noble men, Statesmen, and such ministers, as were readiest to take and give. 3. It was pretended that the cause of the weaknesse of the kirk against the Papists, was the appearance of the division in the ministerie and alienation of his maiesties minde from some ministers; And that the cause of this cause vvas, partly a feare of the subversion of the discipline and libertie of the Kirk, by removing of Sessions, Presbyteries, Provinciall and generall Assemblies by some of their owne brethren; vsurpation of vnlawfull Iurisdiction in their own persons, a griefe for the afflicted case of their well affected brethren. And vpon the other side, that the charge of the kirk government was committed to men who had not wisedome and experience for keeping the kirk in quietnesse. 4. For removing this cause upon the one side, there was a declaration made in such generall and ambiguous tearmes, as might both gull the simple, making them to conceiue that there was no change intended, and yet include their owne particular intention in case they should be examined afterward upon their own declaration. The words are: There is no purpose to subvert the Discipli^e of the Kirke of Scotland, but rather to augment and strengthen the same, so farre as it can serve for the weale of the Gospell, and restraint of vice. And (say the whole Bishops) it is not our intention to usurpe and exercise any tyrannous and vnlawfull Iurisdiction over our brethren, nor to engyre our selves in any way vnlawfully in the Kirk government, etc. But for removing the cause upon the other side, there was no declaration accepted, that the wisest and

most experienced men should be chosen thereafter; But the Bishops must be constant moderators, alwayes restrained by 13 severall cautions and bands, not unlike the caveats at Montrose; But that they play fast and loose in the end by casting to this provision: If either upon his maiesties advice and proposition to the assembly, or upon their owne supplication, the generall assembly be moved thereafter to grant them any relaxation of any of the cave^ts, which upon good reason might appeare to the sayd assembly to be over strait; that this their promis^ should make no derogation to their libertie; Even as a little before they professed their willingnes to dimit their benefices at the pleasure of the assembly, for taking away all offence from their brethren, but with proviso that his Ma^ consent and approbation be had thereto. Never a more pernitious and plausible assembly in this kirk, every one of the Prelats Vatinius-like preventing accusation by confession and protestation. And yet no intention but to bee perpetuat in their moderation, for atchieving that, which they all disclaimed in word.


Archip.
Was the applause so great that there was no opposition?


Epaph.
The opposition could not at the first be so great, as at the first step, by reason of the dissipation of the opponents, the professed qualitie of the convention, the faire pretexts, the great promises, etc. By some the plat was embraced as a barre of brasse to hold out Bishops, by others as a pathway to their preferment, as the event did proue. And many blinded before, did see immediatly after that convention, that the constant moderators were (as was sayd at that time) the little theeves entring at the narrow windowes, to make open the doores to the great theeves. In all the quarters of the countrey, great disputation of the power of Ecclesiasticall assemblies in choosing their owne mouth and moderator. I might produce the reasons that were penned at that time against this second step, but that vvere infinite, and the particulars were to some of the actors yet living intollerable.


Archip.
I have heard of your adversaries, that about these times there were faire offers made of conference and disputation for finall decision of all controverted matters, but that they failed ever on your side.


Epaph.
But the truth is, another generall assembly but of the new sort, consisting of Noble men, Statesmen, and many Ministers, was keeped at Linlithgow, Iuly 26, 1608, vvhere all the causes of the diseases of the kirk, vvhich vvere mightily then aggreged, are brought to two heads, one was the contempt and discredit of the kirk, and of her vvonted government; another most speciall cause was the distraction of the ministers arising upon diversitie

of affection and opinion: diversitie of affection vvas cured, or rather covered by a slender reconciliation made among so many as were present, and recommended to goe forward among the absents at home in their owne presbyteries with many protestations against the breakers of that new made unitie. Diversitie of opinion vvas put into the hands of a cannie commission composed of Bishops there professing the title and dignitie, and of certaine ministers of differing iudgment, vpon no better vvarrant then the election of that convention, to convene with his Maiesty then in England, or with such of the counsell as his highnes should appoynt, at such time and places as they shall be required by his Maiesty, and to treat reason and to consult upon all matters standing presently in controversie among the brethren anent the discipline of the kirk, and whatsoever they agree upon, to report to the next generall assembly.


Archip.
Why should that offer haue been refused?


Epaph.
Consider first that the one partie of that commission was present, and in case to do what seemed good in their own eye: the other absent, and for the most part discouraged by sinistrous reports to deale in controversies of that kind; no particular ground of the discipline of the kirk was there named to stand in difference, al was under allowed customes and constitutions of the kirk. If any particular diversly taken had stood in doubt to be searched and determined by brotherly reasoning, to what purpose should his Highnes or his Counsellors bee fashed with such affaires, or by vvhat loue and discretion should modest simple ministers be tempted in such matters to utter their minds before the splendor of awful authoritie, all vvhich were rather seen then latent in pediments of that pretended vnion: yet the meeting of the commissioners was appointed and keeped at Falkland the 4 of May 1609.


Archip.
Who was present then, and what vvas done?


Epaph.
The Earles of Dumbar and Wigtoun,Confere^ce at Falkland. and the Lords of Scone and Fentunbarnes, did convene as his Ma. commissioners, vvith 5 new Bishops, 2 vniversitie men, and 3 ministers for the one part; 9 ministers (the tenth being absent) for the other. After reading of the commission of the general assembly, his Ma. missiue, and M. Patrick Simson his excuse; his highnes commissioners urged a conference of 5 of either side, two of his Highnes co^missioners being present, vvhich break of co^mission was rather taken by the one party then granted by the other: for making way to reasoning, the ministers demanded, 1 what were the points of discipline under different opinions, 2 for the clearing of the qualitie of difference, that they would determine what could be sayd in proper sence to be in controversie, and what extra controversiam.

3. of those brethren alledged vnder diversitie of opinions, who vvere on the one side, and vvho on the other. 4. by what authoritie could that conference make the generall commission speciall, or call in question one poynt of discipline established by the kirk, and ratified by law and practise. Much time and talk being spent about these demands, and some boastings to dash the ministers being breathed out, but no cleare answer returned, two questions were confusedly cast in. 1 Whether the moderators of assemblies should bee constant or circular (as they tearmed it.) 2 Whether should the caveats be keeped or not. To the first, the assembly as Linlith how had already answered, namely that order taken for an Interim shall stand to the next generall assembly. To the second, that the caveats were acts of the generall assembly, such as they must stand unrepealed for a good use, viz. for restraining the corruptions of voters in parliament in name of the kirk, and in that respect no more to be called in question then any other act concerning that vote. But after divers assayes to draw the ministers in some breach of the established order, which they declined with all their might, the whole commissioners considering the generality of their commission, and being moved with other necessary respects continued their conference to the first tuesday of August that same 1609 yeare to be keeped at Striveling, willing every one of the sayd brethren to advise and consider gravely of the sayd questions, and to be ready to propone their mindes by word or writ, as they shall think fittest, etc.


Archip.
Yee haue put my mind to rest concerning that conference at Falkland: I pray you shew me what was done at Striveling; for I never heard of that meeting.


Epa.
The purpose chiefly intended in that assembly and conference to establish the Bishop in his evil grou^ded moderation, being in the mean time obtained, the diversitie of opinions still remained, and that diet permitetd to expire upon hope that the rest of the course in hand would go more easily in a Linlithgow-like assembly.


Archip.
What assembly mean ye; for their sagacitie seemeth now to be hot upon the sent.


Epaph.
Third step to Prelacie, High Commission.I meane the assembly of Glasgow. But I must tell you first, that now having great rents, and being called Lords and Bishops, albeit not in respect of office but benefice; being Lords of Parliament, Lords of Councell, Patrons of kirks, plotters of Ministers stipends, etc. They were armed at that time in Febru. 1610 with the transcendent power of high Commission; which being added unto their former wealth and worldly dignities, maketh the third step of their preferment; Ecce duo gladij; spiritualis ^om^ judicat omnia, ipse vero a nemine judicatur.
Archip. That is a great and terrible one: for they may now hold intrants at the dore, depriue them who are entred, or plague them with the hungry persecution, confine, vvard, imprisone; So that now I thinke they may mount as they please vvithout opposition; especially when the timorous know that never failing truth; Cui plus licet quam par est plus vult quam licet.


Epaph.
Hence was it,Fourth step of Prelacie Their power Ecclesiasticall. that vvith all diligence the Assembly of Glascow vvas prepared the same yeare 1610 to be holden Iune 8, for lifting them towards the top of the Ladder: that they might be no longer, tyranni fine titulo. In that more costly then profitable Assembly moderated by the Bishop, and made up of Cathnes, Orknay and other wares of that sort; the Assembly at Aberdeen is declared nul: the Bishops made Moderatours in every Diocesan Assembly, and either they or their deputies moderatour of the weekly meetings of the exercise: Ordination and deprivation of Ministers, visitation of Kirkes, excommunication and absolution of persons, presentations, and all pinned to their sleeues. And finally this easie conquest is made sure with this threefold cord. 1 Everie Minister at his entrie shall svvear obedience to his ordinarie: 2 No Minister, neither in preaching nor exercise shall speak against the Actes of this Assembly: 3 That the question of paritie or imparitie of Pastors be not touched in pulpit, both under the paine of deprivation.


Archipp.
The Actes of this Assemblie added unto the former, are like the a^e added to the decretum; of vvhich the old proverbe vvent, Ex quo decreto alae supervenerunt, id est, decreta in decretalia ab^erunt, omnia perpetuo in pejus ruisse. But I see not how in all these proceedings they haue received any thing of that vvhich they call the office of a Bishop, except the Benefice and povver aboue single Presbyters.


Epaph.
Three of the number vvent to England at their owne hand, vvithout knowledge either of the Kirk,Fift step, Consecration. or of their owne Glascow Assemblie, and there received Consecration, the first step of their Hierarchie, vvhich after their returne they communicate to their associates. And last of all for setting them upon the top of the mast, vvhere they are yet fast a sleep: and for conclusion of this Perthian plot of questions, articles and vvhole building rising therupon,Sixt step, their Confirmation in Parliament. the Parliament holden at Edinburgh Iune 28 1617 enacted tvvo severall Statutes, one anent the Election of Archbishops and Bishops: another anent the restitution of Chapters.


Archipp.
I haue often heard of the Protestators and protestation at that time. As ye gaue me great satisfaction by that graue and vvell backed protestation, vvhich marred the musicke of their

first note at Perth, so I desire to know what was done against the sixt note, and highest step at Edinburgh.


Epaph.
Perhaps yee haue seen maister Maxwells magisteriall maxims against the 53 Protestant preachers of Scotland. The truth is, the ministers present at that time to vvatch for the weale of the Kirk, being conveened vvith the Ministers of the town of Edinburgh, out of the consideration of present and imminent evils resolved upon this modest and generall forme of Protestation.

Most gracious and dread Soveraigne; Most Honourable Lords and remanent Commissioners of this present Parliament:Protestation given in ^o the Parliament 1617. We the Ministers of Christ his Evangell, being here conveened from all parts of this your Majesties Kingdom, doe in all submission and reverence intreat your Majestie and Honours patient and favourable hearing of this our reasonable and humble suppli^ation: And first it will please your Highnes and Honourable Estates presently conveened, be informed, that we are heere a number of the Ministers out of all the parts of this Kingdome, and that the B^shops haue protested since our comming to a great many of us, that nothing should be agreed upon nor consented to by the^ in this present Parliament, in matters concerning the holy Kirk, the discipline and order therof without our speciall knowledge and advise; affirming also that neither they nor we haue power of consent in any innovation or smallest change of the order of our Kirk established, without speciall advice and determination of the generall Assemblie, representing the bodie of the Kirk of the Kingdome had therunto. Wherupon we resting in securitie haue received now a suddaine report to our great astonishment, of an Article to passe in conclusion, and to receiue the force of a law in this present Parliame^t, deceruing and declaring that your Maj. with advice of the Archbishops, Bishops, and such a competent number of the Ministerie, as your Maj. out of your wisedome shall thinke expedient, shall in all time comming haue full power to advise and conclude in all matters decent for the externall policie of the Kirk, not repugnant to the word of God, and that such conclusions shall haue the strength and power of Ecclesiastical lawes. Wherin it will please your Maj. and Honourable Estates to heare our just greeues, and consider our reasonable desire; and not to put us your Maj. humble and loving subjects to that poore and simple point of protestation; which if remedie be not provided, we must be forced to use for the freedom of our Kirk, and discharge of our conscience.
Wee then first plead reformation and puritie in our Kirk, in doctrine, in ministration of the Sacraments, in discipline and all convenient order with the best reformed kirks in Europe; which may stand, and haue been acknowledged rather as a pattern to be followed of others, then that we should seeke our reformation from any, that never attained to that perfection, which in the mercie of God this long time bygone under your High, we haue enjoyed, and are able by reason to maintain the same.
Next we plead the libertie of our kirk, which by the Lawes of your Majesties Kingdome, and diverse Acts of Parliament given forth in favour of the same, is established with power of publick meetings and general Assemblies, and allowance to make such Canons and Constitutions, as may serue for the comely order and decencie of the same, all which by this conclusion to be taken, must be utterly overthrown.
Thirdly, we plead for the peace and tranquilitie of our Kirk, that being neerest the Divine and Apostolicke Institution, hath lived without schism or rentings in it selfe, and by introduction of any noveltie not orderly, nor as appertaines, may be miserablie rent and our peace broken.
Fourthly, we haue been at divers times sufficiently secured from all suspicions of innovation, as by your Maj. letter the list Winter sent down to this Countrie to take away all feare of any alteration, which might arise upon your Maj lovingly intended journey; which letter by your Maj. speciall will, and direction of the specials of your Highnes councell is elswhere intimated in our Pulpits. As also by that Proclamation given out the 26 day of September 1605, when rumors of an intended conformitie with the kirk of England was spread abroad. Wherin your Maj. sufficiently avoided all such suspicion: And the hearts of all honest men setled themselues in a confidence, that no such thing should be attempted.
These and many other reasons haue moved us, in all reverence by this our humble Supplication to intreat your Highnes, and Honourable Estates not to suffer the forenamed Article, nor any other prejudicall to our liberties formerly granted, to passe at this time to the griefe and prejudice of this poore Kirk; wherby the universall joy of thousands of this land, who rejoysed at your Maj happy arriving here shalbe turned to mourning: Wherin as we are earnest supplicants to God to inclyne your Maj. hart this way, as the most expedient for the honour of God and the weal of the subjects, so if we shall be frustrated of this our reasonable desire, Then doe we in all humilitie with that dutifull acknowledgment of our loyaltie to your Maj. as becomes, protest for our selues and al our brethren that shal adhear to our protestation, that as we are free of the same, so must we be forced rather to incur the censure of your Maj. law, the^ to admit or obtemper an impositio^ that shall not fall fro^ the kirk orderly convened, having power of the same.



Archipp.
The Ministers could say no lesse for defence of the liberties of the Kirk granted in former Parliaments; and for declaration of their present and purposed constancie.


Epaph.
Albeit a protestation be a forme of defence, forbidden to no person neither by the law of God, of nature, or of man, neverthelesse a heavy accusation and hard pursuit is intended against the Ministers of that protestation: and some of the^ for their stedfast standing to the liberty of the Kirk put to high extremitie: But as sundry of the subscrivers of the first protestation at Perth, through ambitio^ sought after the Prelacy, against which they then proteste^:

So a number of the first subscrivers of the second Protestation at Edinburgh, vvere charged to compei^e at Santandroes a few daies after, and through feare vvere moved at that time to repent themselues of their faithfull service done to the Kirk: and since haue practised and preached against their protestation, to their owne shame, the offence of their people, the sorrow of their deerest friends, advantage of the enemie, and no small hurt to the Kirk and cause of Religion.


Archipp.
I perceiue that yee haue ever been protesting, and they ever proceeding, till that the unitie, authoritie, and order of the Kirk are quite destroyed, and the externall vvorship of God left naked vvithout a guard, readie to be a pray to every enemie.


Epaph.
The bitter fruits of the former alteration caries secret seeds of the following defection;Bitter fruits of the three former degrees of defection. the one side partly by terrours and allurements, crosses and commodities, banishment and benefices is in number diminished; and partly by paines, feares and expenses vvearied and vveakned. Nec ultra pars sanior ea tempestate repugnare ausa, ^am quoquo modo rebus finem imponere cupiens, Nam quillibet audere atque agere facile era^ maximorum amicitia subnixis. The other, vvhat by revolters, and vvhat by Intrants daily increased and by svveet successe and frequent favours encouraged and made vvanton. Before that mysterie of Hierarchie was unvailed, distraction among the Ministers vvas judged to be the causes of the increase of superstition and Papistrie; the fyne pretence of so many Assemblies, but both the one and the other are as negligently passed as mightily increased since. What the Kirk of Christ hath lossed, as much hath Antichrist gained; he needs not to feare the fead of Discipline and Kirk Assemblies, nor the ancient unitie of vigilant Pastors, for by the Circaean cup of this mightie mutation the face of matters, and fashions of men are so metamorphosed, that perhaps you shall find, that he vvho loved you best and hated the adversaries and corrupters of Religion most, is changed quite from himselfe, and scarsly can ye know your old friend now walking in his new cut: our old one heart is now either heart and heart, or else no heart at all. We vvere vvont to close up our great controversies vvith heartie harmonie: now in common matters we hirsp like harp and harrovv. For libertie is slaverie; for mutuall honour, pride and contempt, the spirituall service of the Gospell is left for the affaires of this life, for Kirk Assemblies are Episcopall Courts for friends comfortlesse and against enemies awlesse. If there yee seek reason, yee shall haue vvill: and if you say Brother, my Lord smiles, and yet fretts at you as a Disciple of the old discipline, and a despiser of the new domination: for reasoning and graue deliberation in weightiest

matters you shall haue a dash of artificiall voting, like Alexanders sword upon Gordius knot. yea in a point of Religion if they cannot perswade you, they vvill surely usurpe over your conscience. Papistrie, blasphemie, brea^h of the Saboath, contempt of the Gospell, mocking add puritanizing of faithfull Ministers, and reformed professors are rather passed as a merriment, or praysed by a smile, then repressed and punished as crying transgressions: he that refraines makes himselfe a prey, and he that will not follow the droue like the beasts of the field is the proud mans earth vvherupon he trampes, and must haue readie shoulders for a load of injuries; and if he be not servile in imitation, like waxe to perswasions, and witty to vvrong himselfe, he must learn to bear contentment and extremities in one minde. Thus Christ tryeth his own Kirk; Antichrist hath escaped vvith his crueltie and treacherie, and hath gotten as many yeares of peace to prepare his last onset by subtiltie, as the Kirk hath of troubles to make her preparations against his battels. He is shamelesse and insolent in his strength as he apprehends that he is not affrayed to exsult with the cryes of victorie before the battell: And notwithstanding of his incurable crueltie, some of the Pastors and professors of Reliligion, by banishments, imprisonements, confinings, fear of pursute, reproaches, calumnies, and all sort of contempt are so extenuate, that the pitie of their case is no lesse pearcing, then their faithfull labours in the Ministerie haue been profitable: Others so drunken vvith the deceiueable favours of the time, that their care to bee great eateth up their paines to doe good. And if there be a third sort free of fear and folly, and zealous in Religion, their hearts are pulled down to behold the miseries of poor men, vvho faine vvould doe vvell, but are wickedly abused, and the pride of idle men, vvho pay the debt of their calling by their nodd of Conformity to be admired, as the Prophets of Ierusalem and the pillars of the Kirk.


Archipp.
Your just complaints of the former alteration, albeit there were no vvorse to follow, doe cry, that it is more then time that the strong men set up, and sitting on high, Vt os Iehovae should set themselues to seek the Lord, and say to their brethren, Come neere we pray you to us; Let us seek the God of our fathers and the ancient way of our peace. We haue fallen out, but let there ^ee no more strife between you and us: We are brethren and debters to God and his people that we should earnestly contend for the maintenance of the faith once given to the Saints. Wherefore were we borne to see the destruction of our people and the destruction of our holy Citie, and thus to fit still, till it be delivered into the hands of strangers, to bee devored by the sword of sworn enemies, that as her glorie had been great,

so might her dishonour and her excellencie be turned into sorrow. Let us be zealous of the Law, and giue our liues for the covenant of our fathers, for by it we shall obtaine glorie.


Epaph.
Yet the verie teares of Gods people for the common miseries of the Kirk will feed the furie of such incendiares, as make their own particulars their highest projects: The wicked will still doe wickedly. As the Bishops of Rome after their advancement were not satisfied vvith the two uncouth Tragedies of Bellum sacrum and Bellum Pontificium, wherewith they filled the would with bloud, and troad all secular powers under their feet: but must also, vvhich is vvorse, depraue Gods worship, and in place of the Ordinances of Christ establish their own Traditions, vvherein they proceeded so farre, till they came to the manifest contradiction of Christs own legacie in the Sacrament, by that horrible clause of Non obstante expressed in their act, Notwithstanding that Christ institute etc. So our Prelats after their preferment, not resting content with the destruction of the unitie, authoritie and order of the Kirk, nor with their precedencie before the Peeres of the Kingdome, and power over all the subjects, must make an on set upon the vvorship of God, esteemed the substantiall and fundamentall part of our profession; so long as the other vvhich vvas called the circumstantiall part was in question: but now being once controverted, judged as indifferent and alterable as the other was before; and being inspired with the sprit of Desolation by promises and threatnings working in their soules, feare of losse, faith, hope, and loue of worldly commoditie, in stead of Theologicall vertues, they resolue to proceed in the course of defection till they haue come in effect to the clause Non obstante in the Sacrament, Notwithstanding the institution and example of Christ.


Archipp.
Yee haue brought me to the fourth maine degree of defection concerning the vvorship of God,Fourth degree of defection in the worship of God. wherein I vvould see the severall steps, and upon what part the first assault vvas made.


Epaph.
Neither they, nor I can tell vvhere they vvill ariue, but resoluing to try a stormie sea in despite of shipwrack, for better sport to the Papists, for further disgrace to the reformation of Religion, for loosing all, and for the more casi^ fishing in troubled waters, The famous Confession of Faith vvell known and commended at home and abroad, the formes of prayer publickly used in the Congregations and Families of Scotland, must be cast in a new mould;Aberdeen Assembly. But by some providence these new faces haue been kept close since the generall Assemblie holden at Aberdeen, the 13 day of August 1616; vvhere some opposition being made to that needlesse and hurtfull change, and to the formes

there presented, they vvere set over to further deliberation, but of such a commission, vvhose designes vvhen time requires will finde favour to speed vvel.


Archipp.
But I heare no mention of the fiue Articles in that Assembly.


Epaph.
Albeit it vvas layd to the charge of the Prelats, that it was high time for them to render the fruits of the paines and charges bestowed upon their exaltation etc. which the clerke vvas forbidden to reade. And albeit lineaments vvere drawn for Confirmation, and for holy daies, by enjoyning the Communion at Pash; yet the proceedings of that Assemblie gaue greater provocation then contentment: As the recantations of some Subscrivers of the protestation at Edinburgh, and the dissipation of the rest, like the stragglers of an armie put to the rout, through rigorous censure of others, who proved constant, gaue greater hope then distrust of better speed: And therefore unto a naked handfull sick of feare and suspicions, the fiue Articles vvere offered, vvhich vvere likely to draw down the Sacraments and the Saboath from their honourable estimation, as the 13 Articles of Perth vvere powerfull to divide the Ministerie, cassire the Assemblies, and nullifie the vvhole Iurisdiction and libertie of the Kirk.Assemblie at Santandroes. The peeping answer returned to the first motion of these Articles giving hope to prevaile, drawes on vvith posthast a generall Assembly to bee kept at Santandroes the 25 of November 1617: Where the said Articles were in a sort proponed, but neither considered in themselues as points of divinity, true or false, erronious or orthodoxe; nor how they might stand in our reformation vvithout infamie of our profession, and scandall of our professors. By reason of the shortnesse of time, suddaine convening of the Assemblie, and absence of six vvhole Dioces besides the Commissioners and best enformed sort of sundry Presbyteries, matters were remitted to further diligence, rather then any thing perfectly concluded.


Archipp.
Had the diligence bene used and paines taken at that time before the conclusion of Articles vvhich hath been aboundant since, they might haue been perhaps holden off, and the Kirk yet free of their fasherie.


Epaph.
But the masters of that credite gaue forth that after that Assemblie the Kirk would never be favoured in our daies with liberty to meet again in a generall: which as it vvas a prettie pollicie, speaking fully of the dischage of the ancient Generall Assemblies, but lisping for one of the new edition; so was it a meane to make the credulous Ministers inclining to peace rather then contentious disputation, the more secure and lesse carefull

to search the good and evill, and to see the course of that plot dressed up to fined articles. In the meane time they are surprised with the suddaine proclamation of a Convention to be holden at Perth August 25 1618.Perth Assembly.


Archipp.
Albeit I haue heard and reade much of that Meeting, yet I desire to heare your observation concerning the principall Actors, the proceeding and conclusion thereof.


Epaph.
The meeting vvas more then ordinarie, made up of Noblemen, Statesmen, Barons and Burgesses powed out for the purpose, vvith the splendor of their greatnesse to dash and deface such simple and modest Ministers and Commissioners as were loath to admit any noveltie in the vvorship of God, wherof they vvere not fully perswaded in their own mind. Amongst the deliberate and mightie in those purposes vvere to be found, some, it may be, taking that golden occasion to remember the proceedings of the Kirk of old against superstition and proud attempts, as injuries done against them or some of their neere and deere friends; some to shew their resolution to please, in despite of whatsoever to be said or done; some began to practise those Articles before they went to Perth, but vvith as great griefe to their own flocks as they little regarded to off^nd^th (...): and many so their own friends, and set for their own particulars, that they vvere led rather vvith hopes of gaine and pleasure for themselues then vvith Religion for Religion. In big vvords the co^mon cause vvas professed of all; but the^e was more heat in the pursute of what vvas liked, then patience to consult with reason anent the bringing again into the practise of Gods worship of certain ceremonies advisedly cast forth, and happily holden without, for the space of many by gone yeares. In the proceedings, how violently matters vvere carried, God, the conscience of the mightie and vvise, and such indifferent beholders as vvere present, are vvitnesses. The particulars are to be seen in the nullitie and antinullitie of that Assemblie so much tossed betwixt an adversarie to Novellists, and the advocate of Novelties, in the answer to gentle Iohn Mitch^lsones pol^mickes and other Treatises of that subject In end, although costly vvits projected that course, yet so strait vvas the vvay to conclusion, that the pleasing of superiour powers was pretended with promise never to urge obedience: no censure durst be touched against Contraveners nor Statutes made against the golden rule, Try all things, and keep that which is good: a soveraigne preservatiue against defection, and a deadly dittae against Ecebolius.


Archipp.
Such a conclusion made by such persons upon such proceedings is no strange thing; But obedience unto a conclusion

of that qualitie against so many bands of conscience, and so long practise, seemeth a matter more strange.


Epaph.
Ye cannot be ignorant what the obedience and what the opposition, was, for the space of three yeares after; notwithstanding of so many assayes to bring on the practise, till at last in the Parliament holden at Edinburgh in the m^neth of August 1621, there is a law made for the ratification of the fiue Articles; but without the sting of compulsion, and as free of penaltie as the constitution of Perth meeting was voyd of sanction and censure. What civill obedience shall be given to that Ecclesiasticall constitution for respect to the law, time will proue, and they know best, who resolue to bee Christians according to the act of Parliament.





THE COURSE OF CONFORMITIE, AS IT IS CONCLUDED in the last Parliament, Anno 1621.

Archippus.
Second demand concerning the parliament.YOV are now vvhere I would haue you, and vvhere my second demand proponed in the beginning, desired to bring you. As ye haue led me through a long labyrinth, and many secret vvayes of defection, to the beginning of that parliament; so I beseech you wearie not to lead me to the end thereof, that I may know what I am bound to do by vertue of that act, in the presence of God: for according to his acts I desire to be professor and pastor both.


Epaph.
Satisfied in ^ particulars.Remembring for preface my premonition in the beginning, I will first shew you the introduction to the Parliament, concerning certaine preparations for dressing the five articles for the parliament, and the Parliament for them. Secondly the, parliamentarie proceedings, and paines taken in time of Parliament for their ratification, untill the inacting of the statute it selfe. Thirdly, some memorable and rate events falling forth at that time by his providence, vvho beholdeth from heauen the actions of men;1. Preparation for the parliament. Qui aduersus multos bellu^ gerunt, eos superare possun^ quamu^s vi^ibus inferiores su^, si modo sust^in^^^ que^^ (...) m^m impetum. and at extraordinary times leaves not himselfe vvithout an extraordinary vvitnesse.


Archip.
The delay of time vvas an introduction of it selfe according to the Florentines policie. The first brash of a multitude is ever strongest, and time vvorketh. But vvhat were the particular preparations?


Epaph.
After their conception and pressing towards the wombe at Aberdein, Saintandrowes, and before, their birth followed at Perth, and begat some lovers. Afterward they gat the favourable names of the kings service and conformitie; and vvere carefully fostered by a rumour that the learned and wise of the land is for them, that the people would gladly embrace them, and to them

vvas tied all peace and quietnes.Multi percutiunt ut grandines, pot^nt^^ ut sulmina.


Archip.
That had been a strong argument indeed in the schoole of common-wits, if it vvould goe on this forme. Our fathers did it, our Princes gave us leaue, and our Prophets defended it.


Epaph.
But this yong conformitie vvanting such authoritie, came little speed at Presbyteries and Paroches. Her cause then was pleaded first in the court of Facilitie. The Bishops did convene their Synodals, and there the blast of conformitie vvas raised with all inforcements of terror; And of the fearfull sort of Gedeons army, some were moved to promise at least the practise of conformitie contrary to their own vote at Perth, and others mistaken in their modest silence, as consenting to the course. Next, in the transcendent court of Extremitie, the high commission did convene, and as it pleased them to make choyce, faithfull pastors vvere drawn before them; and contrary to all order and law of this kirk and kingdome, summarily silenced and confined. By these preparatorie assayes many were induced to call evill good, by speaking for it, by not speaking against it, by defending it as they were doers of it; and a busie sort defending it in others which as yet they had not done themselves. By such proceedings scandall and confusion vvere mightily increased, The people did run from novelties at home to seek the sacrament, where they might haue it according to the old forme. And although for covering this deformitie, and drawing the ministers to the course intended, it was openly given out, that it was never meaned, that the people should be compelled to alt^r that forme received and confirmed by law and long practise: yet so pregnant and piercing were these new formes, that many moe suspected some hard event of these varied policies, then were throvghly persuaded to change their profession; But some readier way was found out to make disciples of some Noble men and Borrowes, the earth vvas compassed, and sundry were made but upon sensible cost. When it was perceived to bee hard and difficile to get place for these strange novelties in the worship of God, and in the paroches of this kingdome, without more helpe of the secular arme, the leaders of that imployment after great stormes grew calme for a Parliament.


Archip.
But how was the matter brought to a Parliament?


Epaph.
The skill vvas to catch a fit opportunitie,Ad res geren das semper temporum occasiones expectare intucriq. oportere. Machiavel. and a strong occasion vvas offered by the seeking of a voluntarie supply for the afflicted state of Bohemia; vvhen the Nobilitie and others were assembled for that busines, it was resolved, that the generall contribution of the Lieges would bee more honourable for the countrey, and fitting for that worthy cause, and for presenting their overture, choyce was made of the Bishop of Saintandrowes, who

went to Court in the midst of a winter storme, and persuaded the refusall of the voluntary contribution, and delay for a time to bee good service. And having obtained libertie for holding a Parliament, came speedily home againe with greater ioy to such as sent him, then appearance of timous ayd to the state distressed.


Archip.
That was too strike under cover a Bastinado de bombaso.


Epaph.
After that the deeps betwixt the two rockes of highest displeasure and popular indignation were tried; the peoples disposition and opinion sounded they greedily grip the wished oportunitie of that charitable supply so vniversally liked: finally, all m^ane, and men being fervently disposed, set on edge and in readines and prom^ses passed for hope of good successe in this principall earthly desire. This parliament so long delayed, and as long desired, with all solemnities of state is proclaimed at the market crosse of Edinburgh.


Archip.
You are now drawing towards the second poynt, which I ^annot well take vp, except ye give me the tenor of the proclamation as best expressing the causes of that honorable meeting.


Epaph.
Left you or I either should be mistaken, behold the true copie thereof.




Proclamation of the Parliament.

IAMES by the grace of God, King of great Britaine, France and Ireland, defender of the faith.

Forasmuch as we know ^^^ll, that the happinesse, strength and glory of a Monarchy free from tyranny and confusion, is builded upon the mutuall loue betwixt the king and his subiects, expressed by the one in a fatherly care to maintaine his countries in a secure peace, flourishing with religion and iustice, and by the others in a loyall and submiss^e obedience to their Princes will and commandement, accompanied with a heartie and affectioned offering of all supply and ayd to the vpholding and increase of his estate and honour with their goods and bodies. Which reciprocall bonds (as layd in by nature and birth upon king and people) albeit no new contract can tie or shike off, yet are they with solemnitie in a sort renewed at the Assemblies of Parliaments, wherein the subiects according to the occurrent necessities of the Princes affaires, offer to him their best supply and helpe, and hee returneth to them satisfaction and ease of their just grievances, pardons for transgression of the lawes, ratifications and acts in favours of particular persons, estates, and corporations, with the establishment of such new lawes as the time doth require. And wee having now appointed a Parliament in our kingdome of Scotland to be holden and begin vpon the first day of Iune next, wherein as the importance and necessitie of our ado^s giv^th ^s just hope for to looke for a supply to bee granted to us by our su^jects in our sayd kingdome in a greater measure then hath been at any time heretofore, So are we most willing, that they should haue all contentment in having either generall lawes or particular

acts authorized by our royall consent, which being ripely advised, shall bee found expedient to passe. But because our long experience hath taught us, how that divers persons partly by ignorance, and partly by fraud, are accustomed, presuming upon the short time of the sitting of our Parliament, to giue in many ^illes and articles to those, who are appointed to sit upon the same, conteining matter preiudiciall to our crowne, or other our good subiects, which shortnes of time, and multitude of businesse permitteth not to be so narrowly examined, as need were. And for this cause we haue appointed a certaine number of our counsell to meet some dayes before the sayd parliament, and to consider of all billes, petitions and articles, which shall be exhibit to them by our Clerk of Register. Therefore our will and pleasure is, that all such, at intend to giue in any articles to be past in this approching Parliament, deliver the same to our Clerk of Register before the twentie day of May next, Otherwise the same shall not bee receiued, read, nor voted in our sayd parliament, except the same be past under our own hand. And that yee make publication hereof at the market crosse of our Burgh of Edinburgh, to the end that none of our subiects pretend ignorance.

Given at our palace at Westminster the 21 of Aprill 1621.

Was there no further done for convocation?


Epaph.
Missiue letters and precepts were directed according to the ordinary custome from his Maiesties Counsell, to all Noblemen of the land, Marquises, Earles, Vicounts, Lords, Barons, Commissioners of Shires, Bishops and Burrowes.


Archip.
I see not a word in the proclamation of the fiue Articles, and I see a fa^re occasion offered to the kirk or any of her members to give in their petitions according to their feares or desires.


Epaph.
The cover of the subsidie will not let you see them, grope rather, Videndi ficultas omnes attingit, attrectandi vero p^^^^s duntaxat, Machiavel. What was done in the petition yee shall see. The corporations of the kingdome in privat persons, as they had their publick or privat affaires to be done in Parliament, as they were wakened and warned by this occasion, according to their customable priviledges, appointed and kept their ordinary meetings, for preparing their petitions and articles to be timously presented according to the wil of the proclamation. But a necessarie corporation, and divers ministers and members thereof under great necessities and need of support from the compassion at hands of that high and honourable meeting, being deprived not onely of the ancient vigorous generall assembly, but of the weak image thereof, and in that respect of wonted order and Councell for preparing their desires, and authorizing commissioners to present the same, vvas left unrespected and desolate.



Archip.
Yet his Maiesties proclamation not onely permitting, but inviting, and the concurrence of so many weightie causes inforcing, as the great growth of corruptions, boldnesse of Papists, and increase of Pa^^stry rather plaistered then punished, and the distractions of the Kirke now turned into persecution of the Ministers, and grievous offen^e of the faithfull professors like a fire devouring and wasting all vnitie, order, and brotherly kindnesse, with no small danger to the state of religion, the ministers of dutie ought, and without wrong or offence to any, might haue presented their humble ^etion.


Epaph.
Chien o^ chaude ^a^t l^ causroide.Ye may guesse at the difficultie of that dutie by your owne disposition and retirednes at that time; yet it pleased the Lord to move the ministers in most quiet and peaceable maner to joyne their hearts and hands in this forme of supplication.




Supplication presented to the Parliament in name of the Kirk.
May it please your Honours in this present Parliament assembled under the high and excellent Maiestie of our deare and dread Soveraigne, to accept and consider the humble petition of your wearied and broken hearted Brethren, Ministers and people, obsieged under higher paines then ^^sse of life, libertie, goods and fame, for Sions sake not to hold their tongue, but to call and cry to the God of Heaven, and the gods of the earth, that peace may be within her walles, and prosperitie within her palaces.
ALthough it were more expedient to weepe then to say ought, when we see the Lords armie disordered, his companie broken, and in the chock betwixt Christian and Turke, Protestant and Papist, some of his worthies put from their places, and others turned, if not to the enemies campe, yet labouring for his cause. Neverthelesse having this happy occasion of his Highnesse fatherly care, providence, and inclination to distribute iustice and mercie among his Maiesties people, to whom by right pert^ines the worthy comforts and advantages, which the King of Kings hath inclosed in hi^ Royall scepter to bee delivered forth and disposed according to the occasions presented, and the reciprocall consideration in his Highnesse l^t proclamation expressed, as also of this high Court, and of your Honours compassionate intercession for our quietnesse and deliverance from injuries alreadie felt, and further feared, wee are even forced to speake, though not as Tertullus, or they who care not for the losse of much inward peace of their s^^le^ and consciences, so that they may gaine their supposed victorie. Yet holding our selves within the bounds of that Christian moderation, which followes God without iniurie done to any man, ^t is not beseeming our ministeriall calling to secret the

truth whereof wee are persuaded: and by a cowardly kinde of silence, and truthlesse modestie to betray a good cause. As touching our owne grievances, and others concerning our selues, wee haue locked up our hearts with patience, and our lippes with taciturnitie, rather then wee should impeshe your Honours at this time with our just complaints of wronged innocencie, by so many great repro^hes, shamelesse calumnies of sedition, disobedience, hypocrites, sectaries, etc. Deprivations and rigorous practises inflicted upon some, as if wee alone had troubled Israel, by holding for saith these principles, and maintaining these opinions, whereupon Sc^^smatickes and Puritanes build their heresies and despise better then themselves: and for no other causes knowne to us, but for our constant care, as God hath dealt to every man his measure of faith to build the house of God, according to the liuely paterne prescribed f^om his holy mountaine: our conformitie with the Kirk of Scotland and the best reformed kirkes of other Couatries, and our loyall obedience to hi^ Mai^sties lawes, declaring and approving the true Kirke, the true members and Ministers thereof, and the doctrine, sacrament and dis^ipline to bee ministred and professed within the same. As for the vehement outcries against our cause, and the sundry foule matters layd to our charge in word and writ, wee passe them all as swines flesh dressed after a divers f^sh^on; and wee looke for equall hearing at your Honours hands, and for Pauls libertie from King Agrippa: Thou art permitted to speake for thy selfe. In this confidence of our good cause, and persuasion of your Honours loue to the truth knowne ^y your selves, wee pr^esse not to offend any, but being provoked to d^pend our selve^, leaving to the Lord. Who shall iudge the qui^k and the dead, to persuade them that haue their eyes upon us unpa^tially to iudge our labours in the ministerie for the true religion, and against the enemies and adversaries therof, our harmlesse conversation and blamelesse a^ it pleases the Lord to assi^t us under our infirmities; The reasons whereby wee are uphol^en in our course and protestations, and iust defence against the oppositions intended, are all made patent to the eyes of the world, ^to wayes to lay open the nakednesse of our mother to the scandall of the enemie, or justly to offend any otherwayes minded; but that the multitude of our professors bee not tainted with the venome of malitiousnesse, contrary to the sincere milke which they haue receiued by a swift running spea^ of humane eloquence, more fitting to deceiue the eare, then to worke g^^e^ in the heart. If a c^sing ^^^e sor^orne, wee should des^^t from speaking. If the sword of pursuite were put up, wee could bee soone discharged of our ba^kler. But being pursued, if wee defend not, wee die with shame, and are guiltie of our owne ouerthrow.
The praise of all paines wisely taken, the steppe of all callings, and crowne of commendi^d s^fferings, is to doe and suffer in the causes of Christs spouse and for the maintenance of the salvation of our own soules, That one thing we cannot suppresse, our hearts desire to haue, and hold religion in libertie and puritie. And for that effect, better like of the single forme of policie in the Kirk of Scotland, and the reformed kirkes in other Countries; then the many Ceremonies retained by some. Yea loue and feare compelleth vs to put your Honours in minde, that as it hath been in all ages the holy disposition, and happy practise of all Gods people, to set continually before their eyes, his inestimable goodnesse towards his Kirke, her case and condition in her militarie troubles, and in consideration of the one and the other dutie, required and e^s^^cted at your (...), Where through in the riches of Gods mercie, they haue been safe from that dreadfull ruine that hath iustly overtaken the carelesse and the wicked, So now in time of dangerous dist^^ction it would please your Honours to set before your eyes, how wonderfully the Lords loue and with grace hath been powred upon his Kirk in this nation, and by the meanes of religion vpon our gracious Soveraigne, your Honours auncestors of blessed memorie, your selves, your friends, and upon this estate, the present estate of such a loving mother, crying in her bloody distresses for helpe at your hands, And in regard of blessings abundantly received in the dayes of her libertie and health, what is due from your son-like affections, places of credit, and honourable callings in your high conventions, where God stands in the assembly of Gods, high iudges among the Gods to your well deserving mother, in whose wombe wee were conceived, and brought up on her knees to the condition wherein we now stand at ease and peace in the dayes of her distresse. Our hurable petition to your Honours is, that as yee respect the glorie of Christs kingdome to be continued in this land, the adorning of his Maiesties crowne, and the quietnesse of his loving and loyall subiects, the endlesse prayse of your selves, and the flourishing of your Honourable estates with the particular comfort of so many ministers and congregations within this Realme. This poore Kirk in the day of her teares, griefe and feare, by your timous intercession at his Maiesties hands, (and the Lord give you favour in the presence of the King) and your uttermost indeavours debtfull to Gods honour, and Christs kirk in this happy occasion now presented, may obtaine in this parliament her most reasonable desires.
A sufficient and ready execution of former acts of Parliament made against the fearfull blasphemy of Gods name, profaning of the Lords day, and contempt of his: Sanctuarie and service so vniversally over-flowing in this land, not onely in the persons of poore ignorants,

in a manner tyed to these horrible crimes by a cursed custome and beggarly necessitie, but even in the more honourable sort, whose damnable example encourages their followers to sinne without fear, with such additions as may represse and restraine these crying abominations in all, without respect of persons.
A safe libertie to enjoy the profession of our Religion, as it is reformed in doctrine, Sacraments and discipline, and hath been openly professed, sworne and practised by Prince, Pastors, and people of all rankes; your predecessors of worthy memorie, your selues, and wee all yet living these threes^ore yeares bygone and aboue.
A full deliverance from, and a sufficient defence against all novations and novelties in doctrine, Sacraments and Discipline, and specially such, as by constitutions of the Kirk, confessions of faith, liberall Lawes of the Countrie, Oathes and Subscriptions, and long continued practise, hath been condemned and cast out, as idle rites and Romish formalties, under whatsoever pretence they plead for re-entrie.
That no Act passe in derogation or prejudice of the Actes alreadie granted in favour of reformation, libertie of Assemblies, convenient execution of Discipline etc. or for corroboration of new opinions against the same, whether Episcopacie, or ceremonies the shadow thereof, which for the peace of the Kirk by heavenly wisedome should be rejected rather then ratified.
That all Ministers that are removed from their Charges, be restored to their places, functions, and stipends.
The happines to liue under his Majestie and his Heires, ordinary Iudges, and Rulers appointed by lawes and custome, and established by the Actes of Parliament, that our cause be lawfully cognosced according to order and justice, before any sentence passe against our persons, places and estates: and not to be judged by any judicatorie forraigne, and not established by the Lawes of our Country.
We trust that as Abraham composed the variance betwixt his own and Lots servants, Moses interceded betwixt the Hebrews, and Constantine betwixt the Ministers of the Kirk: So the Lord shall giue you courage to intercede with his Majestie and his Highnesse fatherly disposition, to set the pillars of the earth that were shaken, and to take off the heavie burthens, the burthensome ceremonies, the burthensome censures, and the hurthenous abuses which many haue groaned under: And with a readie and royall hand to quench the beginning fire of deprivation of Ministers by Ministers, of hindring Gods substantiall worship by him commanded, and withdrawing from the people the appointed food of their soules, and necessarie meanes of their faith and salvation: of smiting of many a true shepheard, and committing the flocke to many Wolues and blind guides: of leaving the Papists cause, and suppressing

the best Ministers, whereby they get rest to mischeife the Kirk, and build up their own Synag gue and that for the sake of Ceremonies, no more necessarie for the s^^ use of Christ, then fai^ding for a chast ma^^on more readie to crosse the commandement of Christ, wherby we are charged to pray to the Lord of the Harvest, that he would thrust forth lab^rer into his Harvest, then for the edification of the body of Christ. Thus ^^mbly co^manding the innocencie of our selues petitioners, and our just right and possession of that reformation which we earnestly craue to be continued to your Honourable charitable judgement; We pray God for Christs sake to enable you to doe that, which may be acceptable to himself, profitable to his Kirk, and comfortable to your own soules, at that day when we must all appeare before the ^^dgement seat of Christ, that man may receiue the thing, which are done to his bodie, according to that hee hath done, whether it be good or ill: and to blesse his Ma^. and Royall issue with peace and truth for ever: And your Honours with sound Religion and loyaltie in this life, and endless^ glorie with Christ for ever.






Archipp.
The supplication seemeth so reasonable and religious that no man needed to be ashamed to present it, no man could refuse to accept it.


Epaph.
It was indeed presented by a faithfull Minister in name of the Kirk, and of his fellow Ministers, in all humility and after the prescribed order, to the hand appointed by Authority, and obliged by office to receiue petitions of that kind from any corporation, o^ ^^^e le^ge of this Kingdom. But after some refusals and sundry significations of unwillingnes, it was received at last, but subscribed by the Presenter, and with su h misregard of the messengers of God, and matters of his Kirk, that he pla nly prof^ssed his doubting, whether he vvould exhibit it in Parliament or not. Relegentem oportet esse religiosum nefas.


Archipp.
Notwithstanding all this diligence in proclamations, conventions, devising and presenting of petitions and supplications the Parliament was not holden then, but in August, what could be in doing in the two month^s interjected? For the estate of Bohome and the Pala^nate abroad cryed to hasten the subsidie for their present succour and safety: And the Parents of Perth Articles at home, longed to see the day when that birth of their braines should be perfected in a Parliament.


Epaph
Parliament continu^e.From the first of Iune, vvhich vvas the appointed day, the Parliament was continued to the twenty three of Iuly, upon what causes in so urgent a necessity upon the one part, and so earnest desire on the other, it belongeth to the search of stately wits. It is well known that the length of secret deliberation and shortnes of open determination is meetest for some matters. And as well known amongst us, that there vvas als great unwillingnesse to the

one cause, as affection to the other.Nihil mag^^ discriminis co^sihis tam inimicum quam celeritas.Qu c^uid est incoctum non expromunt, benecoctum duunt. But the pretext behoved to attend the intended purpose. And therefore, during this delay, great was the negotiation betwixt the rich Merchants of faire vvords and fine promises, and the hungry servants of lingring hope, who thought it now a fit time to draw up their particulars, and the principall cause in one bargaine, What will y^e giue me, etc. All these things etc. Everie wit that had a venal^ vote, thought at this Market to repaire his losses, to re-edifie his estate upon the ruines of the Kirk, and faire words made fooles faine. Our vigilant Bishops set themselues, and send forth their explorators and Brokers to try the inclinations of Noblemen, Commissioners of Shires, Barones and Burgesses: And as they were found affected, cold, hot or lukewarme, they vvere vvrought upon to bee present, absent, or to resolue vvisely against the day appointed, vvhereby many honest simple soules vvere put to a hard choice, either to perill Religion or to vvant promotion;No^ minus ego te spe, quam tu me vo^e tua delectasti. and so made many to vvrong themselues in forsaking the truth, vvhich vvas in their heart, for hopes, vvhich are never likely to fill their hand. Where the feare of the Leaders of the course vvas greatest, there, albeit vvith a dissembled secrecie greatest confidence vvas professed, by making it come to mens cares privily, that Perth Articles vvould certainly bee ratified, and therefore it vvas needlesse to oppone, vvhich vvent through the Countrie as a Proclamation of victorie to dash some, and as terrours of desperation to make others to crie, Our opposition will doe us evill, and the cause no good. And servile spirits to determine, where the mightie, and multitude are, there will wee bee. By this crooked policie the sillie simpli^itie of many professours rawly resolved to stand in the day of tryall vvas deluded. And Noblemen tempted to lurke in a diffi^ill time, easily obtained licence vvithout great triall of a just cause, as vvhose absence then presence vvas accounted better service.


Archipp.
When these two moneths of Preparation vvas thus past, and the purpose matured, vvhether vvas the appointed day observed.


Epaph.
As there vvere preparatorie years betwixt Perth Assembly and the Proclamation, and preparatorie moneths betwixt the moneths appointed in the Proclamation and the keeping of the Parliament; so also that the proportion may be fall, there were daies of preparation betwixt the day appointed and the riding of the Parliament.


Archipp.
Know ye vvhat vvas done in that last time of preparation immediatly going before the work it selfe.



Epaph.
Albeit it was not the first, it was not the last: After the long expected comming of his Majesties Commissioner Iames Marqueshe of Hammilton, vvho upon the 18 of Iulie, fiue daies before the appointed day of the Parliament, was accompanied vvith divers of the Nobilitie, and some of his own friends (but not so many as would haue vvaited on him vvillingly in a better errand) to Halyroodehouse his Majesties owne palace prepared royally for the Commissioner, according to the affection carried to the commission; a great part of the Nobilitie having feasted with him that night, upon the morne the 15 of Iulie, he had his first meeting in private with the Officers of Estate, and Plot-maisters of Perth Assembly, vvhere according to their loue to the conclusion and feare of impediments, all their heads were set on vvork for the fore-casting, preventing, or removing opposition and purchasing the victorie: Vpon the 20 day there was an universall Counsell meeting, vvhere all things for peaceable resorting to the Parliament were concluded, and the day destinate prorogated from Monday the 23 till Wednesday the 25, that they might yet once againe assay the foord, fill up holes, and remoue rolling stones before the riding.


Archip.
Ye tell me of great preparation against the Kirk upon worldly respects on the one side, but I heare of no diligence for the Kirk upon better considerations on the other: In that troublesome time of the vvorld so dangerous for Kirkes, Kingdomes and Common-weales, vvherein all vvits and hearts vvere aloft, and every minde of friend and foe, as he respected the publick estate or his own particular, vvas bended for his own intention: It seemes ye and others of credit in the Ministerie should not haue been negligent, but at least should haue backed your own supplication, and waited upon the occasions of doing good.


Epaph.
Not onely Noblemen, Comissioners of Shriefdomes, Bishops and Burrowes vvere present, but from all the quarters of the Countrie, according to the common libertie so many of the free Lieges of the land, as had to doe in that highest Court. And amongst them multitudes of Ministers, some to be idle beholders of the celebritie, others vvith greater desire of the ratification of their own erronious facilitie, then of the puritie of Gods worship and reformation of the Kirk, Papists of both sorts Iesuites and Dominicanes, vvise in their own generation: It had been a wonder then if there had not resorted thither a number of faithfull Ministers to doe their best Pastorall endevours for the liberty of the Kirk, and at least for manifesting to the after ages, that the truth vvas not altogether deserted to help to make up Catalogum Testium veritatis.



Archip.
Their interest was not meanest in the eyes of God, neither could that giue just offence to any person: his gracious Maj. never refused that libertie to any of his free subjects, nor to them at the last Parliament, vvhere he vvas present in proper person.


Epiph.
Yet my Lord Commissioner, by suggestion of his vvisest counsel, searching the safest vvay for successe, had learned that the presence of the Ministers might be verie prejudiciall to the ratification of Perth Articles; at least might be a powerfull mean to stay many from giving their consent to the making of such a Law: and therfore, by their advice he findeth it verie speedfull, that th^se Messengers of God be straitly charged and commanded by ope^ pro^lamation at the Market cross to passe out of the town of Edin.


Archip.
That seemeth to haue been but a boast for their more peaceable behaviour, or for preventing their dealing and suspected Protestation; they vvere not called, let be convinced of any fault, and therfore could not be punished vvith deprivation of that libertie, vvhich the verie law of nature yeeldeth, and vvas not denyed to the enemies of Religion and meanest of the subjects.


Epaph.
Yet upon tuesday the 24 of Iuly, the letters vvere execute against them allanerly, among all the subjects of the Kingdome. Onely there was joyned at the same instant a Proclamation for bringing in Allane Machonil Do^ chiefe of the Clanca^ron Laird of Lochaber known for a vvitch and sorcerer, and declared to be an infamous murtherer, a rebell and despiser of Authoritie: vvhereupon it vvas ordinarie in the mouthes of the people, that the Parliament could not end vvell, because at the beginning therof, they vvere banishing God and bringing in the devill. But perhaps ye vvill be as incredulous, as that Papist who feared his fellow professors in forrain parts should be, upon the report of that proceeding against the pastors of the Kirke; albeit your incredulitie and theirs arise upo^ diverse grounds. Ye think it too evil to be true: they will thinke it too good to be true: for one of the Papists in the time of the riding of the Parliament bursted out upon the open street into these words with great exultation; When I come to Rome and Avinjon to report how I haue heard the Ministers of Scotland discharged out of Edinburgh by open proclamation at the Market crosse in time of Parliament, the newes will be so joyfull, that scarsly will they bee beleeved by the Catholickes.


Archip.
All goeth wrong,Que v^^^ t^^r s^nchi^^^ luy met a rage su^. when they rejoyce vvho should be made to weep, and they do weep who should be made to rejoyce: with what colour of pretence could that uncouth proceeeding be plaistered.


Epaph.
He that would haue his dog fell'd will soon find a cudgel: One pretence vvas, their a sence from the charge of their flocks, wherof they are bound before God and man to be diligent Overseers.

God and the vvorld knowes, whether they who used this pretence are carefull of the fidelity of Ministers: whether they o^ the other sort who were permitted to stay, wait better upon their vocation: and whether it was not a principall point of their charge to attend at such a time, wherin such matters were to be handled, as could not but fall under their own and their peoples practise in the ordinarie worship of God. Another was a shew of mitigation in the and of the Proclamation, excepting so many of the Ministers as ^ight procure a warrant from a Bishop to stay still: that is to say (according to the Bishops own interpretation vvhen some craved leaue of t^e^ so many as would promise to make no interpellation, intercession private or publicke, nor protestation against their beloved articles, wherof they were so jealous. The third and sidest cloak was the twofold accusation of two brethren in the Ministerie, vvho vvere deceiued by the Counsell to be patternes of extremitie and preparatiues of terrour to the rest.


Archip.
What accusation meane yee, and of which Ministers?


Epaph.
One was of Mr. Andrew Duncan minister at Crail (but holden from the function of his Ministerie by the fine craft of a timorous te^porizer his cunning collegue, wrestling betwixt the wind of the world, (...) the waue of his conscience) for presenting the Supplication aboue written; who vvas sent for by the B. of S. androes, and detained by him in his lodging, till he delivered him to the Captain of the guard to be presented that same day afternoone before the Counsel, where compe^^ing he was accused by the Bishop upon his subscription of the supplication (albeit the B. had spoke^ nothing of that to him in private when he sent for him) and having acknowledged his hand writ, he declared his readines, at the command of the L. of Counsell, upon assignation of a competent time to produce his warrant of gr^at numbers of Preachers and Prof^ssors, in whose name he had subscribed; subjoyning, for stopping the mouth of his accuser that Cuivis private ^icet ^gere causam publicam: whereupon the B giues out this sentence, It is thought good ye be committed presently. But because the Defender pleaded the poor mans right: An non lic^^ ^uili et ^^otesta^i ^^mendicare, The Lords not seeing how th^y ^ould put^^^h him for such causes, and liking better the innocency of the defender then the iniquity of the accuser, thought ^eet to cal him in again where the B. Vt quae non prosunt singula mul^^ (...) ^ubent, first layd to his charge that he had preached in Crail the vveek before, which he confessed: That hee was his Ma^ rebel lying at the Horn; he denyed that he was ever at the Horn: That he had broken ward in Dundie: he answered that for obedience he had remained at Dundie the space of half a year upon double charges, ^^ing separate from his vvife and six children, the approaching

Winter made him to draw homeward, thinking that either they had forgot him or would pitty him after so long trouble. Like as he had received a letter from the B to be at Santand. at a meeting of some Brethren of the Ministers. In end he besought the L. not to imprisone him upon his own charge; and to consider that it vvere greater mercie to kill them vvith the bloudie sword, then to pine them to death vvith hunger. But his doom was dight before his co^peirance.


Archip.
What was the other accusation?


Epaph.
Mr. Alex. Simson minister at Drieburgh, not having any such intention, was earnestly desired by a brother serving in one of the ordinary places of the Ministers of Edin. to preach for him upon the Saboath, vvhich was the 22 of Iuly immediately going before the day appointed for holding the Parliament. Wherunto he was perswaded upon sufficient reasons alledged by his requester. He Preached upon Ezech. 3.16 according to his own custom and the present occassion, in the good old Scottish fashion,Ca^dide m^^^ and not after the new Laodicean forme, more plainly to all then pleasantly to some, and in greater simplicie of heart then vvisedome of words.(...). He spake against the manner of the entrie of many yong men into the holy calling of the Ministerie, against the negligence of watchmen, vvho because of the fear of men, of loue to the wages of iniquity, and their own guiltines of the same sin, are silent in censuring the sinnes of others, and especially against the defection of Bish. All which and much more spoken not in a corner, but in the publick audience of so great variety of hearers, as were in that town at that time, I need not record. Vpon the day next following he vvas called before the Counsell, and when he had confessed all that he had preached in publick: At last the former Minister and he vvere convoyed by the guard to the Cannongate, where they were forced to stay that night without libertie to goe to their own lodging pla^^: and upon the morne were led by three of the guard to the Castle of Dunbartane, vvhere they entered upon Thursday Iuly 26.


Archip.
I see not how the proclamation could passe with any probabilitie against the whole Ministerie, more upon this pretence then the first: for by vvhat propagation could their personall actions be derived to the rest.


Epaph.
Ye vvill know that best, and will be put out of all your doubts, when yee haue seene the Copie of the Proclamation itselfe in these vvords.





AT Halvroode-house 23 Iulie 1621.

Proclamation charging the Ministers to depart one of Edi^^.
Forasmuch as it is understood by the Lords of secret Counsell that some re^tlesse and busie persons of the Ministrie en^glecting the care and charge of their own Kirkes and flocks, over the which they are bound in conscience before God, and in duetie before men to be careful and diligent watchmen and Overseers

haue lately made their redresse to this Burrow of Edinburgh, where the Estates of the Kingdom in the soveraigne and high Court of Parliament are now assembled: and that some of their Ministers haue not onely engyred, and in a manner intruded themselues in the Pulpits thereof, without any lawfull warrant or calling, but in stead of wholesome doctrine for edification of the present Auditors, haue fallen out into most injurious and undutifull speeches against the sacred person of the Kings Maj labouring thereby, so far as in them lay, to possesse the hearts of the Auditors with some bad opinion and construction of his Maj. unspotted life and conversation. And not content herewith, th y haue their privie Conventicles and Meetings within this Burrow, haue obtruded themselues upon some of the Estates of Parliament, and in publick audience haue prejudged his Maj. most religious, sincere and lawfull proceedings, using sollicitations against his Maj. just intentions: And haue not onely directly manifestly and avouchedly done, vvhat in them lyes, to cal the sinceritie of his Maj. disposition towards the true Religion in question, but to incultate and fasten the same bad opinion into the hearts of his Maj good subjects, and so crosse and hinder all his Maj. proceedings in the Parliament, which hath no other ayme but the glorie of God, puritie of Religion, and weale of this Kingdome. In which three points, the bypast experience of his Maj. happie governement will cleare the sincerity of his Maj. most religious disposition towards the glorie of God, and weale of his people, and will vindicate his Majestie from the malignant aspersions of his Majesties undutifull subjects. And whereas this forme of doing in a Kingdome, where the puritie of Religion hath such a free and uncontrouled libertie and progresse, as it hath in this Kingdome under his Majesties most godly, wise, just, and happie governement, is not suffred nor allowed and hath no warrant of law, custome nor observation elsewhere, but may draw with it many dangerous consequences, and raise up emulation, and distastes betwixt his Majestie and his good people to their danger and harme. Therfore the Lords of secret Counsell ordaining letters to be direct to command and charge the whole Ministers presently being in this Burrow, except the ordinarie Ministers of the Burrow, and such others, vvho upon the notorietie of their lawfull adoes heer, shall procu^^ warrant from their Ordinarie, and failing of him from one of the Arch^ to remaine and abide still heer, by open Proclamation at the Market crosse of Edinb. to remoue and depart out of the said Borrow within 29 houres next after the said Charge: and that they onn^ wise presume to repair again thereunto during the time of this Parliament under pain of rebellion. And if they or any of them f^ile, the said space being bypast, to denounce etc. vvhich denunciation to be used at the Market crosse of Edinburgh shalbe as sufficient, as if it were used at the market crosse of the head Burro^ of the shire where they dwell: certifying them also that their denunciation they shall be taken, apprehended, warded and punished accordingly.







Archip.
That is more then ever I looked could haue proceeded from Christian authoritie professing the same reformed religion with us. It was a strong prognostick of great rigor against the persons of the Ministers, and of great preiudice to the cause of religion. What was the resolution of the Ministers?


Epaph.
They could not stay against the proclamation; they could not altogether desert the cause in so desperate a time. And therefore finding, that the commissioners of Shires were sent for; and earnestly desired to make knowne their grievances with faire promises of satisfaction, a strong preparation to purge the great matter of all opposition: and that after assayes there was no hope of recalling of the rigor denounced against them; for obedience first to God, and next to God unto his Maiestie: they resolved as followeth.

VVEE the Ministers of Iesus Christ in his Highnes kingdom of Scotland, being convened from the quarters of the Countrey to concurre for the weale of the Kirke, and according to the ancient custome thereof observed before in Parliaments, to consult upon weightie affaires, as the present case requireth consideration: and being charged at the market crosse of Edinburgh to remoue forth of the sayd Borrow within 29 houres immediatly following the sayd charge: as also justly fearing harder sequells to follow upon such beginnings, haue concluded according to the necessitie layd upon us, to haue our informations and admonitions to the honorable Lords of Parliament, attesting them in the name of our Lord Iesus, to remember the labours and sufferings of their honorable predecessors: and to doe in the matters in hand, as they would be accepted at his glorious appearance: and praying to the Father of lights, to open their eyes, and to incline their hearts to try things that differ and approue things expedient.



Archip.
Informations and admonitions good for them, cannot be evill for me and others: and who knoweth if being represented to them after so many sensible confirmations from heaven and earth, they consider of them more advisedly and unpartially: and so many as haue lost their first loue, remember from whence they are fallen, and doe their first workes.


Epaph.
Some preposterously iudge of all reasons by the conclusion, and not of the conclusion by the reasons:(...). others are so obstinatly set against al persuasion, that Ne si persuaseris, persuadebis. And a third sort close their eyes and ears against all information: they fear that the light of their minde prejudge their affection: and they be made to beleeve that for true, which they wish were false: yet both for their sakes whose repentance wee are seeking, and for your owne and others whom we would confirme, behold some of the many then left behind us.





Reasons left by the ministerie to the members of parliament.
YOur Honors assembled in this present Parliament, ought to absta^^ s^^ ratification and all corroboration whatsoever of Per^h Assembly, and Actes thereof, for the reasons following, and many moe alleaged, and to be produced, if your great adoes could permit.
1 It is but an assembly single, and in it selfe diuided. 2. in forme of proceeding not on^ly different from others, but directly against the order establish^d by the kirk. 3. In effect contrarious to all generall and provin^iall Assemblie, P^^sbyter^es, and Sessions, as they are institute, and have been h^l^^ in Scotland since reformation of religion within the same. 4. The carried s ntence and actes thereof are repugnant to the forme of religion retrived, beloved, professed, established, and defended by this kirke, and whole body of this Realme, by your Honorable predecessors of worthy memorie, and your selues: and practised vniversally and in the severall paroches of this kingdome these sixtie yeares and aboue. Non est a consuetudine recedendum sacise nisi rationi adversetur; much lesse from a known truth directed and blessed by God in such abundance of benefits as the lend hath enioyed with religion No kirk Protestant nor Lutherane, nor of other profession, Papist, or whosoever wil go in a change without some evident (at least apparant) reason of the word. The change but of the old Calendar for the Popes new one (and that is but a small thing made a great hurly burly both at Rig^m Livonia, and at Augusta.
2 Such ratification should crosse and directly preiudice the acts of Parliament 1592 and the provision expressed in the end of the act of Parliament, 1^97 And all other acts set downe in favour of the iurisdiction of the kirk, libertie thereof, assemblies, and discipline. Item, his Maiesties proclamation published and printed at command of his Counsel 1605. Item, the protestation made at Perth, 1606, and all others made before and since. Item, the covenant made by the ministers and professors of this kingdome, 1596 and 1597, and all other bands, whereby Pastors and flockes haue obl^shed themselves in persons and continuall practise to stand to the forme of religion received and practised, Tales legum mutationes would proue legum vulnera. Quae in suo statu, eademque manent etsi deteriora sunt, tamen vtiliora sunt. Reipub. quam quae per renovationem vel meliora inducuntur. And with what credit and constancie could your Honors confirm separation from your fathers, and the break of ancient vnitie and conformitie with your own kirk, when it may be truely sayd. Melius atque rectius olim provisum, and quae convertuntur, in deterius murantur.
3 The reformers of this kirk, and such as by a long continuance follow them, said a sure foundation and builded upon the same without errour, notwith^tanding of diffi^ile times; It were our wisdome to go forward and not ha^k^^rd, to strengthen and not to weaken. David left not the (...) where Saul left it, nor Salomon where David. If our fathers were in the way, our change is errour and out of the way: And shall we say now, th^^

our sound and ancient profession is priscus rigor, cui jam pares non sunt homines. Constantines course was more commendable, Perfecit Constantinus quod Philippus jam caeperat. It were our dutie, if our forebeears had done wrong to practise the rule, Quae illicita a Praedecessoribus invenitintur admissa, in melius revocari oportet.
4 Observation of dayes, kneeling, etc. as they are straitly enioyned, are voyd of the necessarie properties required by the wisest fathers in a lawfull ceremony, ut fidei congruat, saluti proficiat, disciplinae conducat, So in this kirk neither are they necessary, expedient, nor sitting the frame of our reformation; they edifie not, they divide and destroy, in so far as ceremonies being testes religionis, they are signes to the adversaries of the truth, that we repent our reformation, which is not, and presages to returne to their damned corruptions, which by the grace of God wee meane not in substance or ceremony. To reinduce them, say the divines of Germany, is to disturbe the peace of the kirk, to grieve the godly, to wound the weak, to countenance Poperie, by shew of inclination towards it, or commoderation with it In neighbour kirks, where they most prevaile, their removall is most earnestly sought.
5 In Perth assembly they are concluded not as lawes binding either to fault or pain, but as admonitions or institutions. Magnum est discrimen inter ecclesiastica decreta and politica, quorum necesse est illa minus obstringere conscientias. Nam in ecclesiasticis spectanda est (...). In politicis aute^ parendu^ est, quamvis tu eam eutaxiam non videas. Such ceremonies are juris privari non publici. Ilk man is bound in conscience by the word first to discern what is indifferent, and then to direct himself in the right vse of every individuall thing for his own edification: And if ministers and professors be restrained from that search, and brought under a compelled obedience by the law, that were to revive the ancient servitude of the Germanie Adiaphorisme, wherewith the godly would never suffer themselves to be intangled. Nulla lex sibi solam conscientiam justitiae suae debet, sed ijs a quibus obsequium exspectat.
6 Our forebears finding the contro^^ted ceremonies to be the monse^ebs of Popery, and like the mowdiworts in Thessaly, that overthe^ a whol to^ne, Quod in Papatu dolendum, in reformatione auferendum ^uta^ent, They not onely took away Beal, but the calves of Dan and Be^hel. They thought it no wayes meet to follow Pilats policie to please the Iewes with scourging of Christ, that they might keep him aliue. And will the Papist be pleased with scourging the doctrine by invoctions, etc. And taking againe some of these ceremonies, will that preserve us against their heat breathed out against us as heretikes, and make us lurke under mitigation, as if we were now but schismatikes. Non est ad hunc modum in religione agendum, (sayth one) tota enim repurganda est and ad vivum emendanda And another sayth: Atqui praestaret s^ pultam esse doctrinam ad tempus, quam sic slagellari.
Jt is to be feared, that before it be long, that men disaffected to the ancient order, shall further presume ere it be long, to giue out other doctrine as well as new ceremonies.
7 Ratification would compasse a great many Ministers and professors of this Kirk between two dangerous straits; either to practise against the truth, as they vnderstand it, and haue walked in it, and against the personall band, whereby they haue oblished themselues to stand constantly to the obedience of it, or else to fall under the breach of a civill law more hardly perhaps to be persued, then the lawes against heresie, blasphemie, breaking of the sabb^th day, etc. In such a case as wee are alwayes ready in our good^ and ^o^ies to the increasing and upholding of his maiesties honour, and estate, so according to our possibilitie, and the occurrent necessitie of his Highnesse affaires, we cheerfully offer our best supplies and helpe. And for ease of our iust grievances, and feares of our Christian libertie from constraint of ceremonies, we humbly beg to haue returned ratification of our ancient liberties of religion. Ceremonies should bee persuaded by reason, and not inforced by compulsion. Propter externoritus disciplinae homines pios ferire, neque domini est voluntas neque purioris Ecclesiae mos. In the name of the Lord Iesus wee require your Honours, that at this time ye walk in the matters of the kirk, as one day yee shall be iudged dutifull according to the Scriptures following: Beware of men, beware of evill workers. Let no man beguile you with entising words. Stand fast in the faith; quit you like men. Be strong. Stand fast in the libertie wherewith Christ hath made you free, and bee not intangled againe with the yoak of bondage. Hold fast the forme of sound words. That good thing which is committed unto thee, keepe. Contend earnestly for the faith which was once given to the Saints. Seing ye know these things before, beware lest yee fall from your owne stedfastnesse. Strengthen the things which remaine that are ready to die. Remember how thou hast received and heard. And hold fast and repent. If thou watch not, I will come upon the suddenly, like a thiefe in the night, and thou shalt not know what houre. They haue no courage for the truth upon earth, Jerem. 9.3.

Five reasons wherefore the fiue Articles of Perth ought not to be ratified in this present Parliament.
Other reasons.FIrst, because that assembly was not lawfully constitute, wanting a fundamentall priviledge of a lawfull assembly; in respect that contrary to the act of the generall Assembly holden anno 1600, and anno 1568. Bishops, Barons, and Burgesses voted, not being authorized with Commissioners from Synods, Presbyteries nor Sessions of Kirks. His maiesties letter direct to particular Barons and Burgesses, without commission from their incorporations, could not giue them vote in Parliament, much lesse in the generall Assembly.
Secondly, putting the case that those Articles were indifferent, yet the Assembly hath erred, in respect it hath concluded contrary to the Apostolick rule in things in different, which is, that the practise should not onely not compell him that for conscience refuseth to practise, but also, least hee offend him, should forbeare to practise himselfe, Propter conscientiam non tuam sed ipsius dico, 1. Cor. 10.29. If thy brother be grieved for thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably, destroy him not for thy meat for whom Christ hath died, Rom. 14. vers. 15.
Thirdly, because the foresaid Articles being determined in alteram parte per circumstantias impeditivas in themselues are unlawfull. The observation of it drawing with it a revolt and returning back againe to Popish rites and ceremonies; a violation of our profession, su^^^tions, and othes, whereby we renounced them; a confirming of Papists in their errours, and putting them in hope of our comming to them in more substantiall poynts; a grieving of the hearts of all zealously affected, a preparatiue in the hearts of the commonlie (who m^^s^^e religion more by the externall maske of ceremonies, then by substan^iall poynts of doctrine to the receiving againe of whole Poperie; a terrible renting of this kirke, inducing Atheisme in place of Religion, the people no^ knowing what to beleeue, and seeing the observation of Yuile obtained, which before discharged by Act of Parliament in all pulpits of Scotland was sufficiently declared to bee the invention and tradition of man, to bee will worship, superstition, entertaining the people in an errour anent the the birth of Christ, leading them to all sort of excesse and profanation, and Geni^ulation the first of the 15 ceremonies of the Masse, teste B^llarmino, a gesture invented and ordained onely by Antichrist more than 1300 yeares after Christ, a^ the principall externall worship of their ^^^den god now inforced in the (...) of the Lords supper, under pretence of indifferencie, more reverence and humilitie. As though we were not forbidden praecepto negativo, to presume to giue or recei^e the communion more reverently then Christ and his Disciples did, or that we were not commanded praecepto affirmativo, to imitate Christ in all his religious actions neither miraculous nor admirable, nor having a particular reason restricting them to that time: (...) though we were not warranted praecepto comparativo rather to imitate Christ with a table gesture in that holy banquet, then Antichrist with a gesture of adoration inductiue to Idolatry: or as though a man were able to give a reason why the surplice, the crosse, and the elevation of the bread may not as well be received (being of more antiquit^^ and if the Minister having a surplice with crossing elevat the ^read, and the people how their knee, what want we of a Masse, Vo^ semelde erratum est, in praeceps devenitur.
Fourthly, because if the high commission bee imboldened by ratification

of this Parliament to depriue Ministers, that will stand out against these ceremonies, being the greatest number of the best qualified, most painfull and fruitfull of their calling within the land, what a lamentable desolation shall it draw upon this Church? what a wound shall it be to every godly heart to see their faithfull Pastors deprived, warded, and ^^n s^^^l forgiving the communion as Christ gave it, and refusing to gi^^^^ f^^r the forme of antichrist? Is this a time to obtrude Antich^^sti^^ ^^remonies in the kirk, when the bloo^y sword of Antichrist is (...) in the bloud of so many thousand protestants in France and Germanie.
Lastly (...) it was never seen, that this Parliament confirmed the acts of ^^y assembly, which they know was called in question, not onely by a great number of the speciall of the ministerie, but also by the greatest part of the most zealous prof^^^^our, of the whole bo^y of the kingdome, as is m^nif^st by the practise of Edinburgh seeking the Lords supper in thous^^^ without the citie.









An admonition to the well affected Nobilitie, Barone and burgesses, Commissioners in this present Parliament.
Admonitions to the same effect.DOE not your Honours now at last perceiue, how mightily the Mysterie of iniquitie the spirit of Antichrist, the power of darknesse and delusion prev^iles amongst us in the judgement of God; presuppose not in the intention of man, which we presume not to search, but leaue to the Lord the searcher of hearts. If Papists goe free, who used to be fined, if professors be counted Puritanes, and religion disgraced, if patrons of Poperie be set at libertie, and the faithfull committed, if Seminarie Priests goe abroad, and true Pastors be confined and imprisoned, if sea ports be patent to forraine Papists and banished Ministers lye vnrecalled, if sundry statesmen be small friends to true profession, and not unfriends to Papistry, if time servers and men pleasers usurpe commission for Christ^ kirk being her greatest enemies, if Papists do incroach and professors grow ^old. If it be discharged that search be made for mass-priests, or that these foxes being discovered, should be apprehended as your honours may try, whose intelligence is better, is not there the sound of the sound of the f^^t of Popery at the doores, whereunto the Lord hath long threatned to c^^t us. The discipline of Christs kirk is already welneere destroyed, and turned Antichristian by the usurpation and tyranny of our Prelats. The worship of God is next, and now among your hands which if ye suffer to be polluted by the Romish leaven of their unhallowed rites, as sundry of the ministery unwisely haue done, we may iustly feare the corruption of doctrine, and so all is gone.
Consider then, that the touchstone to try your loue to the truth, is at this time, the act concerning these cursed ceremonies, counted indifferent by many, but in effect pernicious, the bringing back again wherof by the confession of all, even of the vrgers, is at least unnecessary and untimous, and so in religion abhominable and impious. But if we will say the truth, it is 1. a returning with the dogg to the vomit, 2. to Papists and professours scandalous, 3. contrary to the word, as is largely proven by sundry, and so presumptuous, 4. in regard of the present use, whersoever they are received, proving superstitious, 5. by reason of the oath of God, which hereby is despised, bl^sphemous, 6. in regard of the consequences damnable and divelish, and for the manner of their establishing by violence and craftines, to all them who haue eyes, odious. Which, as your honours in Gods mercie haue marked, so haue you done well that being privily tried, yee have not dissembled your dislike both of the cause, and the cro^ked convoy of it. For well might ye know, when supplicants were sent to prison, and truth was misconstrued and counted treason; when Ministers were discharged off the tow^^ for feare of requesting your Honours to stand for the Lord, little good was to be looked after so godlesse a beginning. It rests now, that ye be constant and setled in the loue of the truth. By threatnings, by allurements, by hopes, by feares touching your selues and your faithful pastors, and other endlesse wayes of darknesse they studie to draw away and divert you either to make you vote against Christ, or to be Newtrall^ and Nonliqu^ts: or to slide away and denie your presence by one meanes or other; to draw you under the curse of Meroz for not helping the Lord against the mightie. But the busier they are, the lesse freedome in this Parliament; the lesse worth in their causes, the greater is your triall, who stand to give testimonie to Christ, your faith the more pretious, and your reward the more glorious. For God hath sayd, Hee that overcommeth shall inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he shall be my sonne.Rev. 21.8. But the fearfull (that is, such who for feare of man dare not giue testimony to the truth of God) and the unbeleeving, etc shall haue their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstome, which is the second death.








Another Admonition.
PLease your Honours take heed what you doe at this peremptor time concerning the establishing of the unlawfull act of the pretended assembly of Perth. Christ hath put his cause in your hands; be faithfull now or never. Beware of bringing back and casting in again of this stumbling block. The glory of God, the standing of the kirk of this land, your own soules, and the soules of many thousands, for whom Christ Jesus died, is now in hazard, and depends much (if ye look to outward meanes) vpon your fidelitie, wherof ye shall not want witnes neither in heaven nor

earth The eyes of men and Angels are upon you, the eyes of those who mourne for the mis ries of Gods kirk are longing for comfort from you. And the great iudge of the world, the almightie our God, whose eyes are all a flaming ^^re, ^^e behold every mans part in this present Parliament. Yo^^ vote^, your actes, your name^ shall be registrate to all posterity. Ponder the ^^ore the w^ght of the cause where with ye meddle, and the fearfull in^^ (...) w^^^ doe accompany and shal follow the ratification of the act of ^h^^ ^tended ass^^ly, that will ^efall the king o^n of Christ, his ministery, the ^est part of sin^ere profe (...) your f^iends and familiars, your children and posterity, and it may be also your owne persons both spiritually and ^^lly. For if, according to your pl^ce, in prudent and humble maner yee do not resist the esta^^shing of that act ^y all lawfull meanes, yee cannot cl^^^^ your^s^lves of ^^spi^ing the (...) and covenant of God solemnly s^^ (...) s^^s^rived ^y a^^^ st^tes, an^ of drawing down the undoubted cu^s^^ of God, which h^st (...) n^w to come upon (...) cannot be guiltles of (...) and (...) liuing the Papist to (...) th^n wee are w^^e off, ye^ and of the gre^ving of the hearts of the kings ^est su^iects, of bringing th^i^ faith, and casting them in ^^plexitie how to serve both God and their natiue king. Ye^ cannot be guiltie ^e of the thrusting out of faithfull ministers, and bringing in of yong boyes, ^i^^l^ngs and time server^ to the overthrow of the Gospel, (...) slaughter of souls. Ye cannot misse to draw th^ wh^le ^and in a snare, and in special the weaker Christi ns, who by the f r^e of civil law must either suffer their guides to become a prey to worse subiects th^n themselves, or at least their meanes and estates to be so pilled and impaired by ^ines and penalties, as in a short time they shall neither be able to serve their king, their countrey, nor their ^^n necessities, or else to controll and enthrall the^r conscien^es to the d^struction of their souls. Now is the time wis^ly to prevent these things, which if ye doe, time shall approve you, God and good men shall ^cknowledge you in this poynt, better Christians, better Statesmen, better servants of God, more (...) and wis^ subiects to the king, better friends t^ kirk and commonweal, then they who upon whatsoever pretences shall either urge or yeeld to the contrarie. Resist the^^ore the establishing of ceremonie, as a reen^rie of Papistrie. Our neighbour countrey grones under th^ york which now is presented again to their n^^k^, and would redeeme the libertie which you haue had, and y t in some me^sure enioy. It cost your predessor^ many a tear with God, and their utterm st endevo^ with men to purchase and transmit this liberty vnto you^ and Christ hath bought it with his bloud for you. Count not so lightly of it, as to loose it for a moment, ^ut stand fast in that liberty wherwith Christ hath made you free, and be not intangled again with the yoake of ^ond^ge. Good su^iects haue no iust cause to fear the offence of a good king in maintaining God right and their owne, so long as their cause is honest, and their d^fen^e lawful. Stand therfore for the truth, and confesse Christ before men, a^ ye would that he shold confess you before the father.







Archip.
If they had taken time to ponder your reasons and exhortations, I cannot think that they could haue resisted so great evidence of truth so powerfully expressed. But what resolution was taken in case all these meanes should fail^?


Epaph.
The Ministers resolved upon the last remedie: a Protestation vvhich they left behind them in these words.




MAy it please your Honours in this present Parliament, assembled ^nder the right high and excellent May of our de^^ and dread Sov.Protestatio^ to the Parliament.
We haue now before our eyes the for^seen and foretold bitter fruits of these alterations of the Kirk, and ^^^t fear of farther evils to ensue upon such dangerous beginnings, so much the more, as wee are deprived of that ordinarie and general Assembly whereunto properly belongs to propone at Parliament the Kirk affaires. And although for supplement of this pittifull defect, in ^^umble ^^nner we did offer our reasonable supplication, conform to his High, proclamation, we (...) haue no place to be heard in our lawfull and religious desires. In this hard and heavie case the sensible danger of our untim^^s silen^e in th^se ^aies of the growth of som decay of grace, contempt of th^ Gospell, and troubles abro^d moved for the most part by the patrons of that bloudy Co^cel of Trent, and the cons^ience of our inevitable co^pearance before the judgment s^at of Christ, to giue an account of our stewardship, compels us, as (...) high extremitie, to declare to your H^^our bounden and harty affection, to hold fast that an^ient faith and forme of Religion, received, beleeved and defended by the Kirk ^f S^^tl. the King Maj. and E^tates, the whole bodie of this R^^lm, your for^^eers of worthy memory, and your selues; as God eternal truth and onely ground of our salvation, and of our high peace and prosperity by Gods undeserved mercie so long continued: as also our unfaigned detestation of all formes and ceremonies, many or few, that enemies of the truth may cast in our teeth as signes of repentance of our reformation, or any part therof, and presages to them of our return to their damned superstition, either substance or ceremonies therof. And likewise in the name of Iesus Christ, wh^ shall render to every one, that which he hath done in the fl^sh, to require your Hon^^: to stand stedfastly for the said ancient Religion, f^rme of doctrine, Sacracraments and Dis^ipture, as they haue been ministred in this Kirk ever since the Reformation of Religion, for the jurisdiction and libertie of the true Kirk, generall and provincial Assemblies, Presbyteries and Sessions, as they are established by the Kirk, and lawes of this Kingdome, and against all usurpation and corruption of spiritual government, and unnecessary Ceremonies, as the fiue Articles of ^^th Assembly, and whatsoever is as aples of strife, and dead^y destroyers of the kirk of Iesus Christ.
Otherwise, if it shall happen (as God forbid) that any matter ^e propounded, put in article, or concluded in this present Parliament, in prejudice of the said Religion, and acts of Parliament pa^t in favors of the same, with sorrow, and sore against our harts we will be constrained to use the remedy

of Protestation. Like as a^hering to the protestations made to the Parliament holden at P^rth in the yeare of God 1606, and to the Protestation used in the last Parliament holden at Edinburgh, and to all other Protestation^ whatsoever made in favour of this Kirk, and against all hurts and injuries intended against the same. By these presents, we solemnly protest all, and whatsoever Articles, ^^ctes, and others whatsoever shall be propoued, concluded and publ^shed in or from this present Parliament in prejudice of the iur^sdiction and libertie of the Kirk, Assemblies therof, order st^^^^shed, or any part therof; or in favours of usurped governement and damned Hierarchie, of Ceremonies and alterations whatsoever, concerning the ministration of the Sacraments, or any other point, or practise of discipline received in this Kingdome. And for due execution hereof wills and request our welbeloved Brother (...) to subscribe, and to present the same, as off^cers in open face of Parliament, to the Lords of Articles being conveened, and, if need bee, to affixe the same upon the Parliament house dore, or Market crosse of Edinburgh. To the effect, that our reasonable diss^ssent from all and whatsoever, may in any sort pre^udge the forme of Religion established in this Kingdome, may be not o^ly knowen.

At Edinburgh the 25 day of Iuly 1621.







Archip.
Ye haue shewed me evident testimonies of their fidelitie, vvhich maugre oblivion and malice vvill bide after them, vvhen they are gone out of ^his vvorld, as they l^ft ^hem behind, vvhen they vvere put out of that Towne I would now know vvhat vvas the successe.


Epaph.
The former reasons and admonitions took impression in many hearts, few vvere in any doubt vvhat to doe, if they had been left to their own libertie: for there was not one vvh^ either respected these fiue Articles for their own good qualitie, or for the Kirks authoritie: neith^r ever to this day were they honoured with the name of an Act of the generall Assembly, but beare the note of basenesse in the title of Articles. All the perplexity was, vvhat to doe in so great extremitie and urging importunitie: for the Masters of vvork, both for compassing the purpose, and keeping themselues from censure, set their wits by all meanes to vvorke so many, as they might, to be of their mind. And for this effect there vvas no small businesse in the beginning to single out and set inclinable Lords and Noblemen, and so to make way for their Election, who vvere to sit upon the Articles, that therby might be gained in hope of further victorie thirty and two Votes at least in their judgement, vvho had made prosperous tryall of such cunning first at Perth: and now knowing vvith vvhom they dealt, had no lesse hope of successe here.


Archipp.
That would seeme to be like the policie of our late

Ecclesiasticall Assemblies, in chosing of the privie conference. But after so full preparation, vvhether vvas the day appointed for holding the Parliament now at last observed vvith the vvonted solemnitie?


Epaph.
It vvas;Riding of the Parli^ment. for upon Wednesday the 25 of Iuly 1621 at the Palace of Halvroode-house, there is first a Majesticall appearance of high honour and splendor glancing from that glorious convention prepared for the sacred and high Court of Parliament, the most excellent person of the mightie King and Head of this Monarchie, being resembled by the potent and noble Lord Iames Marquesse of Hammilton his Highnesse Commissioner, and the Estates of Parliament ranked according to the worth of their persons, and the deserved and unspotted dignitie of their places. And then they marched in state from the said palace with honour^ borne according to th^ custome of this ancient Kingdome, the Crown by the Earle of Angus^, the Scepter by th^ Earle of Mar^, the Sword by the Earle of Rothesse to the Parliament house, where they entred and set themselues in their honourable places, neither Papists nor any other sort of persons desirous to heare and see, being excluded.


Archipp.
Why passe yee the Prelacie, vvho of dutie ought to haue beene first remembred in this their owne Ceremoniall Parliament.


Epaph.
Neither ye not I can remember them vvith such acclamation of joy, as a Papist did, who before many Gentlemen cryed aloud in the street vvith lifted up hand directing his speech to the Bi hop of Santandroes. God blesse you my Lord, with all your Brethren and favourers of your course; for you and they are furthering the way to content his Majestie, and us all that are Catholickes, which God prosper, and none resists, except a number of evill disposed Ministers. But the clamour of the multitude, and the accustomed noise at su^h times suppressed the bablings of the seditious Parasite, and buried them in their eares vvho vvere neerest unto himselfe.


Archipp.
Seeing Papists tooke the boldnesse both to speak upon the street, and to be present in the house, modest Ministers would haue been overseen, notwithstanding of the straitnesse of the Proclamation against them.


Epaph.
Yet there vvas speciall care recommended to the double guard vvithout and vvithin, and as great attendance given that no M^nister vvanting the Bishops licence should be suffered to enter. And after that the members of the Parliament vvere placed, a second search made for Ministers, that if any had been permitted to enter, they might be removed.


Archip.
How can yee be able to lead me through to the end,

seeing ye were neither an actor, nor permitted to be witnesse of the remanent proceeding?


Epaph.
The Ly^ian ring is worne away long since. Any of the beholders could relate all that vvas done openly: every one of the members of the Court could not see vvhat vvas done secretly. Lookers on many times see more then gamesters; and in the val^ the hill is best seen.


Archip.
If ye take upon you to tell me the truth, I will cease to be curious about the mean of your information: vvhat was done in that first meeting.


Epaph.
First the B. of Santandroes after a verie short prayer, read a part of Scripture,Speeches in ^^e house of Parliament Rom. 13.7. and delivered a discourse chiefly intending to perswade the taxation. After him my Lord Commissioner had a speech, declaring to the Estates his Maj. great and extraordinary troubles, and continuall debursements in supporting the King of Boheme, his Queen, and their mother, and in continual sending of Embassadors to France, Germany and Spaine to travel for peace among the Christian Princes, besides the extraordinary aids given to the Germane Princes to retain them vvithin the compasse of the band of friendship and alliance, the charges of maintaining a sea Navie under the conduct of Sir Robert Mansfield; adding also that his Maj. suslained and suffered more for the persecutions and afflictions of the Protestants, and for the defence of the Reformed Kirk then all the Princes in the world besides, with divers other insinuations to perswade a large supply: And for furtherance therof his L. professed to haue vvarrant to giue vvay to any good advice, wherby mony might increase and abound among us after the taxation. His L spake for the ^^ue Articles under the name of matters of Kirk Discipline, that had been concluded in former Assemblies, practised in the Primitiue Church, not forbidden by the word of God, and so able to be defined by the Prince, who hath lawful power to command in matters indifferent. He doubted nothing of their good affection, and concourse to the good advancement of so necessary a service, is was then in hand. And for himself he should striue to let his Maj. know every mans part: and he for his part would contribute his best endevours to a good successe. In the third place (...) Lord Chancell^^r had his Quanqu^m, wherin he spake to the ^^^our of the auncient, the quality of the Solium Regale, where the Commissioner ^a^^, the persons vvho were members of that Assembly severally, giving every one his own due, and with repetition of some things touched by the Co^missioner and the Bish. of S. androes, concerning the necessity imposed upon our liberality, and experience to giue way to the Church ordinances, fetching some conclusion from old judgement of Re^ and Sacerdos in the person of Numa:

he ended with an exhortation to the Lords, to goe cheerfully and with a good mind to the election of the Lords of Articles.


Archip.
Never was Scipio, Hannibal, Maccabeus, never C^drus, Thrasybulus, nor Themistocles, or any Grecian, Romane, or Iew, so much obliged for their Countrey, as these three persons for the defence and maintenance of the true Religion, and common estate of Scotland; of the priviledges, lawes and liberties pertaining to the one and the other: they being debters to the Kirk and Common-weale of their life, liberty, honourable places and callings, of their present condition and future expectation: and lying under the obligation of birth, education, imitation of their honourable predecessours, of their offices, personall promises, and whatsoever other obligatorie respects: And therefore it cannot be but in the midst of so many dangers present and imminent, they behoved to say something, both for testfying their hearty affections, and for the weale of the Realme.


Epaph.
That was not their errand, and had been a contradiction to the other part of their speech, and to their following actions: and therefore without further mention of publicke matters, or any insinuation of their oblished affection to their spirituall mother the Kirk crying for their help; or to their naturall mother the Countrey trembling under the burthen of divers calamities, and under the terrour of forrain feare, the actions of the utter house were closed for that time.


Archip.
Was there no further done that day for advancement of the purpose?


Epaph.
Not so much in shew, as that vvhich is done, but more in substance. For the Lord Commissioner,Election of the Lords of Articles, and their proceedings the Nobility and Prelates, with Chancellour, Treasurer, Secretarie, and Clerke Register, Officers of Estate, the life and leaders of this compend of the Kingdome, went into the inner house, for election of the LL. of Articles, not after that most free forme beseeming Parliaments and Counsels, where choice is made of persons most indifferent, of best judgement, and no way partially affected to any partie, or restrained to the loue of any cause, but by some learned oblivion of this most reasonable rule, and by some new law, hid custom and singular practick, for performing of the most free, harmelesse and innocent part of this high action, the election of the Lords of Articles proceeded in another sort.


Archip.
Ye are now upon the primum mobile, the secret wheeles, which guide the hand and hammer without: and therefore remove the cover, that I may see the beginnning of the motion.


Epaph.
The Bishops who from their first fabrick haue sounded many ill houres to this Kirk and Countrey, continually behaving

themselues as Peeres of the Kingdome, professed parties against the Ministers and Discipline, and as partiall Iudges and led Witnesses, when questions concerning Ministers or Kirk governement did occurre: or where opposition was to be made to matters proponed in prejudice of the one and the other, they went to their roomes, and were not onely silent contrary to the debt of their places: but all singing one song, the rest following the first, in a reasonlesse harmony rare to be found in Paris, Venice, or the most famous Counsells in the world: they did choose those eight of the Nobility, Auguss, Mortoun, Nithesdall, Wigtoun, Roxburgh, Buck^lugh, Scone, Carnegie and these made eight of the Bishops, Sant^ndroes, Glasgow, Dunkeld, Aberdeen, Brechin, Dumblane, Argyle, Orknay: and these altogether did choose eight Barones and eight Burgesses. A faire election of foure eights, receiving their names from the clieff of the song, and inspired with the concord of the first eight, who would bee loath to choose any different from their owne minde, and of the second eight conforme to them.


Archip.
Was there never a note out of tune?


Epaph.
By providence two notes of the third eight, and one of the fourth jarred a little to make the melodie of the whole 32 the more sensible to the eares of the hearers by their irregularity. Finally, for augmenting the number of fair drawn voters, the seven Officers of Estate, Chancellour, Treasurer, Secreter, Privie-seale, Iustice Clearke, Advocate, and Clearke Register are adjoyned; all faithfull servants, and loath by crossing or comming in the contrary of present intentions, to perill their liberall pensions, their great Offices, their present imployments, and hopes of higher preferment.


Archip.
That election so enlarged and qualified with those last seven, is a strong first fell, and a great conquest of votes in favours of chiefe desires.


Epaph.
Yet it is not quarrelled here, as in former times, when mens own particulars were in hand. Then presence was weak, now absence is strong. What Prince and prelate could nor work vvhen Kirk rent sacrilegiously possessed was but under feare of quarrell, now in these Halcion daies, vvhen mens particulars are out of feare, Politickes and Prelates can easily bring to passe, and so the first strength of the Parliament is taken in presage of expected victorie.


Archip.
No marvell, for the case is altered. Which vvas the first meeting of the Lords, I may say, of the fiue Articles thus elected?


Epaph.
Vpon Thursday the 26 of Iuly, after the Cabinet

Counsell, vvhich daily met in the Abbay by sixe in the morning and sate vvhile nine, to dresse and dispose matters to be done in such a course, as might leade most easily to the destinate end.


Archip.
Those Lords of Articles convened did they enter at their first meeting upon the fiue Articles?


Epaph
The Kirk is prejudged heere of her ancient priviledge, to her great losse, and they, that all matters may be rightly tymed, are wisely directed to treat of the matter of Taxation in the first place: because so many as vvere affectioned to liberty from Ceremonies, under that hope would be easily induced to a large subsidie, vvherein they had perhaps been found lesse willing, or more hardly disposed, if they had not looked to decline that bondage. When the taxation vvas concluded then vvere brought in into the second place the matters of the Kirk.


Archip.
Yet considering the oppositions justly made against these Articles at Perth; the violent and crooked wayes, vvherby they vvere rather forced and imposed, then concluded vvith consent, as reason and the custome of the Kirkes craved; the hard practises past against certain honest Ministers, and great discontentment universally in the Country tending to dangerous distractions for refusall of a sort of obedience, vvhich is no vvaies directed by the act it self, nor nor once motioned, but greatly feared, when they vvere so eagerly dealt for, and now, when the just fear of more desperate inconveniences, and the conscience of the calling of God did inforce to try the difference betwixt an act, or rather an advice of the Kirk simple and free of all sanction or censure, to be imposed upon the Contraveeners, and a law of authority which may be made vigorous and forcible by the hand of the Magistrate for arbitrarie execution against innocent and harmelesse Pastors, and people uncapable of these practises by reason of personall restraint and perswasion of their own minds to the contrary, I can hardly be induced to thinke howsoever nothing vvas spoken in the face of the Parliament, yet now in private amongst themselues, they vvill peremptorily determine, without due deliberation at least, if not for purging the humour, yet for snibbing the Canker to prevent utter consumption, their care will be more bended there then in all other matters.


Epaph.
Your commendable judgement of charity tels you, what should be done, but verity must tell vvhat vvas done. At the incomming of the Article of the taxation, the Lord Commissioner spake as before, to further, upon the ordinary and extraordinary taxations, proportions therof, and questions moved anent the exemption and priviledges of the Lords of Session, which being matters

touching mens persons and their worldly particulars, are attended diligently, a large time b^ the space of whole three daies spent in reasoning, voting, preferring petitions, receiving answeres, and setling conditions in favour of men fearing their own hurt. Nothing concluded but with great advisement and very circumspectly. But the other being matters of Religion touching men in their conscience, and the Kirk in her peace, as things indifferent were quickly and smoothly past in verie short space vvithout search of any of your many difficulties, albeit with seene opposition and dissassent of so many, as in the providence of God might in such a time and place beare witnesse to the truth.


Archip.
Was the consent of the Lords of the Articles of such force, that there was no hope of remedy afterwards.


Epaph.
By ordinary custome of former times, purposes once past in the Articles haue good appearance to goe through at Parliament. But the Plot-masters of the fiue Articles; partly through feare of hard successe, which they had certainely found by suddain voting in publick; and partly to keep their own plantation free of disgracefull opposition, and themselues with their Associates from the blame of madnesse by the multitude of companions, they dare not hazard at the first; but resolue to hold the Parliament sitting and the Lords of the Articles doing for some daies,Policies making way for conclusions. till they can see a faire day for conclusion through the stormes of common rumour, and diligent travels of many then set to opposition.


Archip.
What was the task of the Lords of Articles during that large time; for the Parliament was not closed till the 4 of August?


Epaph.
After some particulars of private men; they were set to hunting, hauking, fowling etc. to make some sumptuarie lawes against banquetting, and some vestiary against Pasments silk etc. for prolonging time, when their minds were upon nothing lesse then upon that pastime.


Archip.
What cunning vvas used in the meane time for contriving the conclusion?


Epaph.
Ye know that it is taught by the Masters of Policy, that they who would worke men to their purpose, must either haue some knowledge of their inclinations, and so perswade them: or their infirmities and feares, and so awe them, or of those who haue the government of them, and so rule them. And at this time the very profundities of our homely policies were opened up, tanquam pro aris and fo^is.


Archip.
But I know that Commissioners of Parliament should

be men of another mettall. He that willeth Christians to be innocent as Doues in their dealing with others, warneth them also to be as wise as serpents in the dealing of others with them.


Epaph.
Yet some are so possest with a prejudicate opinion, that they thinke all sincerity and conscience, either to be pretended onely, as it is too often, or to proceed out of phantasie, simplicitie of manners, and inexperience of the affaires of the world: So that in their estimation, confirmed by so many instances, as may make up more then one experience, no man almost is so nice, but he may be talked with, if he be taken on the right side. Vpon this ground the solistations, protestations,(...). Maxima pars hominu^ hunc habet morem, quod sibi volunt, dum id impet^ant boni sunt, sed id ubi penes so habent ex bonis pessimi and fraudulentissimi fiunt. and promises of great reward, often used since the beginning of the Parliament are here againe enlarged amply, and engyred finely for soupling such with suceties, as they take to be Minnies mouthes. And for the hopefull generation of greater spirits, whether thinking by contradiction to ascend, or straited with their own necessities, there were dressed large promises of great rewards for service to be done at this time, with great enforcements of nodds and complements of the most significant sort for bewitching the eyes of the good Gentlemen to apprehend felicity in their own facility, and their standing or falling in the verball insinuations of their said friends.


Archip.
That might be a policie for some, but it could not serue for all, especially for such as were at their hopes end with the world.


Epaph.
Benefits already received were presented to that sort in the cup of exprobation, to dash them with the wrath of their unthankefulnes, and feare of former favour to be unrecoverably lost, if at this time they did not proue more then honest men. Some were threatned with utter ruine: and the sillier sort terrified out of their wits with loud blasts of highest displeasure, ready to draw on without delay a deluge of desolations upon the Kirk, if the Articles happened at that time to be refused.


Archip.
Both these are like Mathematicall Midses to demonstrate Metaphysicall conclusions; with vvhat face could the world be so used for an argument in matters of Religion?


Epaph.
The matters were couched in the corners of extenuation, and vilified in the dust of indifferencie; howsoever they were eminent and highest in their desires and intention, and had more lovers and friends to doe for them, then Religion it selfe I feare should find were it to passe in an act of Parliament.


Archip.
Yet I am sure these Ringleaders could not well know the names of many Commissioners and Voters, farre lesse their severall dispositions and intentions.



Epaph.
For gaining be unknown, and trying all, treacherous Intelligencers are sent forth, in outward apparance men of verie good sort, but indeed of the generation of the Neronian quadruplators to shuffle themselues in all honest companies, but specially in the meetings of Noblemen commissioners of Shires and Burrowes,Delator^^, ho ^^num genus publice exitio ^ep^tium and po^nis quid^m nun^nam satis co^citum. Tacit. vvhere under colour of the same affection and inclination to like or dislike, as those Sinons found the disposition of companies vvhere they happened to be, they lurked; but still aboue all things they counterfeited a dislike of Per^h Articles; and by that vile and base Iudas like dissimulation sucked out mens minds, and became acquaint vvith all their counsels that vvisely vvere not aware of them. The points of their false profession vvere to learne mens names, their natures and their purposes, that thereby they might be the more able to enforme their Masters, Who was what, and who was not. And some of the cut-throats, vvhere they were admitted vvould seeme in presence to giue approbation to such things as they heard, that so they might goe lesse suspected: and sometime by their pernicious fraud, vvhere they durst adventure, they vvould divert honest men most craftily from good motions and resolutions, and then at night returne to their directors, like venemous vvaspes clogged vvith filthy lies and flattering suggestions; Albeit there vvere some like Aesops Flee, that sate upon the Axetree of the Coach vvheele, and sayd, What a dust doe I raise?


Archip.
Particular persons might be known and disappointed by that craft; but vvhen they conveened vvith the Estates, wherof they vvere members, they b^hoved to bewray themselues, and so be brought by the rest to a right mind againe.


Eppah.
The Noblemen and Commissioners of Shires and Burrowes, in a mild manner of Imperious request, vvere restrained from the necessary use of the ancient priviledge granted to the severall Estates of this land, to conveene by themselues in time of Parliament, for advising, reasoning, and preparing themselues the more deliberately to vote in publicke. And although for their better information it vvas promised, that they should haue inspection of things past by the Lords of Articles, at least 24 houres before meeting in publick, it vvas not onely refused, but they were enjoyned that they should never upon any condition haue meeting at any time or place, vvithout speciall consent given by my Lord Commissioner.


Archip.
(...).I can reply nothing in this case; your depths are become so shallow that a vveake eye may see the ground of them. I vvould never haue looked that the former deceivers could haue reported so much as the common favour of Augustus or Phillip, Amoprodituro^,

non proditores, or that the alternatiue of Themistocles going with commission to the Andrians, could haue been heere allowed, either fairnesse or force, words or violence.


Epaph.
I might open unto you greater depths,(...). Suadam and violentiam (...). vvherein Shippes vvere seene sailing, and Eagles attending them, and discover secrets vvhere Serpents vvere gliding, and the greatest Like a man with a maide playing, vvhen the most expert in the matter of Articles, and of best credit to make voters, vvent in paires: The first man, and his fellow labourer, The Scholer and his Pedigogue, The Principall and his cautioner, all running under great hope to come speed, and that both privately and publickely, in the house, and upon the street, at evening and morning, in all places and occasions, vvith as many fine formes as they did meet with fashions of men.


Archip.
Your Hieroglyphicks are obscure, and ye delight to be Acroamaticall.


Epaph.
I shall trouble you no more vvith them, but shall relate one policie as pithie as plaine to all; vvhereby absents vvere made present for voting, and they vvho vvere present vvere made absent from voting.


Archip.
Pithie it may be, but plaine it cannot be; for that seemes an impossibility through force of contradiction.


Epaph.
Ye are in the schooles, and I in the house of Parliament: ye are upon the Logicks, and I upon the Politicks. Ye perhaps never heard of Proxeis.Proxeit. But such vvas the force of our procuration in her prime and first rudiments, that she brought forth three miraculous effects: 1 Shee brought English Noblemen, neither having portion nor inheritance in this Realme, nor knowledge in our affaires Civill or Ecclesiasticall, to vote in a Scottish Parliament: 2 She made some, vvho had licences passed to remain from Parliament at that time, and had their excuses, admitted to vote by procurators: 3 She made some by the greater vvisedom and care of their faithfull Procurators, to vote against their own minds. And another vvay to make absents present, vvas by moving some vvho had obstinately refused, when they were elected by their Shires to accept commission, upon their refusall had taken instruments, and had sworn neither to ride nor vote in Parliament at that time, both to accept commission, and to be ready to vote.


Archip.
But how was it possible to make them vvho vvere present to be absent?


Epaph.
This was more easie, and was brought about with singular artifice, by many wayes and divers degrees. And first before the last day of the Parliament, divers Commissioners, who in derision

were called Puritanes, because they were more affected to the ancient liberties of the Kirk against obtruded novelties,Three policies to make them who were present to absent. were moved to leaue both Town and Parliament; and so were found some of them stragling through the Countrey; some visiting their friends, and some posting homeward, while the Parliament was yet sitting; all flying from apprehended danger upon the one side, and from inforcing importunity on the other.


Archip.
When was the last day, for that behoved to be the great day?


Epaph.
There was first a cautelous bruite broched and blowen abroad with a snell aire of seeming discontentment, that the Parliament would sit longer then was looked for, and it might be till the Articles were concluded: and then the voters of victorie being numbred, and successe brought under the eye of good hope, suddenly without the knowledge, and beside the expectation of many of the members of the Parliament, Saturday the foutth of August was chosen as the fittest time for closing the action.


Archip.
But it is not time yet for you to close your narration, ye must both shew me the other wayes of making them who were present, to be absent; and what was more done in that day.


Epaph.
The second vvay was as skilfull, but not so successefull as the first. Vpon some question of place betwixt two Lords of Parliament, both lovers of Religion, it was apprehended that they would rather loose their votes, then perill their dignity: And therefore strait commandement was given to Noble men to keep their own places. But as that worthy Grecian with his fellow-ambassadour buried their private emulations till their return, when the publicke affaires of the common-wealth were exped; so they perceiving the snare, packed up the controversie for that time, and of their Christian discretion, and generous affection, preferring a substantiall duety to a circumstantial ceremony kept their liberty, and so disappointed that policie. And as the first policie of this sort perswaded some to leaue the Town, so the second vvould haue moved others to leaue their riding. But on the other side I vvill tell you by the way that their policie could not make all to be present of vvhose concurrence they assured themselues. Divine providence in one example might haue been a sufficient instruction to let them see, how easily his Majestie might haue turned all their purposes and counsels to folly, if it had beene his pleasure, for that which befell one might haue befallen the rest. For one of the Commissioners vvhom they had to be a ringleader of the rest of the Commissioners of the Burgesses fell off his horse and gaue place to another. And vvho vvas this but that Commissioner of the chiefe Burgh Edinburgh, vvho fell

that day in the street, and was forced to giue place to a craftsman chosen in his roome to be peere to that first kneeling Provest of that Town, which was once as another Ierusalem s^nding the puritie, power and loue of the Gospell through all the corners of the kingdome but now (albeit the power of grace remaine in the hearts of many hundreds) is as vniversally scandalous through suddenly admitted novations by themselves and their pastors too penitent of their protestation, practisers, and preachers of contrary conformitie, and paternes of change to the whole countrey. The Lord give them hearts to remember from whence they are fallen, that they may repent and doe their first workes.


Archip
Who knoweth, but they who haue done so many things well for their common estate, common workes and priviledges of their towne, may doe somewhat (and the Lord blesse them with an open doore) for the libertie and flourishing estate of their kirke, to the wonted benefit of the whole realme. But proceed in the rest of your policies.


Epaph.
The next degree must be to keep them from voting, who had ridden, and now entred in the house of Parliament, and this vvas also brought about by perswading some Noblemen inwardly warned to vote against the fiue articles, but outwardly wrought upon to vote for them; to make a mid course, and to lurk in the inner house till the kirkes part was acted, and Gods vvorship through her sides had received a deadly wound, and then to come forth to the stage, and in their owne places to play their parts in civill matters. It is better to be altogether Christians with Paul, then to be almost Christians with Agrippa, or not all with Fe^tus; He that loveth father or mother (far more he that loveth the wo^^^) more then me, is not, etc.


Archip.
Yee remember Nicodemus, and Ioseph of Arimathea: But there had been no place left for that policie, if the former order kept in the Articles, when the kirk was postponed, had been now observed in face of Parliament.


Epaph.
To the end that this policie might haue place, when it was now made manifest, that other matters would not find great opposition, the kirk had a pathy pleader for her precedencie in publi^ke. For after the Lord commissioners speech, the Lord Chancellour spake for the kirkes right, alleadging that both reason and custome required, that the kirk haue the first place, and for that cause giveth direction, that the Act concerning the kirk, meaning the fiue articles, and ratification thereof, bee first read.


Archip.
What speech meane yee of the Lord Commissioner?



Epaph.
When all were now entred into the house, and were set in their owne places, after deep silence he had a preface for voting, short, but vehement; partly exhortatorie for yeelding to the fiue Articles of Per^^^^artly apologetick for defence of his Ma against surmises of Popish religion, partly declaratory, attesting that there was nothing under heaven that could be so acceptable to his Majestie, as that the Kirk of Scotland would receiue these fiue Articles; and partly promissorie, that he would ingage his honor, saith and credit upon that princely word which his Maiesty past to him, that if they would receiue these 5 articles at that time, his Highnes would never burden them with any more ceremonies during his life time; according to a promise utt^^^ed by the Bishop of Aberdein to the same meaning for casing the way to the articles, but without such reply, as was made to him by a Noble man, that hee was too liberall of his promises, having no assurance: for his Majesty would not bind himselfe after that sort.


Archip.
That prefa^e was a strong cup of digestion.


Epaph.
And was well seconded with the sweet sauce of my Lord Chancellors oration composed of two ingredients, loue and learning. For after he had pleaded in his Exordium for the Church her dignitie; it is, saith his L. an evident declaration of his Ma. loue to God and religion, that he hath so great care of the Kirk: and as for matters proponed, they require not much disputation, being already concluded by learned Bishops, Fathers, Doctors and Pastors convened at Perth for that effect. After this confirmation, the Lord Commissioner addeth the confutation: for against the apprehension and surmise, that his Maiestie was resolved to make this kirk in all things conforme to the Church of England; he did assume that his Ma. willed him to signifie unto them, that these being once concluded, he would urge no other rite nor ceremonie, and that by their according to these, they would give singular declaration of their loyalty; and therfore requested to take heed how they voted.


Archip.
Was there no mouth opened at this time to make reply, or to offer reason in the contrary?


Epaph.
No place was l^^t for reason, onely against that summary form of proceeding the promise made to the Nobility for having the conclusions of the Lords of Articles 24 houres at least before they were voted in publi^ke, was timously remembred and urged by a Noble man, to the effect they might, proceed with deliberation according to the worth of matters, especially the acts being long, and of great consequence, and not to give suddain iudgment, like as many ciphers, as in effect (sayd he) they were made by that form of dealing. I will not trouble you with the answer made to reasonable a motion, and bitter repulse of all further deliberation:

but I will draw now to the conclusion.


Epaph.
That is all, and I long to heare it, that I may see what proportion of policie is keeped, whether the end be answerable to the the beginnings and proceedings.


Archip.
In the conclusion,Threefold confusion in voting. when the matter is brought to the voters of the house, there was a threefold well studied confusion: first albeit the fiue articles were different in themselus, and the most part had different opinions concerning them; yet they were all hudled up in one bundell according to the practick and successe at Perth, that all of them might carry the savour of any one that was least resisted, and then every one the most misliked of them the favour of all. The same skill was used in ioyning the ordinary and extraordinary taxation: for divers of every estate thought hardly of the extraordinary taxation, all being most willing to giue large supply in the ordinary, answerable to the grat affaires in hand, and honour of the kingdome. And therefore upon assurance, that it would be refused by no man, the other was straitly tied to it. Secondly, advantage was taken of the conceived words, Agree and disagree the prescribed form of voting: for all being straitly discharged here as at Perth, to give any reason for their votes, that the co^clusion might passe ad numerum non ad vondus; or least the weight should be prejudicial to the number, and all directed to expresse the^selues simply in these words, it come to passe, that the second sillable of Disagree through the wide opening of the mouth at A, did eat up the first, especially in the low pronounciation of some, who being desired to speak out, threatnings and boastings vvith mena^ing eyes vvere breathed out against them, for the terror of others following: and so the negatiue vvere noted for affirmatiue. And thirdly, in calling the roll and marking the votes, the distinction of the three severall estates was suppressed, and all who had power to vote, were called promiscuously as so many single persons, that the conclusion might be made up by pluralitie of personall voters, without respect na^ to their corporations; whereas the Barrowes, one of the estates disagreed directly; and the other estate rightly considered, as it consisteth of greater and lesser Barons without mixture of officials of estate; and absents made present by their procurators, would haue made that estate doubtsome, if not negatiue; and so all the preceeding diligence from Perth assembly to this houre notwithstanding, the act of ceremonies had sound no other father at this time, except the Estate of Bishop, with others of equall engagement; as it will stil proue frowen faced as long as it is fathered upon others vvho begat it against their vvills; let men reioyce at the birth thereof, and busk it up as they please.





Archip.
Bu^king it hath need of, but the joy at the birth could no^ b^ great it b^ing conceived and formed by such meanes.


E^^ph.
Y^t, as upon the one side, the commissioners of Bor^^^ (...) sil^nt, or negatiue in the voting of that act of ^h^ f^^^ A^^^^l^^ (...) ^^fused of the ratification of the privil^^g^^ o^ th^^ B^^^ves, whi^h was granted to others: So upon th^^^^h r^si^^, (...) things are now (...) might unto the wished end, an^ w^^ (...)

A^^h^p
Y^^ ^ll (...) of the ratification of the ^ articles: but I ha^e h^^^d nothi^g wheth^r the pr^^^station, penned by the Ministers, and l^ft behind them, was vsed ^r not.


Epi^h.
The last ^ay, the entry of the house of Parliament, the most proper pla^e for using thereof, was most straitly kept, least any Minister should enter vvithout an Episcopall pasport. And for further se^uitie the Bishop of Saint Androwes man for his egregious eminencie, lest any gift should want imployment, was set over the inner barre, lik^ Saul amongst the people, for debarring all Ministers, in vvhose faces hee could see any prognosticke of a Protestation. And that Bishop himselfe required the Chancellour to charge the Constable and Marshall of the house to challenge all ministers within: of which number one being named by the Marshall upon that occasion answered, My Lord yee take me for the wrong man, the Bishop himselfe brought me in. Where through the Minister, undertaker to publish the protestation in the name of the Kirke, albeit hee was within the house of Parliament, yet could not fi^^ a^cesse for th^t ^ff^ct, and therefore vvent forth, and fixed one copie of the protestation aboue vvritten upon the doore of the T^^^^oth, and another upon the crosse. Againe upon the 20 of August, when the Acts of Parliament were proclaimed at the crosse of E^^nburgh, hee published three copies, one upon the Crosse; another upon the kirke doore; and the third upon the pila^e gate of Haly^ood house, vvhereupon hee took instruments with all r^quisi^e sol^mnities, using the vvords following: Here in the name of the brethren of the Ministery professing the religion a^ i^ hath been practised in our kirk since the reformation of the same:

I protest against all these things that haue been concluded in prejudice of our priviledges since the first reformation therof, and adheres to my former protestation m^^e and fixed on the Tolboo^h ^^lore ^nd other places; and to all the Protestations made in favours of the Kirk in the time of preceding Parliaments.


Archip.
It seemeth, that the fear of that Protestation before it was used, the distressed Estate of Religion through the Christian vvorld, and their own profession that they stand for the substance of Gods vvorship and l^bertie of the Kirk, howsoever they bee lib^rall in Ceremonies, should haue made them car full of the ratification of the truth, and of abolishing all contrary errour and superstition.


Epaph.
By the contrarie, upon deeper considerations,Act of Parliament. albeit the ratification of the libertie of the Kirk, of the Assemblies and Disci^line thereof, and anent tryall and punishment of the adversaries of true R^ligion hath ever been as ordinarie in Parliament since the reformation of Religion, as it was now necessarie: ye shall not find a word of that purpose among all the printed actes of this so long lasting Parliament. But ye may see in the last words of of the first act an act neither read nor voted in Parliament rescinding actes made in former times against superstition.


Archip.
But that nullitie is restrained by the clause, In so far^ as th^y be derogatiue to any of the Articles aboue written.


Epaph.
It is apparant then by their owne confession, that something is he e enacted against former actes of Parliament concerning the worship of God since the reformation, which some do^ altogether deny. But to answer you. I ask, if a transcendent power, a great man, or a ring leader presuming to doe vvhat he vvil, and through the spirit of slumber excusing himselfe from the common warning, Giue an account of thy stewardship, command a yong man in a place of service to doe vvhat pleaseth him; whether of the two shall make the commentary upon that clause? And must not such a tender flexible creature be more readie to please his Maker, then to stand upon points to the vvhat becommeth his place?


Archip.
So great alteration against so many strait bonds, the omitting of the ratification of the reformed Christian R^ligion at such a time, and the re-establishing of superstitious Antichristian ceremonies, might haue made the hearts of the agents to quake, the mindes of the multitude, vvho vvere suffered to bee present to bee miscontent; and the heavens and earth to bee astonished.


Epaph.
Ye bring me now to the third point that I proponed,

wherein I may say,Many witness^^ o^ a^^ sorts against the ^^^^eding and conclu^^on of Parliament. that beside the Supplication, Informations, Admi^^^tions and Protestation of the Messengers of God put out of the town, the mindes of the Actors, the voyces of the people declaring their feare and griefe, and the Heavens aboue vvere witnesses of the truth against that Act.


A^^^ip.
How can yee judge of the mindes of the Actors? The Lord knoweth the hearts and tryeth the reines.


Epaph.
And will also reward every man openly according to his vvorks done in (...). Yet none of the Actors could say, that in that action heave^ (...) to honour God, or to do good to his worship. The most part of the^ had professed freely in private many times before their dislike of the cause and crooked convoy thereof. And the Lord in his vvise providence discovered the feare of their hearts that last day of the Parliament very early. For about foure houres in the morning there went a pittifull cry through the high street of Edinburgh, Eye f^^^ly, Fire, Fire. The terrible sound of the common bell, which is seldome heard but upon great motions, filleth the cares of men, raiseth many out of their beds, and bringeth them in armes bare footed to the street, thinking that the people had made some insurrection. Through this confused confluence of people, and trouble of the vvhole town, albeit it was hard to discern, whether Master or servant was readiest to doe homage to servile feare; yet it vvas manifest, that men in highest places and known to haue strongest hand in the present course, were in greatest perturbation and perplexitie, till they were assured that there was no other intention, but to quench a fire, wherby a lodging at the New will of the Cowgate was destroyed vvithout recoverie, vvhich had been interpreted prodigious in any other place at such a time, and at this time and place, if the hearts of men had not been possessed vvith a greater fear at the first.


Archip.
How vvere the people vvitnesses, and by what meanes did they declare their judgement.


Epaph.
It vvere a thing impossible, to relate all their Observations. As when the newes vvere first brought to Scotland, that the Marquesse of Hammilton had undertaken that Commission, it vvas ^^grated by the best sort of all rankes, that the sonne of so vvo^^hie Parent^^ a nobleman of so great expectation and good affection to Kirk and Commonwealth, should be tempted to giue proofe of his fortaine learning, upon employment so directly crossing the will of the on^ and weale of the other. So the commonpeople partly out of their respect to him, and partly out of their feare of his Commission had frequently in their mouthes ^hese old verses of Knight Keggow.


O wretched Scot when Keggow turnes thy King,
Then may thou doole and dolour daily sing,
For from the South great sorrow shall be bring,
Therefore o'r Scot right short shall be his ring.

And,
The time will come, I trow as Thomas sayes,Heardmen shall hunt you up through gartings gillCasting the padle and letting the plough stand still.
Again the last day of the Parliament, great multitudes, being conveened in the utter Court of H^ly^oode-house to b^hold the solemnity, order and honours, as they were borne, did obserue at the verie instant, vvhen the Lords vvent to their horses and vvere now mounted, a Swan flying over their heads from the North towards the South, flaffings with her vvings and muttering her ominous song, whereat shaking their heads in their manner, and whispering amongst themselues, they declared vvhat opinion they had of the proceeding, and vvhat feare of a bad conclusion.
Ar hip. These two instances, vvhatsoever for^e they haue in themselues, are sufficient testimonies of the disposition and feares of the people. But how was it that the heavens were witnesses at that time? for I can not thinke that yee can like superstitious observation more then superstitious adoration.


Epaph.
I loue not the snares of superstition, which is the very reproach of the Godhead I know that faith in things divine, and right reason in things civill is better directer, then the observation of rare and prodigious events made by man, who are guided by their senses. Signes must follow and not lead the truth.Lucretius ait Epi^urum magno met^^ liberasse hum^nas mentes, quod superstitiones ^ustulent, and fortuito ge^^ omnia confirma^t. But I dare not deny the power of particular providence in all the works under the Sun; lest vvith sensuall Epicures, or vvith the secure world I be forced to distribute her heavenly praises, betwixt her enemie fortune in secret, and her handmaid nature in seen second causes. The incomprehensible course of that highest providence in Gods admirable vvisedom to the foot of vvhose chair the highest link of the chaine of second causes is fast tied) hath made the great changes of states, whether of Kirkes or Commonwealthes to be sensible by concurring signes, as it hath been ordinarie in all time, by observation and record of these vvorks of God, to giue warning to the vveak agents of great actions, touching the great God in his honour and men in their happinesse, to try themselues vvhether in their proceedings they haue vvalked dutifully with the convoy of truth going before, and with wisdome at the one hand and charity at the other, that so they may either rejoyce or repent, or at least be co^vinced against that day of the rightous judgme^t of God. When the

controversi^ vvas betwixt Cyrillus and N^storius, vvhich by many K^^k men in the cast favouring Nestorius part, vvas counted (...) a ^^a^l^ about vvords, especially by Acacius, vvho called Cy^^llus (...) precise in termes. And vvhen that Controversie vvas to be decreed by the Councell of Ephesus, upon certaine signes and presages of hard successe, this verse vvas ordinarie in the mouthes of men.


(...),
(...).


For when mischiefe hangs over the Kirk,
Then signes like these begin to work.


And Machiavel him selfe agreeth to the generall, de Repub l. 1. c. ^6 through force of experience in the mutations of States, but he neither can finde out the cause, nor make any good use of the particulars.


Archip.
Ye know both the truth of the generall, and the true cause thereof, and therefore let me know the particular.


Epaph.
Vpon that last day of the Parliament before foure houres after noone, vvhen all the Actes vvere now concluded, and mens hearts vvere insulting upon the Defenders, glorying in their own vvittie counsels, rejoycing in their great success^, gaping for great thankes and reward, and wishing every one he vvere the first reporter, that he might be carver of his own praise, as if he had recovered the Kingdom of Bohemia and the Palatinat: The Lord Commissioner rising from his throne, for ratifying all that vvas done by touch of the Scepter, vvas trysted by the God of heaven. For at the verie moment of that ratification, the heavens send in through the vvhole vvindowes of the house an extraordinarie great lightning: after the first a second more glancing; and then a third most terrible of all. Immediately after the lightnings, an un^outh and extraordinarie darkenes, for the suddennesse and greatnesse therof astonishing all, and couching the insolent joyes of some. The lightning, vvere seconded vvith three lou^ blasts of thunder, in sound and short continuance of every blast like the shot of some Cannon extraordinary great: and were taken by many vvithin the house of Parliament to be shotts from the Castle. It appeared to all that dwelt within ten or twelue miles, that the clowdes stood right aboue the town, and that the darkenesse overshadowed that part onely. By one of the blasts the Beacon standing in the entry of Leith haven vvas beaten down. After the lightnings, darknes and thundering, their fell down a shoure of haile stones extraordinary great, and last of all a strange

raine making the streetes to runne like rivers, imprisoning the Lords about the space of an houre and a halfe, and straitly forbidding to honour these fiue Articles vvith ordinarie pompe and solemnity: So that the servants rode home on the footmantles, and the Masters vvith drew themselues, some by coach and some on foot through the neerest privie wayes. Next, as if the heavens had resolved never to countenance these ill-gotten creatures, upon Munday the 20 of August, vvhen the Act^s vvere proclaimed, the same m^^g^ation vvas renewed by thunder, si^, (...), and great raine, co^^^^ing all the time of the riding at the Crosse: And thirdly, vvhat hath followed since, yee can vvitnesse your selfe. The tempests of vvind and raine b^g^n at that time haue so continued through the u^^outh unseasona^^^nesse of the ^^e harvest in many places. S Luke gat not a st^w^k, and the ^^^ne, universally are shaken, and rotten in such measure that never was there in this Country such it equality of ^ri^es in (...) short time; never greater feare of famine, and vvant of ^^ed to s^^ the ground for the next crop. It is pittifull to remember (if it could be forgotten so long as there is a Kirk in Scotland) the impetuous inundations of vvater carrying away vvith their violen^e not onely cornes, cattle, and bridges, but houses, plenishing people and all. Perth hath good reason to call to mind the month of May, the yeare 1591, vvherein by certaine commissioners they confessed to the Generall Assembly, their rash and suddain receiving of the apostat Lords, troublers of Kirk and Kingdome, and promised never to giue su^h occasion in time comming, but to assist and maintaine the Kirk of God, and the true Religion presently professed vvithin th^^ Realme, as at more length is contained i^ the^^ own confes^ion. From the months of March 1^^6, and August 1618, vvherein r^s^e^^^ vvas both begun and c^ncluded that unhappie cha^ge, wh^ i^ hath been and is a cursed mother of many miseries to this Kirk and Kingdome: unto vvhich howsoever they were disposed, it vvas openly spoken in the publi^k meeting that they were inclinable. And if it were so, they (...) as farre from their first prom^s^ as th^y inclined to that alt^^ation. Item, Item the moneth of Octob. 1621 vvherein the (...) and rumbling of vvaters, and fear and danger vvithin their (...) sends them to seek their safety by the losse of their fa^^ and ^^^ly bridge, vvith such affection as the merchant casts his goods in the sea, or the owner runnes his ship on ground for safety of mens l^ues: The Lord had an eye to the teares of their sorrow, and h^ard their cryes; from the depths he releeved and saved them, and they stand his debters of thems^lues for their great redemption, and that wonderfull deliverance. And likewise the town of Berwick did

see the unresistable rage of Tweed, by whose violence was hurled away, not onely their ancient vvodden bridge, but that new and strong one sinely builded of stone, no lesse destinate to beare that honourable remembrance: Hoc uno ponte duo regna conjunxi. Deus diu conjuncta cons^rvet, then to be a common servant to the North and South parts of this Iland. It is moreover pittifull to heare the lamentation of vvidowes, children and friends at home, for the l^sse of their deere husbands, loving fathers, and trustie and tender friends by sea, and specially in those townes that are most z^alous to follow novelties in religion: and also pittiful to remember the great regrat of Borgh and Land for vvant of fewel to prepare their meat and drinke, and refresh their persons against the injuries of the vehement cold. And yet few strikes upon the thigh, and askes why are all these things come upon us? But for further humiliation, the Lords hands is yet stretched out, to see if any vvill repent and returne. For before the vvearisome end of this unseasonable harvest, and the vvheat seed, which farre by the ordinarie custome of this Country, vvas not begun in December, there is come on a heavie Winter, vvith great hunger and cold, striking all that haue fore sight vvith feare, and care to ease themselues of such persons as they may spare, and to liue as retired as possible they can; and daily increasing pittifull cryes, not onely of vagabond beggars, but of many honest persons, who if they had employment as before were able to succour themselues by the fruit of their labours. What the spring and summer following may bring forth of such beginnings it is hard for us to inquire,(...). Read Euseb. l. 9. cap. 7. and after him Niceph. l. 7, cap. 28. Rules for reducing the iudgements of God to their own proper causes. and best for all, To watch and pray, to be zealous and amend, and to resolue to exercise their patience and charitie, as the Lord hath measured unto them.


Archip.
I know that the providence of God ruleth, and the fin of man procureth all judgements and afflictions. And (I thank my God) I haue learned against the Atheisme of the times some rules to direct me how to reduce particular judgements to particular causes, and to father them right upon their owne deserving sinnes. As 1 by denunciation in the word, vvhen I find in Scripture a particular judgement threatned against a particular sinne, I must confesse that I am become so simple, that I ascribe the judgement when it falleth out to that sin as the proper cause: 2 by Retaliation; vvhen the judgement is so like to the sinne that the sin appeareth in the judgement as in a mirrour: 3 by propagation, vvhen sinne in the own nature bringeth forth such a judgement as the birth thereof: 4 by accusation when the conscience upon the comming of the judgement immediately remembreth and convinceth of the same sinne: 5 by deprehension, vvhen the sinner

is taken in the verie act, as a thiefe with the fang. When many or all of these rules concurre in one particular, they leaue no scruple of dubitation in my heart, whether the matter concerne my owne personall case, or the common estate of the Kirk, or Weale-publick. And I doubt nothing, but men separating themselues for that end, might Savanorolalike, by the grace of God disposing them to joyne in their observation the course of the vvord and vvorkes of God, know much more of the procuring and intended causes of the judgements of God, and learne more of him vvho is known by executing judgements then they doe. But to prevent all mistaking my desire is not so much for the present to make particular application of my rules to that vvhich you haue related as to haue satisfaction to the third of my Demands according to my proposition,Third Demand. and your promise in the beginning.

Archipp.
All that I vvould say is this Seeing the controverted cer^monies are not matters of faith, but in th^^r nature s^eme to be in^^fferent, are now ^on^luded in Kirk and Parliament, upon so religious and reasonable pretences, suffi^ient promises given that no further should be urged upon the Kirk hereafter, and looking upon all second causes, no hope of the restitution of our former order, but all appearance that this course shall prevaile, what shall be done? Were it not good to make a vertue of necessitie? And is it not better after due testification of our zeale to our ancient liberty, and of our misliking of the present course, for our short time either vvillingly to receiue, or patiently to tollerate that vvhich we cannot m^n^, then to striue vvith our Superiours, trouble the peace of the Kirk g^ue place to the common adversarie, carie th^ infamous n^^es of S^hisme and Puritanisme: and, vvhich we must respect also, hazard Ministerie, living, liberty, and all? There it is.
Foure p^incipall difficult^es answered.If you hau^ no more to say (as I see not vvhat can be said more by the Prelate and Politi^ian both) I perceiue that you stand upon the diffi^ult^es of ^ppearance, Pretence, Promise and Successe, the foure great enchanters of mankind, and rolling whe^les of def^ction, which I will labour to silence by the truth, and ^ogge in their impetuous course by the resistance of solide reason.



Archip.
My first and greatest diffi^ultie is Appearance: for they fr^m to me and to the m^st part, ^o be no matters of faith, but things meerly indiff rent.


Ep^^h
It is a happy thing ^hat the thoughts and words of men bring no chang^ upon the ver^^^s of G^^.1 Diff^culty, Appearance of indifferencie. Had we been these seven yeares ^^st like the s^ven sl^^^ing Martyrs of Ni^epho^us in the time of De^ius, this ^in of in ^^ff^^^n^ i^ which de^ives us ^ow, had ma^e us to ^hink that we had (...) her been wakned in another world, or else that we had mistaken our grounds, when we learned, that matters were the rules of mens min^^; and that the errors of m^n could doe no harme to the truth of God. All the operations of the mind of man, his cognos^ing, fa^^^ing, apprehending, dedu^^ing, concluding, etc. although fortifi^d by can^ns, customes, and lawes, are no of that force. For when the mind of man goeth astray from the truth, he incountreth the shadow in place of the substance. Ieroboam in his time, and his followers imagined, that they worshipped not the cal^es, but Iehovah in a sensible signe: yet their worship was in seed presented not to Iehovah, vvho was not so much as conceived by them, but to Divels. He that conceiveth a round ca^ to be squared, conceiveth not in his minde a circle, but angles; and the cap remaineth the same that it was before.


Archip.
To what purpose insist you in that vvhich all men admit?


Epaph.
To answer your seeming and appearance: although ye and all others should think, and authoritie both intend and iudge the matters in hand to be indifferent in the exercise of religion; yet they are not for all that indifferent. Sitting at the communion is the same now in nature that it was, when it was sworne to bee most convenient to the institution: and kneeling is no better this year then at the time of reformatio^, when it had not the boldnes to bide behind Idolatry. The Yu^le preaching hath no more pietie, albeit the Christmas pye make it more pleasant then before. Albeit these bee the dreggs of times and manners transforming things good into evill, e^ill into good, and both into indifferent: veritie into heresie, and heresie into veritie, and both into phantasie, that few things s^^me as they are, or be as they seeme: yet veritie carrying th^ image of God, is still vnchangeable, and in the middest of the mask^s of whoorish errors, hath such maiestie in her presentation, that vvith the one of her eyes she ravisheth the hearts of her lovers, and with the other disdaineth all the courters of carnall sense, her deadly enemies.


Archip.
If either naturall or supernaturall verities had depended upon opinion, we would neither know nor beleeue any thing

at all. But I would know of you first, how men are brought to this opinion of indifferencie, if the things themselues bee not indifferent.


Epaph.
Three waies wherby men are brought to the opinion of indifferencie.Some men come to it at the first; while they stay their mindes from judging that to be a matter of difference, which they heartily wish were indifferent. Even as many stay their mindes, so farre as they can, from thinking that to bee true, which they vvish were false. They cannot doe a thing unlawful, but they can judge a thing unlawfull to be indifferent, and so doe a thing indifferent. Others there bee, vvho bring on their mindes by degrees. As in Atheisme men are first Godlesse in conversation, having the forme of godlinesse but denying the power thereof, and living as without God in the world. Next, they become Atheists in affection, vvishing that there were not an infinite iustice to bee revenged vpon their vvickednesse. At last the Lord giveth them over to Atheisme in opinion, that they say in their hearts, There is not a God. So may I say of Adiaphorisme, and iudging of indifferencie, many at the first are brought to practise without consideration. Afterward finding themselves wrong, but either for feare of shame or skaith, refusing to follow the retrait of their conscience, they wish in affection that they were not matters of faith. In the end, the mistresse being vowed by the hand-maid, understanding is set on worke to finde out probabilities, colours and appearances, to make them to seeme indifferent. Observe particular practises, and ye shall finde it to be so.


Archip.
These indeed are the methods of earthly wisedome. Vpon the contrary by heavenly order the truth comming from aboue, shineth first in the minde by her light, sendeth down her heat to the heart, and then in knowledge and zeale ruleth the outward action. But whatsoever bee the vvayes of mens vvits, thinke yee indeed, that the things in question are matters of faith, and not indifferent, I vvould not vvish you to be singular.


Epaph.
A peremptory answer I perceiue vvould chase you away: I shall let you see my reason, before I tell you my opinion: first, of matters of faith, and then of things indifferent. If yea joyne vvith mee, I vvill bee no more singular, at least in your estimation: And I nothing doubt to bring you, and all such as will giue place to the truth, to be of my opinion, be upon what side they will.


Archip.
There is nothing I desire more to heare: vvhat haue you then to say of the first, vvhether they bee matters of faith



Epaph.
It is a sound and received distinction, that matters of faith are not all of one kinde,Three degrees of maners of faith. but stand in three degrees of difference. There be some things of the foundation of faith, somethings vpon the foundation, and some things about the foundation. The first sort toucheth the life and soule of Christian religion: and thus the Articles of the Creed are accounted matters of faith. The second is of their necessarie attendants, by cleare and undenyable consequence following the former at the heeles: so that no man perswaded of the former first principles, can haue any hesitation almost concerning these. And the third is extended to all things revealed in Scripture concerning whatsoever purpose although most indifferent in it selfe. There is nothing of so meane importance written in the word, but it must bee ranked among the matters of faith, how soone it is manifested to bee of divine authoritie. Neither can hee haue any faith at all, who hath not faith of all that hee knoweth to bee written.


Archip.
No man will deny that: for I haue learned,Quaedam nec sum necessaria cre^^tu per se nec per authoritate^ scripturae quaedam necessaria per se and per authoritatem scripturae, quaedam necessaria creditu non per se sed per authoritatem scriptura. that as there be some things neither necessarie of themselues to be beleeved, nor by the authoritie of Scripture; some things that are necessarie both wayes, so there be many things necessary to be beleeved not of themselves, but by authority of scripture. But what is that to the purpose.


Epaph.
I haue heard great men say, They are no matters of salvation, that is to say, they are not of the first degree of matters of faith, and therefore not to bee much respected, as neither helping nor hindering our happinesse. But consider I pray you this second ground, and compare it with the former, that according to the three forenamed degrees of matters of faith without, there bee answerably within the minde of man as many degrees of damnable infidelitie, these are Ignorance, Error, and Obstinacie: Ignorance of matters of faith of the first degree, condemneth: for whether amongst professors,And accordingly three degrees of infidelitie. or without the limits of the visible Kirk, he that knoweth not the principles of Christian religion, cannot be saved. Error in the second, bringeth condemnation, because he who denieth that which followeth by necessary consequence upon the principles of religion, hath not knowledge of the principles themselues; He that denieth the consequent, denieth also the antecedent, albeit he should professe that hee cannot see the necessity of consequence.


Archip.
I doubt of that: for may not I know many grounds without knowledge of the conclusions, which may bee even by necessary consequence deduced from them, because I never had occasion perhaps to think upon them.



Epaph.
Therefore I say not that Ignorance, but Error of matters of the second sort is damnable. And that he who after consideration denieth the consequent, denieth the antecedent. The Iew making confession, vvith the fathers, of his faith in the Messiah, but denying that the Messiah is come, doth indeed deny the Messiah. The Anabaptist, professing that he beleeveth in Christ, but denying him to haue taken flesh of the virgin, doth indeed deny the Mediator. Al (...) the Papist avouch, that hee is sound in the doctrine of Christs person and offices, yet by consequent hee denyeth both, and may look for Anathema (...) preaching another Gospell. He that sweareth the king to be h^s Soveraigne, and denieth him lawful obedience, cannot be excused by pretending, that he seeth not the necessitie of consequence. And he that admitteth the princely office of Christ, but vvill giue no place to his r^yall scepter, neither in his owne heart, nor in the government of the kirk, but putteth a crowne of thornes upon his head, and in his hand a ^eed, will be attained of treason against the king of glory, and vvill bee iudged an usurper of his incommunicable dignitie.


Archip.
It is now evident, and I cannot but thinke worse of such false friends, then of avowed adversaries. Albeit I would professe that if I wer ministring the Lords supper, yet it is but my imagination, except I keepe the Lords institution, 1 Cor. 11.20. But come to the third degree, of infidelitie.


Epaph.
^^^na domi^a non est, ^^si que le^it^me i^ ^xta instiu^onem dominica^ obser^^tur. Pa^^us.In the third kind of matters of faith, neither Ignorance nor Error, but obstinacie, bringeth condemnation. We are all ignorant of many things, but vve must know the articles of faith. We all erre in many things, but we must be free of error about the necessarie consequents of these articles, and free of obstinacie in the meanest matters. S^, that as it is not Ignorance, but Error in the second sort that condemneth, so it is not error simply, but obstinacie in the third sort, and Ignoranti^ pra^e dispositionis that condemneth. No man beleeveth expresly all matters of saith. No Christian but he carrieth a minde prepared and ready to yeeld to all matters of faith, how soone they appeare in Scripture. In this third kind, m^n may sinne very ^ang^rously of obstinacie, as in the second of Error, and in the first of Ignorance. Albeit before men, the greatnesse of the injurie bee esteemed for the most part, by the obiect;^a^tia personae su p^et ^mp^^tatem (...). before God the qualitie of the doer, and maner of doing aga^egs the sinne, no lesse th^n the substance of the deed. Paul his eating of flesh may be a great guiltinesse as well as his persecution. Remember the hoove of Moses, Daniels meat, and the opening of his window, Mordecai his pre^senesle, Eleazars morsel, Pauls houre and appearance of evill, Christ Rac^, his rite of washing

of hands, Ismaels laughing, etc. The smallest matters, the least gestures, the shortest time, the meanest appearance of evill, which are mole-hills in the worlds estimation, may be mountains in the eyes of God, especially being found in some persons, and done after a certaine manner. The warning, Be ye holy as I am holy, is most frequent in Leviticus a book of ceremonies; which both giveth comfortable assurance that God will accept of our services in the least duties; and teacheth also, that true holinesse, the perfect paterne whereof he pointeth at in his own holines, extendeth it selfe to the care of the smallest rites.


Archip.
I must confesse by your discourse and examples, that it is so. But I see not the reason, wherefore it should be so: how can so mean matters be capable of so great guiltinesse?


Epaph.
A natural Naaman would speak so of the whole rites of Christian religion, of the very substance of both sacraments. But I vvould wish you to thinke that as in matters fundamentall; so also in rituall there bee three sorts of sinne; one of Ignorance, the cause wherof is in the mind: another of Infirmitie comming of the affections: and the third of obstinate maliciousnesse rooted in the will. No man but he sinneth daily in things indifferent of Ignorance, not knowing them to be indifferent: No man but he sinneth frequently of Infirmitie in things indifferent, miscarried with some passion or temptation but who against engyring light doth sinne obstinately in the least jot of that unalterable veritie, can you deny but hee sinneth heynously in a matter of faith. The enforced ceremonies may seeme small to our adversaries, because they bring small reason for them, and may seeme to bee no matters of faith, because they bring no word of faith for them; yet the matters vvherewith Christ charged the Scribes and Pharisees, were not so great. I haue often observed in my experience, That a little leav^ sowreth the whole lumpe; and I know by my owne heart, That a narrow faith makes a roome conscience.


Archip.
Shew me then how a man shall behave himselfe, that he faile not in matters of faith?


Epaph.
It is a good distinction of faith,How every one shall be kept from fa^^ing in matters of faith. that is observed by Lombardus out of Augustine. There is one faith vvhereby vve beleeue: another faith which vve beleeue. In respect of the one, all our actions especially in the vvorship of God, and more specially such of them as are controverted and called in question, must bee matters of faith. Hee that doubteth is damned if hee eat, because hee eateth not of faith. In respect of the other, whatsoever is prescribed in the word, is a matter of faith, whether it be ceremony or substance: whether expresly or by consequent,

whether in the particular or in the generall.Fides quae creditur ducat fidem qua^ creditur. Now right order requireth, that the faith which I beleeue, be the leader of the faith, whereby I beleeue; otherwise this will bee a faithlesse faith, and proue effectlesse in the end. As the order of Nature is; Matters,Res conceptus voces. Verbu^ fides, en ^us. Though^s, Words, so the order of the kirk is; Scripture, Faith, Worship. I^ (...) the first Axiome of our profession, and the best rule for our dir^ction, That the S^^^^ture is the one^y Canon of all things belonging to religion, and the onely judge of all controversies. All which shall be more cleare, w^^n we s^^^ke of indifferencie the other branch of your appearance.


Archip.
D^ctrine of th ngs indifferent ob^cure.As Archim^des tombe, when Cicero came to visite it, was all overgrow^^ with th^^ (...), so seemeth the matter of indifferencie to me; no^h^ng more talked of, nothing lesse knowne. We are all in time, ^la^e, motion, etc. yet the nature of time, place, motion, is so all digested after so manifold assayes, that it gaue occasion to one ^o say, That they hau^ so many bones, that the Philosoph^rs are like to wi^rie on them, and haue need of cranes to pluck them out of their throats. All our senses and wits are exer^ised about things indiff rent: and yet so ignorant of the nature and vse of things indiff^rent, that the wittiest that I haue h ard or read, are like the Fox in the Fable li^king onely the outside of the glasse, but never comming to the meat within: wherof if it hath been your happines to taste, I beseech you call me to the banket.


Epaph
What wiser will ye be, when I haue told you the Scholastik distinction of Indifferentia Identitati^ in things altogether coincident, Indifferentia communitatis of things generall in respect of their particulars, Receptionis, of the matter in respect of the diversitie of formes;Indifferencie taken in a th^efold sen e. Aliq^^d d^citut Adiaphora^ sive indiffere^s ^ribas modis. 1 Comparat^ve and per ^^ationem. 2 Effective et per cons quentia^ 3 Subiective et formaliter. actionis in respect of this or that particular action; and have out of their smokie subtilties discoursed vpon them severally, when I haue deaved you with Puel, Meisnerus, and many moe, their rul^s, their restrictions, and ampliations, yee will esteeme them all but shelles, and not kirnels: and so will depart as hungry as yee came. And therefore to l^aue them to themselves, and not to bee nice with you about the word of Indifferencie, brought rather from Athens or Rome, then from Ierusalem, would you tune your care a little to our common phrase, yee may obserue, that we call a thing Indifferent in a threefold sense: First by comparison or relation of one thing to another. Secondly, in respect of the effects and consequents that it hath. And thirdly, a thing is indifferent in the owne nature and qualitie; beside which three wayes we use not to name any thing indifferent. I will cleare them unto you orderly.



Archip.
Ye haue need: for that popular indifferencie of yours seemeth to mee as obscure as the other Scholasticke indifferencie, And first what call ye the Relatiue indifferencie, or indifferent by comparison.


Epaph.
Any thing is called of us indifferent in the first sence,1 Comparativ^ and pe^ relationem indifferens. vvhen it is taken with comparison or relation to the maine or superlatiue extremes, as that which albeit it bee good, is not best; or albeit it bee evill, is not worst; albeit it bee verily good or verily evill, yet is neither very good nor very evill,1 By comparison indifferent. but so par^^^^pateth of evill, that wee know a worse of that kind, or so part^^^pateth of good, that we know a better of that kind. And you may perceiue, that whosoever speaketh this, as the most part do, vnwittingly presupposeth two grounds: one is, that comparison bee made betwixt two things accidentall of one and the same kinde for ^hat which is a meane betwixt best and worst, must ag^^e with them in all things, wherein they agree betwixt themselves, and whatsoever is common to both extreames, must be common also to the m^ane. Thus we use to say, that a pearle is indifferent great, and that a hill is indifferent small; yet meaning, that it is neither the greatest nor smallest pearle, neither the highest nor lowest mountaine.


Archip
That is true; and so it runneth in our daily use through all the ca^ g^^^es of a ^^ents, indifferent, great, good, like, unlike, learned, actiue, neere, early, decent, etc. But what is the other suppos^ (...)?


Epaph
The other ground is, that the comparison be made, and the relation b^ understood according to the bounds of our knowledge, and experience For we speak of the extreames according to our knowledge, and so must we of the meane, when wee call any thing great, ^st we meane greatest in our knowledge, and so when we say indifferent great.


Archip.
What is that indifferencie for our purpose?


Epaph.
I wish it were lesse in our practise, it is nothing else in matters of religion but luke-warmnesse. For in this sence the present constitution of the kirke of England, hath been and is reputed by many of her owne most loving children, labouring zealously for her further reformation, to bee indifferent and luke-warme, her government, her ceremonies indifferent. This indifferencie or medio^ritie is not here as in morall habits, where both extreames swarving from the golden vertue, in excesse and defect, are sinfull and vitious: But here the one extreame is the matter of commendation, as being the onely excellencie, which the coldnesse and luke-warmnesse cannot climb unto. Such a mediocritie as Solon could not tolerate in Athens, as the

king Tullus Hostilius punished proportionally in Metius Suffetius that Adiaphorist at Rome.Qui quod ex praescripto soedevis ad bell^ ^our^ale^ vo^^^us eun tibus in hoste^ Ro^^^us suos praelio ^luxerat iussu Tulli duabus admotus quadrig^s discerptus e^t. Liv^u^. Such Adiaphorists vvere some of the Princes of Gods people, neither of the best sort still pousing reformation, nor altogether Idolatrous and Apostaticall, but subverting Baal and reteining the Calves of Dan and Bethel, abolishing Idolls, but not demolishing the high places. It was this Indifferencie that ruled Pilates policie, vvhen hee resolved to scourge I^sus Christ for saving his life. In our times goodnesse is growen so s^ant, that we ^ut him who is after this sort indifferent in some degree of goodnesse; and at least call him no ill man, vvho doth not all the evill hee may; there is vvorse then hee, and that is all. In this comparatiue sence, kneeling in the act of receiving the communion, is not a gesture in different, nor (as wee use to speake) midway, except wee take ^^^way for wallaway himselfe,Controuerted ceremonies are not indifferent in the first sence. or his neerest kinsman. For howbeit generally there bee many things worse, as the opinion it selfe of reall presence; yet making the comparison amongst things of the same kinde, there is amongst gestures of communicants, according to the one supposition, and speaking so farre as we know any gesture to bee used in the Sacrament, as it was secondly persupponed, I conclude, that of all gestures kneeling (as most Antichristian) is the worst, sitting, as most convenient to Christs owne institution, is the best; and standing neither best nor worst, but indifferent, or midway.


Archip.
Yee haue cleared that sufficiently. At the reformation of a Kirke it is a sinne not to change kneeling into siting; At the first plantation of a kirke it is a greater sinne to make choyce of kneeling, and not of sitting; but the greatest sinne, and a degree of defection, is to change sitting into kneeling, that is to leaue the best, and take the worst of all gestures. But come now to the second sort of Indifferencie.


Epaph.
2 Effective et per consequentiam indifferens.Secondly, a thing is sayd to bee indifferent in respect of the effects and consequents that follow upon it, as that which doth neither good nor evill, helpe nor harme, but for any knowne sequell may bee done or left undone. Thus fooles who see not farre before them,2 By consequent indifferent. thinke many things indifferent, which wise men know to bee evill or good. In this sence many things may bee indifferent to the body, which are pernicious or profitable to the soul, indifferent externally, and internally materiall; indifferent physically and morally, but good or evill civilly; indifferent all these wayes, but evill spiritually: finally, indifferent every vvay at one time, in one person and place; but

at another time, in another person and place evill every way. Wherin everie man judgeth according to his own estimation and apprehension of the particular good or evill that commeth neerest unto him. And the most part are inve^gled with their own selfe-loue sophistication. It is neither good nor evill for me,A secundum quid ad simpliciter. therefore not at all. The penny wise worldling thinketh the change of Religion more indifferent then the taxing of usurie. He will not giue a penny betwixt the best and worst of that, which taketh nothing out of his purse, which serveth nothing for augmentation nor diminution of the rentall, a booke that he studyeth more then the Bible. The Epicurean loveth festivall daies because they are far, and counteth in his Kalender all fasting daies for dismall. He that would be great, and aimeth to be the onely figure among ciphers, vvill haue every thing in Kirk and Policie indifferent, that signifieth not something to him. The saucie Cynick sitting Dictator like in his Cloister, vvhere he studyeth bookes and not men, gybeth at all, and vvith his master Diogenes idly tumbleth his tub, vvhen his town is turmoil. Every man rolling his thoughts vvithin his own sphere, and making himselfe the miserable center, disdaineth ^ilk thing in Kirk and Common wealth that is Eccentrick; thinketh upon nothing lesse then Religion in matters of Religion, and upon any good or evill more, then upon spirituall good or evill in matters spirituall.


Archip.
Whether thinke ye the controverted Ceremonies may be called indifferent in the second sense?


Epaph.
Some men haue found them vvell profitable.They are not indifferent in the seco^d sense. But for my selfe I thinke, to remoue this indifferencie from them vvould require at my hands more vvords then vvit; and from you rather sense then reason. Beside the doolefull complaints of the Ancients, resounded by so many late Divines, vvishing in one heart and voice that the matter of contention vvere removed. Besides the deep and drowned sighes of Hooker himselfe, both in his own and Nazianzens vvords: besides M. Sprint his first tables and ceremoniall bickerings, vvith his palinod and necessity of recantantion (for so was it with him) in case of deprivation, and beside the late speech of the Kirk our Mother, daily experience of evill spirituall to the most, of evill naturall, oeconomicall, civill, and Ecclesiasticall to the best, may let you see a world of evils issuing from them.


Archipp.
It will be said, that all these millions of miseries, which no man can deny haue entred vvith the ceremonies, follow upon them onely by accident, and that it is not their nature to beget so bad effects.


Epaph.
He is not vvorthy of his hire, that can say nothing for

them. Whether the evils be naturall and necessarie consequents, let the observed universality in mixing of mans inventions with Gods institution beare witnesse, that whatsoever hath been either brought in or maintained in the Kirk of God without warrant from himselfe, hath ever proved like the brasen serpent and Gedeons Ephod.Specificative and Reduplicative. The ornaments by the Philistimes added to the Ark, albeit they vvere gold, vvere but mi^e and emerandes. It is tragically felt and more to be feared, that ceremonies shall proue in our Kirk such woodb^nd to the wo^ship, as Ministers haue found the dignity of Bishops to themselues, no withstanding all their faire promises, who, as it is seen through the land, doe beare them down as he great barren ashes doe the small fruitfull trees growing neere unto them: and as the fa^ festivall daies make the fasting daies vvhich are next unto them the leanest in all he yeare. But I hast to the third and last signification, as the more principall and the most proper.


Archip.
And I long to heare it; for in the former two the question is not great.


Epaph.
3 Subiective et formaliter indiffer^ns. 3 By nature indifferent in 2 sensu (...) In 3 sensu (...)In the third sense things are said to be indifferent, which considered in themselues are neither good nor evill, as not inclining to the one side more ^hen the other of their own nature: but equally in^lnable and alike readie to be inclined to either by supervenient determination. And therefore a^ in the second sense they are called things s^rving nothing either f r happinesse or miserie; so in this last sense they are called things in our power, the middes betwixt extremes That yee may the more exactly take up their nature, yee must learne to distinguish betwixt a naked action, and an action cloathed vvith circumstances. Inter a^um nudum sive praecisum a circumstantiis and actum circumstantionatum.


Archip
Tea^h me ^ow to distinguish betwixt them?


Epaph
For the first: All our thoughts, speeches, and actions, as they lye before our eyes in their own nature, before they be defined, v^ste^ wi^h conditions and circumstantiate, are morally indifferent: our apprehension, our reasoning, our remembring, our beleeving, our l^ue, hope, joy hatred, feare, griefe, or speaking and uttering,Distinction betwixt naked actions and actions clothed with circumstances. all these by word, writ, gesture or labouring, resting, eating, ^^^nking, standing, sitting, lying, kneeling, and vvhatsoever else is the operation or exercise of any power of the soule or bodie, vvithin or vvithout, nakedly considered and without all limitation are as yet indifferent, neither good nor evill, but may be good, and may be evill; and how farre they happen to be determined, as much they loose of their indifferencie, inclyne towards the extremee, and become good or evill. Thus all things

are indifferent. For the second:(...) est dei solius, creaturae omnes etiam dignissimae in rebus omnibus etiam indignissimis imperi^ and pr^videntiae sub^iciuntur. As all those naturall faculties and functions forenamed, are of God, through God, and for God, so is it his soveraignty to set down their marches for their morall or spirituall determination, to make them good or evill. Neither can any created power make that vvhich is good to be evill, that which is evill to be good, that which is indifferent to be good or evill; except upon the supposall of Predetermination from him vvho is the Maker and Lord of all. Except man had his being of himselfe, and a vvorld of his own making, his determinations could not be absolute or uncontrouleable in the meanest matters. And thus upon the contrary nothing is indifferent, as shall be more manifest afterward.


Archip.
All the matter I see stands in that divine determination. Would ye make it plaine how by vertue thereof things lay aside their indifferencie, and become good or evill, the light would be greater.


Epaph.
This divine determination (vvhich is indeed the principall part of our theame) so farre as it concerneth your intention is threefold; the first may be called Morall and Vniversall;Three sorts of divine determination removing the indifferencie of things. the second Ceremoniall and Nationall; and the third Evangelicall and Christian.


Archip.
I beseech you hast not, but goe through them in order, and stay upon every one of them, till I be in some measure satisfied. Now first vvhat call yee that Morall and Vniversall Determination?


Epaph.
It is to be found in the ten Commandements of the Morall Law,1 Determination morall. as they are an transumpt or rather an extended copie of the Law of nature given to man in the beginning from that first patterne of the law eternall: And afterward framed for mans estate since his fall and restitution, as it is expressed and exponed by Moses and the Prophets, but vvithout any nationall respect to the people of the Iewes.


Archipp.
I would haue you to apply this determination, that I may conceiue how it removeth the naturall Indifferencie of things.


Epaph.
This law of the eternall God directs and commands all the foresaid faculties, functions and actions, inward and outward, to th^^r right objects and ends, affecteth them vvith their inseparable accidents, and clotheth them vvith their unchangeable circumstances; in such sort, that the action good, by this law can never be made evill; that vvhich is evill by this law can never be made good; that vvhich is good or evill by this Law can never be made indifferent. For example; by vertue of this determination, the knowledge of God, faith in God, hope in God, joy in God,

Loue of God, etc. are unchangeablie good: Distrust, hatred of God are unchangeable evils. The true vvorship of God, good; Idolatry, and vvhatsoever is idolatrous evill. Both killing and kneeling (offend not I pray you for it cannot be denyed) vvhich nakedly considered vvere indifferent by the authority of this law according to the objects,Occidere hominem quod est idem secu^dum speciem naturae potest ordinari sicut in fin^m, ad conservationem justititae and ad satisfaciendum irae. Et ne hoc erunt diversi actus secundum speciem m^ris quia uno modo erit actus v rtutis, al^o modo erit actus viti^. Thom. 12 41 art. 3. ends, and conditions, are made unchangeably good or evill.


Archip.
The danger is great I perceiue in the application: For if I passe that for indifferent, vvherupon the Lord hath before passed his determination to be good or evill, I fall into the transgression of the law of God, and under his curse: and therfore I would heare more of that Application.


Epaph.
Two observations for sound applicatio^ of the first determination. Circumstan^ae vel accidentia fixita^ti momenti sunt ut penes illa peccatum judicetur id quod agitur. Pet. Martyr Lo^. Com. p. 347. Humani actus non solum ex object^s verum ex circumstantus boni vel mali dicuntur. Thom. 2.2 qu. 18. art. 3. Quando circumstantia res^^icit ordinem actionis pro vel contra ex tali circumstantia censt^uitur allqua species mora is actus in bonitate vel ma^itia, Ibid. art. 10. Ipsae Circumstantiae interdum constituunt rerum earum quae aguntur speciem, ex qua res sive actiones nostrae di^u^tur bonae aut malae. Nam quae v^s simpliciter and per^ bonae sunt eae inter^u^ malae fiunt circumstantus: est tempus quo res bona aut indifferens redditur mala, quia intempe^tiva est: similiter de lo^o and instrumentis. Iunius de P^^t. M^ssis c. 7. thess. 34.For that end I giue you two Observations, vvithout vvhich it can never be sound. One is, that the Accidents or Circumstances of a morall or spirituall action are of the same essence, and substance thereof. The squarest Conformitant shall either proue a praecisian heere in standing upon circumstances, or else quit his conformity vvith the law of God. The circumstances of persons vvill make fornication, adulterie, incest; the circumstance of place, sacriledge; of time the profanation of Sabboth etc.


Archip.
I vvill never think it strange then, that the observation of one day is good service to God, and the observation of another is will worship and superstition: that the circumstance of a private person, or a Midwife; the circumstance of a private place where the Congregation is not assembled; the removall of a table; the taking away of Sacramentall distribution, the hurting of Sacramentall fraction etc. doe alter the substance of the ministration of the Sacrament of Baptisme, or of the Lords Supper. That kneeling in one action be pious, in another action at another time be idolatrous. Circumstance will make an action otherwise

laudable to be laesae majestatis; and he that can swallow a Camel in the matters of God vvithout an hoast, vvill straine a gnat in the circumstances of his own affaires, as though they vvere all substance. What is your second observation?


Epaph.
That the ten commandements be not taken literally, as ten vvords, but largely as Christian Pandects and commonheads of all morall duties toward God and Man, to be exponed and extend^d according to the commentary of the Prophets, Christ, and the Apostles in the old and new testament, according to the perfection of the large law of God, vvhich commands every du^y and forbiddeth every sin: So that, whatsoever is co^manded or forbi^^e^ in the whole word is co^tained here and contrary to the sinistrous glosses of naturall men, the least degree of every sin is censured under the name of the highest degree and grossest of that kind: Vnadvised anger is murder. All vvh^ch (vvhich I vvould haue you to obserue) may be reduced to three heads. Some are so naturally evident that none is found who vvill deny them, as loue to God and our neighbour, vvorship of God etc.Praeceptorum mora ^^m triplex est gradus, n^ quae^am ^^t co^mun^ssima, quaedam v^ro sunt m^gis determinata qu^ (...) ^^ique quorum ratio non est ^u^l be^ n^anis^^^a sid so^^^^ S^^i^^tibus Thom. 12 qu 100 art. 11. The second sort is of such duties and sinnes as may be easily discerned, and yet in this blindfolded estate of man may be unknown or denyed by some, as the particular sins and duties expressed in the severall commandements, and other duties are sinnes like unto them* As perhaps some are ignorant, that they cannot tell vvhich of the commandements forbiddeth drunk^nnesse, gluttony etc There is finally a third sort of such as are not known but by the vvise, through a diligent search of Scripture, as Levit. 14. the rising up before th^ hoary head is to be reduced to the fift commandemant. The abomination of the Nations forbidden in many particulars, D^ut. 18 is to be reduced to the first and second command. All vvhich expositions and determinations are also moral precepts by the force of nature obliging no lesse then the letter of the ten commandements.


Archip.
Every thing that may be reduced to the ten commandements, and that is a determination of the morall Law is not morall: for all the precepts, Ceremoniall and Iudiciall,Ist^ autem ^on, un^ determ nativa praec^ptorum de^a^og^^a vi i^si^iutio^^^, sed e^ vi natu^alis ins^^nctus. Thom. ibid. may and must be reduced thither; and yet they are alterable, as the ceremonies of the Kirk seeme to be.


Epaph.
Ye haue touched that string vvhich hath deceived many even of the learnedest eares. Consider then that the exposition and particular determinations of the morall precepts be of two sorts, some are immediate, and determine by force of the law of nature. Another sort are positiue, and oblige by mediation of another law and force of institution. Had Mr. Sprint sounded this ground he might haue felt that the comparison of Ceremoniall

duties and morall, the one having the force of institution onely, the other of the law of nature, as wel as the rising before the hoarie head, the one mediately the other immediately commanded, was no sure ground to build his necessitie upon. The ignorance of that thi^^ sort of duties and sinnes extends the bounds of indifferencie beyond her right.


Archip.
I perceiue that every externall thing, vvhich vve call a ceremonie is not of the ceremoniall Law, but many of them be of the law Morall,Both made p^ain in the second commandement. and therefore unchangeable as being sparkles of the light of the law of nature. Make your second observation plaine in some part^cular comman^ement.


Epaph.
The first commandement bidding us haue Iehova onely for our God, forbiddeth the having of no God at all; the sin of Atheist, Psal. 14 the having of strange Gods and not the true, as the Pagans Acts 14 11 12 the having of strange gods with the true, as the Samaritanes 2 King 17 33: the not having of the true God aright, Tit. 1 16. But the second commandement is a more pertinent example, vvhich enjoyning to vvorship the true God according to his vvill, dischargeth all invention and vvil worship. Coloss. 2; all imitation of others vvithout the true Kirk, Lev. 18; all translation of Gods owne ordinances, 1 King. 12: and finally all degrees to the least, all signes, all monuments, meanes, causes, incentives, occasions, provocations, beginnings of evill, hat may tempt o^ induce our hearts, all shew and appearance of any of those evils. And as every precept commands the communion of Saints, to vvin our neighbour, and to furth^r his salvation: so every precept forbiddeth to haue any fellowship vvith the unfruitfull vvorkes of darkenesse, or to be accessorie to other mens sinnes. Whosoever faileth in any of them,Quo ceremoniall loquendi g^nere leg^ imperato ^os tinetur mu ta quae in odio esse vr^ bonis no^^t Apost quarum qua^^um est contagio Insius enim it Ambrosius no^ solum crimen metuit sed conta ionem peccati. Quintum est maula ex peccato. His adde si placet sentum ^ Thess. 5 22 pecuni peccati quamvis a peccato perse a^^nam. Afferentes itaque dederum I^c^bo omnes deos al^ni populi qui erant in ^ann ^ua, and in aure^s quae ^rant in autibus s^^^ ^^s^^ditque ea Iacob sub illa quercu quae prope Schecc^nam crat I^^. in I^^. 22. he faileth not in a ceremoniall (as men vvould haue it) but in a morall dutie. His sin is not a sinne by accident, but in it selfe and most kindly a sin, directly against the law of God. Peter Martyr proveth at length vvhat great evils there be in the occasions of evils, Lo^. com. p. 348. Iunius upon Iude v. 22 recordeth six things detestable to good men, the sixt vvherof is the appearance of evils, albeit in it selfe it be not evill, which he maketh plaine by the example of Jacob, and the like we may see in ^sh^^, Elith, Daniel. Ierome upon Esay sheweth, that by Gods stopping of the Israelites vvay vvith thornes, lest they should returne to their former lovers, that we haue need of a strong fence against Idolatry. All our Divines use this Argument against the Lutheran Images.



Archipp.
Thinke ye that there is a divine determination passed upon the urged Ceremonies, and that they fall in any sort ender the law morall?


Epaph.
I put it our of question. Besides the evill of Scandall,The urged ceremonies transgressions against the first determination of the law Morall. in respect wherof, they be by accident sinnes, and forbidden in the sixt commandement: beside their externall superstition and idolatry, vvhich cannot be denied more then that the glance of the eye, that a gesture or a rash vvord of anger, are Adultery and Murther by Christs own determination. And as to command such glances of the eye, and vvords or gestures of that sort, howsoever they seeme nothing in the eye of the world, were in Gods estimation to command adulterie and murther, and to obey such lawes were to obey men rather then God: so must we judge of authoritie and obedience in the other. I say, besides that, they are many otherwaies transgressions of the second commandement i^ in that th^y are occasions and shewes or appearance of another superstition and Idolatry more grosse and abominable For they are of that kind of evill actions, vvherein there be two evils, one externall, that is seen to be done: another internall imported and signified by that vvhich is done, vvhich also is sometimes done, and sometimes not done, according to the quality of the minde, and secret intention of he door. For if the perill be great, and the doer simple, as vvhen ignorant people kneel at the Sacrament, both the evils concurre. Another not so vvell informed as Peter Iudaizing vvith him and by his example, might haue been indeed as superstitious as any of the Iewes, vvhich he seemed onely to be. And so it falleth out, that there is a double guiltines, both upon the strong and upon the weak. Because they who are strong, fall under the outward transgression, and by their example make the vveak vvho can not distinguish and discern so punctually fall under the inward transgression; vvhen vvith them they are committing the outward: 2 They are transgressions of the second commandment, as they be inventions of man, and vvill worship, or imitations of the enemies of God, and a draught of that wine of Babels fornication wherwith the inhabitants of the earth haue been made drunk, Revel. 17 2, vvherof Gods people ought not to tast at all, I am the Lord your God, after the doing of the land of Egypt wherein yee dwel^ shall yee not doe, Levit. 18. Take heed to thy selfe that thou be not snared by following them, Deut. 12. 3 As translations (at least some of them) of Gods own institutions; Ministers like Gods Ministers, dayes, altars, vestures likewise; the sinne of Ieroboam ordaining a feast like unto the feast in Iudah, 1 King 12 32 wherin the Proverbiall truth holds, that the l^ker the ^se is to man, the more deformed it is. To leaue this first main determination of

indifferencie, let the stretching out of the hand, and bowing of the knee in their nature be equally indifferent, and the one capable of good an^ evill ^s well as the other: yet after determination of both by circumstances from God, if vve condemne the one and command the other, we may condemn murder and command idolatrie, condemn the transgression of the second and command the transgression of the first table.


Archipp.
The Indiff^rencie of th^se ceremonies being taken away by divine determination of the morall law as ye haue made it sensible, all the vvorld cannot mak^ them good or indifferent again. As the fault of the first con^^ction cannot be mended in th^ second nor third, so the errour of the first delib^ration upon th^se matters can neither be cure^ by ^he ca^^on of the Kirk, nor by the law of the Country It vvere good either to recant and vomit them up againe, or else to let them pass^ with the excrements by the dungport. For good nourishment I f^are shall they never proue, but daily more and more the face of the Kirk shall become pale, her knees feeble, and armes vveak, till all her beautie and strength be gone. Your promise and my desire leades you now to the second determination.


Epaph.
Second determ^na^ion ceremonial.The second I called Ceremoniall and Nationall, making things ceremonially good or evill, cleane or uncleane, and therefore to be used or not to be used by the people of the Iewes by reason of divine institution, which before in respect of morall and universall determination were left indifferent, as having nothing intrinsecally in their own nature, or by vertue of inherent circumstances, vvhich might make them good or evill.

If yee intend a comparison of our ceremonies vvith theirs, I would haue the times distinguished, and everie thing considered in the owne time.


Epiph.
They had their conception not onely in Gods purpose, who did foresee from everlasting, what form^ of worship was most convenient for every time, and in himself uncha^geable did change accordingly: but also in the practise of the Patriarchicall Kirk observing the seven precepts of Noah, and Circumcision the

seale of the covenant with Abraham. Next, they had their being in their birth, vvhen the Lord brought his first born from Aegypt, through the wombe of the read sea, and their infancie during the 40 yeares peregrination, and their perfection while they were establish^d at the temple in Canaan: th^y had their death when Iesus their life lied upon the crosse, and ascended unto heaven, leauing them b^h^^d as a dead corps to be buried: and their buriall when th^ Gospell vvas preached through the world,Distinction of the ceremoniall ^aw in 4 periods of time 1 Nun cesse non esse. 2 Necisse esse. 3 Non necesse esse. 4 Necess^ non esse and impossib^le esse. and the Temple his typicall body demolished, under the rubbish whereof they were to be layd without hope of resurrection And so the estate of ceremonies in respect of this second determination, may belaid before your eyes in foure periods of time: 1 before the giving of the law. 2. bef^re the death of Christ, 3. before the destruct^^n of the temple, and 4 from that time to the end of the world. In the first time they were possible, and more then possible, for by their forerunners they were likely to be In the second, time they had a being but mortall; and yet during that time they were necessarie. In the third time they were dead, and no such necessitie that they should be: and in the last time they are deadly, they may not be.


Archip.
Now let me know somewhat more of their estate in every one of these periods. And first before the giving of the Law.


Epaph.
In that first time,Estate of ceremonies before the giuing of the law. as it was not a thing indifferent to the kirk of God to refus^, or to alter any ceremony, which the Lord had sanctified for his worship: no more was it indifferent to institute either by their owne invention, or by imitation of the children of m^n, any rite or ceremony for the vvorship of God: for by so doing they had transgress^d the law morall, or the law of nature, commanding all men vvho haue any sence of a Godhead, to receiue and not to giue rules of vvorship. The holy care of the ol^ Patriarches was to reverence and obey that which they had received, and to attend vpon furth^r r^direction.


Archip.
That was a happy care, and worthy of imitation: but vvhat say you of the Iewish cer^monies betwixt the giving of the law, and the comming of Christ: for during that time, the lavv of ceremonies vvas in her glory.In the time of the law 3 sorts of Iew^sh ceremonies. 1 Div^ne divinae. 2 Divina-humana.


Epaph
In that second time there vvere to be found among the Iewes three divers sorts of observations; The first vvere altogether livine, delivered in particular by Moses from the Lord, either to be shadovves of things to come, or to bee a singular forme of vvorship in the kirk during that tim^. The second sort vvere partly divine, and partly humane, vvhen the generall vvas divine and necessa^y either by the lavv of nature, or by some ceremoniall institution

but the particular left without determination from God, as being in it selfe most indifferent, variable, and therefore difficult, if not impossible to determine by general and unchangeable rule; Then man behoved to determine in the particular, not at his pleasure, but according to the tenor of the law morall; that is, being persuaded that the matter was indifferent; and so having faith for the first condition, hee behoved for the second to rule all by loue, that is, to haue respect to Gods honour, and mans salvation.


Archip.
I think ye can hardly giue examples of this sort; there being nothing in the whole worship left without particular determination.


Epaph.
It is nothing hard; for of this sort were the houres of the morning and evening sacrifice, their synagogues, oratories and places of worship through the land, the outward order of their ordinarie meetings, their course of reading, etc. their pulpit and chaires, the times of fasting (except that one expresse in the law) according to the calamities and occurrences of the kirk; whatsoever was Ecclesiasticall in their forms of mariage and buriall. Some things behoved to be done in the sacrame^t of circumcision, albeit not sacramental, which was not expressed The great multitude of prescribed ceremonies made also a multitude of particular cases to be determined by themselves; That we may say, the moe ceremonies the moe questions; the more determinations, the more to be determined.


Archip
To confesse the truth, all these things behoved to bee done, and yet there is no particular direction for them in Moses law. Which is the third sort of obseruations?


Epaph.
1 Human 2.The third kind were neither meerely divine, nor mixed, but merely humane of mans invention, or at least of mans institution, such were the fastings, oathes, washings, (...), offerings, penance, prayers, Phylacteries, etc. of the Hasidaeans and Pharises, taxed by our Saviour as the commandements of men.


Archip.
What are the differences of good and evill in these three sorts of observations?


Epaph.
Difference of good and evil in three sorts of ceremonies.Ceremonies of the first sort, albeit by the law of nature indifferent, yet by force of divine institution, they become positiuely good. Albeit they were by nature changable, the kirk had no power to change them; all their changes were from their first authour; for some of them were ordained onely for an houre to bee used in an individuall action, as the 4 observations in the first Passover, Exod. 12. Some onely for the time of the Wildernesse, as their altars of earth, and rough stones without degrees, both vvhich vvere changed in Canaan. Some lasted till after the Iudges, that the kingdome was established; some to Salomons time,

some to the captivitie, some to the preaching of the Gospell, and some during the whole time of the policie of the Iewes. It was not lawfull for the Kirk either to to institute new formes, or to recall the old, but still they vvere to wait upon the mouth of the Lord. Ceremonies of the second sort were properly about things indifferent, and adherent circumstances, and were then good when they were institute in faith and loue. Even as the pillar of fire and cloud went before Israel in the wildernesse, and pointed at their encampings; yet the wisedome of Iethro in respect of particular commodities and incommodities, of straits or mountaines, was to them in stead of eyes, Num. 10. The kirk might then as now, giue manifold direction in particulars, but still holding her eye upon her leader. The third sort was alwayes damnable: for albeit the Pharises were counted vvise, 1. Cor. 1.20. Where is the wise, where is the Scribe?(...). There is more in the words of the wise, then in the words of the Law, yet all their wisedome is but leaven in Gods eye, vvhile they teach for doctrines the traditions of men.


Archip.
I think it very necessary to think upon these 3 kinds of observations,Estate of ceremonies before the destruct^on of the temple. vvhile I think upon the estate of the ceremoniall law during the vigor thereof. Now come to the third time, and the estate of ceremonies in it.


Epaph.
All the ceremonies, vvhich continued till the third time, during that time, are by common consent esteemed indifferent, not onely being free of the first morall determination, vvhich they never had nor could haue, but also of the second ceremoniall determination, vvhich they had before the death of Christ.


Archip.
Was it then a thing indifferent for all Christians, vvhether Iewes or Gentiles, to use or not to use the Iewish ceremonies in all places, and after vvhat sort they pleased?


Epaph
God forbid ye should think so. It was not lawfull for the Gentiles to obserue them for the space of an houre, Gal. 2.14.18. and 5.1 1. and 6.12. Act 21.25. The Iewish ceremonies were the same to the Gentiles now, vvhich they were to the Iewes before they vvere institute, and after they were abolished.


Archip
What say you then to the decree of the Councell of Ierusalem? Act. 15.Quapropter recte Apostoli consu^uerunt reciesiae Dei, ut p^^ omnes a violanda priore legis tabula (quod Idola^ria vel pol^uen^ simulacrorum significatur et a violanda poste^r^re, quod item Synecdochice nomine Scortationis p^aec pium est and a violanda ra^rum con^cuntia in rebus adiapheris absi event, quod nomi e^suffecati and sa^grinis su^t declaratum. Iunius de politia Mo^^s. cap. 8. vvas not the observation of legall ceremonies imposed upon the Gentiles at that time?


Epaph.
The conclusion of that councell, as it is taken vp by learned Iunius, will give you greater satisfaction then all that I can say: Wherefore (sayth hee) the Apostle gaue good advice to the Kirke of God, that all the godly should abstaine from violating the first table of the Law, which is signified by Idolatry, and the pollution of Idols: from violating the second table of the Law,

which is contained under the name of fornication; And from violating the conscience of their brethren in things indifferent, which is declared by the name things strangled, and bloud; whereby yee may see that the generall vvas a morall dutie, and that the Gentiles at this time were tied to no practise. Neither at any time did the Apostles impose any ceremony upon any person or fellowship, that esteemed them unlawfull: neither would they grant libertie to the Gentiles to use the ceremonies, vvhich among the Iewes were indifferent.


Archip.
Might the Iewes who had the ceremonies at that time for indifferent, use them at their pleasure?


Epaph.
Nec simulate sed religiose non enim deserend^ c^ntinu^ vel ^ninucorum o^^^ectationibus tanquam canum mo^sibus pro^cienda Augustin.No creature may use th^ ^^st thing at his pleasure. The Iewes behoved to retaine them for a vvhile, as things both in nature and use indifferent, That is, (...) with assurance of their indifferencie, or without opinion of necessitie, 2. vvithout s^ancall, that the corps might be buried with honour. The Apostolick practises vvhich vvere at Ierusalem, not at Antio^h, amongst the I^wes, not amongst the Gentiles, were but so many steps to their graue. And the Apostolick prea^^^ng both at Antioch and Ierusalem, were the dead sound of the silver trumpet of the vvord, and open proclamations that they vvere c^parted, that their lif^ Iesus vvas no more in them, but in heaven, and that therefore they were to be buried.


Archip.
The Apostle sayth at some times, that they are nothing, and sometimes, that Circumcision abolisheth the vertue of Christ^ death.


Epaph
In respect of their indifferencie he saith, that circumcision is nothing, and the^fore skin is nothing but the keeping of the commandements of God; and therefore he circumcised Timothy, and Iudaiz^d among the Iewes, that he might win the Iewes. Againe, in respect of their necessitie and superstitious observation, as though they (...) the same force now. vvhich they had before, he saith, that if th^y were circumcised, Christ could profit them nothing.


Archip.
Their estate after their buriall. A^ pr^inde qui, quis nunc ch^^t^anorum quam v^ sit ex Iudais similitur ce^elrare vo^ui^it tanquam sepultos c^neres eruens non erit pius deductor vel ba^ulus corpo^is sed imp^us spultura violator. Aug. Ceremonias Iud^orum and per^^^osa sunt e^ mort^f^^^ christianis and quicunque cas observaverit sive ex Iudaeis sive ex Gentibus tum in ^^^^^rum diaboli devolutum. Idem.I come now to enquire of their estate after their buriall.


Epaph.
Their estate in that time is a meere nullitie: Their naked observation, which before was indifferent, become unlawfull: And whosoever he be that keepeth them now, albeit he were a l^w, denieth Christ. After their funerall they haue no more being

then before their birth. Mans institution of them then, and his observation of them now, are equally unlawfull. And as circumcision had been unlawfull to the Gentiles before in the time of the Interim, Gal. 5 2, so would it now haue been to the Iewes.


Archip.
Was it not after their buriall that the Apostle practised, Act. 16 and 21?


Epaph.
Some graue Divines (whom for Honours sake I will not name) that they may leaue a back dore open for festivall daies observed in the Kirk wherein they liue, vvill haue the ceremonies to be buried at the time of the Councell, Act. 15, and force themselues to interpret their buriall in respect of the opinion of necessitie, and not of observation. As though the observation of them without that opinion were yet lawfull, and were not Iudaicall, which were rather to beare downe the opinion of men, then to bury the bodie of Moses; to giue him the buriall of an Asse, and to mistake the decree or sentence concerning the buriall it selfe. All vvhich absurdities must follow the distinction of daies, even in the naked necessity of observation vvithout the conceit of superstition: seeing the Institution of new daies, or imitation of the daies of the Gentiles can be no better then the continuation, imitation or translation of the daies of the Iewes.


Archip.
I haue learned of all that ye haue said of this second determination; that the practise of the Iewish ceremonies in the first time, before the institution had been unlawfull; that in the second time after their institution it vvas acceptable worship: that the opinion of necessity vvhich vvas good in the second time, was in the third time unlawfull: and that their observation vvhich vvas indifferent, and being vvel used vvas good in the third time, is unlawfull in the fourth time. It vvas a sin first to obserue them at all; next to obserue them as indifferent; thirdly, as necessary; and fourthly at all. But I haue not learned to make the comparison right betwixt them and our ceremonies.


Epaph.
The controverted and Iewish ceremonies haue some things like, and some things unlike, as may thus appeare.The Iewish and controverted ceremonies parelled.

The one tolerated among the Iewes who had them before to win the obstinate and keep the weake.


The other commanded to Christians, who had them not before, to abdure the obstinate, and tyne the weake.


The one comming from heaven worthy of an honourable buriall.


The other comming from hell worthy of the buriall of the uncircumcised.

In the fourth time.

The one being buried are deadly to the converted Iewes to whom they were first necessary and after indifferent.


The other being abolished are obtruded upon Reformed Kirkes, who once bad them for Idolatrous, never for indifferent.



Archip.
If ye vvould compare the Iewish ceremonies vvith things indifferent in the Christian Kirk, I vvould trouble you no further in this point.
Epaph. As they be unlike to the controverted ceremonies both in nature and use: so are they unlike to all Ecclesiasticall Constitutions concerning things indifferent in nature albeit not in use.Iewish ceremonies and things indifferent in the Christian Kirk compared. The Apostolick rules are perpetuall for the use of all things indifferent in all the following times of the Kirk. But never was there, nor shall there be heereafter any time of the Kirk wherein there can be found things indifferent of that nature. For 1 they vvere once of divine authority, and behoved to be kept a vvhile; After that they entred into their indifferencie, that the Sinagogue might be solemnly buried: 2 After that observation there was a necessity of their exautoration, albeit the rules had been followed most strictly. Neither of the two can be said of things indifferent in the Christian Kirk. All which if M. Sprint had more unpartially considered, he had written a book rather of the necessity of Deprivation in case of Conformity. And not onely he but all others, except such as take the Pope for the Apostle his successor, would change their Apostolick and Apostaticall paralells in missallels, their cunning composition into hote opposition. One thing is necessary, but vvorldly necessity breeds manifold necessity, necessity of heresie, necessity of profanity, necessity of iniquity, necessity of Episcopacy, necessity of apostacy, necessity of Conformity

but onely in the case of Deprivation.


Archip.
You haue given me greater light in this ceremoniall controversie by that which ye haue said of that first and second determination, I thanke God for it, then ever I had before; and haue put me in good hope that ye will yet breake up a greater light for my full information when yee enter upon your third determination.


Epaph.
That Sunne of righteousnesse shine upon my dark mind that ye may haue some of my borrowed light, and both may be led to life in him who dwelleth in light. What it shall please his exceeding goodnesse to communicate I shall not hide under a bushell.Third determination Evangelical The third and last determination is Evangelicall and Christian.


Archip.
What difference make ye betwixt this and the former?


Epaph.
It is like the first, and unlike the second in immutability,(...). for Christ hath spoken in the last times, Heb. 1.1. Like the second and unlike the first in institution: for the last determination under the Gospell is not naturall but positiue. As the Lord made a positiue Ordinance for Circumcision so also for Baptism: And as a lamb was ordained for the Passeover, so bread and wine for the Communion. As it vvas made knowne by the first law vvhat vvas morally good and evill; by the second vvhat was ceremonially good or evill: so by this third determination it may be knowne distinctly and particularly vvhat is good or evill in the Christian Kirk to the end of the vvorld. With this difference that the law Moral stands constant as a certain and unalterable rule both in time of the ceremonies, and in time of the Gospell. But as it vvas unlawfull to use Evangelicall ceremonies in the time of the Law because the Lord had not as yet institute them so is it unlawfull to use Iudaicall ceremonies in the time of the Gospell because divine authority hath abolished them. Both stand with the law morall, but are incompatible betwixt themselues: both also are incompatible with the ceremonies of pagans and idolaters, and vvith all humane inventions.


Archip.
Seeing the Ceremonies of the Iewes are antiquat, is it not lawfull for the Christian Kirk to appoint new ceremonies in their place?


Epaph.
D. Downam hath been in a great slumber vvhen he wrot pag. 69 of Christian liberty: That as it is lawfull for Lawgivers to make civill Lawes in stead of the abolished judicial Law, that it is also lawfull for the Kirk, in her Provincionall, Nationall or Generall Synode to establish lawes Ecclesiasticall, in place of the abrogated law of Ceremonies: for vvhat vvere that else but to erect a new Ceremoniall law in place of the old, and to make

it necessary albeit not by necessity of divine precept,Si non necessitar^ medii aut precepti divini at saltem necessitate praecepti humans in Christiana subversienem libertatis and divini and humani juris aquipondium. as the former was during that time, yet to the wreck of Christian liberty by the necessity of mans commandement. Onely he that maketh summer to succeed after winter, the night to day, old age after youth, may set down one forme of worship after another. The saying of Vindicanus the witty Physition: The medicine workes not because I directed it not. Quia ego non jussi, belongeth to the Lord in matters of his worship, August epict. 5.


Archip.
He seemes to haue gone too farre, and I thinke in the Reformed Kirkes will find few followers. Yet I am sure the Lord vvho hath appointed Kirk Assemblies hath granted them some power, and vvherin can the power be, except it be in matters of Ceremonie?


Epaph.
That I deny not:Three sorts of ordinances in the Christian Kirk compared with the three sorts of Iewish ceremonies.
1 Divino divinae.2 Divino humanae.3 Humanae.
1 Divinae instieutiones. 2 Ecclesiastica constitutiones. 3 Humana inventiones. yet many are mistaken in taking up that power. And so was I for a long time, till I began in simplicity of heart to make the right comparison, betwixt the Christian and Iudaicall Kirk, the morall law keeping equall force in both.


Archip.
I would gladly heare of that comparison, that I may be as ye are, who am as ye vvas.


Epaph.
As in the Kirk of the Iewes there were three sorts of Ordinances, some merely Divine, some mixed, and some meerly humane: so haue there been answerably the same three kindes in the Christian Kirk; Divine Institutions, Ecclesiastick Constitutions, and humane inventions, (for so may they be named for distinction sake.) The Christian Kirk hath divine institutions as the Kirk of the Iewes had: the Kirk of the Iewes behoved to haue Ecclesiastick constitutions as the Christian Kirk hath. And both the kirk of the Iewes and the Christian Kirk, through Satans subtill tentation, and mans presuming superstition, haue been polluted with traditions of men and will-worship. Now when men will haue Ecclesiastick constitutions in the Christian Kirk, whether they be alone or joyned vvith divine to succeed lineally to divine institutions in the Iewish Kirk, and when men vvill haue their own traditions or inventions in the Christian Kirk, to answer Ecclesiastick or Divine constitutions in the Iewish Kirk: they goe awry, either not knowing vvhat Christian liberty is, or else wittingly turning it into licentiousnesse. They abridge Gods mar^hes,(...). Iud. 19. Divine institutions in the one and the other Kirk compared. and inlarge their owne.


Archip.
What comparison make ye then betwixt Divine Institutions in the one Kirk and the other?


Epaph.
Divine institution of Legall and Evangelicall worship is equally full and co^pleat in all things necessary, and that could conveniently be determined according to the co^mendation of good lawes, which leaue as little undetermined and without the compasse of the

Law as may be Giving of lawes is no part of Christian liberty under the Gospell more then under the Law. The King of the Kirk is her onely Lawgiver at all time.

Equally full and compleat, that cannot be: for divine institutions under the law were many in respect of the few institutions under the Gospell.


Epaph.
Yee vvill say vvith me it must be, if yee consider that in the ceremoniall law of Moses there vvere two things to be distinguished, number and light, multitude and direction; the one vvas a burthen, the other a benefite; the one a yoke, the other an ease. Evangelicall liberty makes the Christian Kirk free of the number and multitude: but the perfection of the Law-giver aboue Moses suffereth him not to giue lesse perfect and particular direction. We haue not multitudes of Sacrifices and Sacraments as the Iewes had. But our information concerning our few and easie Sacraments in every thing necessary and lawfull is as plaine and perfect, and fewer questions referred to the Kirkes decision now then at that time. As then negatiue conclusions from the Ceremoniall law vvere good, and affirmatiue bad; so are they now from the Gospell. They concluded thus, it is not commanded therefore it is not lawfull: and not thus; it is not forbidden, therfore it is lawfull; and so must vve now. Affirmatiue conclusions of that sort are indirect accusations of the vvord of God, and direct challenges of the personall ignorance of men, vvho for the most part can as little giue a sufficient reason from Scripture against Arrian heresie,Theologia in subjecto non adaequat Theologiam in objecto. Rectum est sui and obliqui norma. Nihil extra, praeter aut co^tra ^cripturam, nihil nisi ex scriptura doceri debet aut potest. Nisi quis sorte naturam in suo genere perfectam. Scripturam vero minus perfectam statuat ac proinde magis in natura Deum quum in Scriptura sap nisse Iun. Thes. disp. 6 thes. 9. as against kneeling at the Communion. Our knowledge ought to be fundamentally positiue, and occasionally privatiue It is vvell if vve can giue a reason for our owne practise from the Word, albeit vve cannot bring a place of Scripture against each errour that breaketh out of every crazie brain. It is a safer conclusion in health to say this agreeable to my constitution therefore I vvill use it: then, I knovv no harme this can doe, therefore I vvill use it. The Author to the Hebrewes reasoneth many times negatiuely in that Epistle: The Ancients use it frequently against the errour of their times: The Papists use it unwittingly; and all our Writers against the Papists use it purposely: And yet it is refused in this cause by our Adversaries to us.


Archip.
No marvell, for it hath place onely in matters dogmaticall and of faith, not in matters Traditionall and of Ceremony.



Epaph.
The vvord also must be the soule that giveth life to the ceremonies vvithout vvhich they are but dead carkasses.Verbum Del tanquam anima est quae ceremonias vivificat sublato verbo quicquid rituum observant homines etiamsi externa specie pi^rum observationi conveniat nihil aliud est quam putida and satua superstitio. Nonne vides ista qu^a in Sacrosancto hoc pharmacopolio non continentu^ proinde nullius esse pretii. D. Morio. But lest ye be miscarryed any longer in this point: I aske first if the Romane Kirk vvould enjoyne Chrisme, extreme unction, holy Water (vvhich D. Morton alledgeth for examples against the Papists) onely as Traditionall, or in their nature indifferent, and not as things necessary to salvation, vvhether vvould his vvords make against her. See ye not, because these things are not contained in holy Scripture therefore to be of no vvorth; for the observation of such ceremonies are not in Scripture more then the superstition of them. I aske next, whether the Crosse in Baptisme, Surplice, Holy-daies, kneeling at the Communion etc. may not bee ranked vvith Chrisme, holy water, etc. that opinion of necessity being removed. Thirdly, I aske vvhether a simple affirmation that the ceremonies questioned are indifferent vvith a subtill and vehement urging of them more then of matters of greatest necessity vvithout any demonstration of their indifferencie, be either sufficient proofes that they are intended for things indifferent by the Vrgers, or sufficient information to Pastors and people to judge of them as of things indifferent. Doe not the Lutherans after this manner remoue sacramentall fraction, defend their images, Auricular Confession. And vvhat ceremony is there in all Paganisme, Iudaisme; vvhat amongst the Papists or Lutherans: vvhat of the vvhole Altar of Damascus that may not be brought in under the vale of Indifferency. If it be sufficient to say that it is not urged as necessary to salvatio^: He that enforceth the^ as necessarie, and affirmeth they are indifferent; and he that practiseth vvith the^ and preacheth against them, is like him Prou. 26. As a man who casteth fire-brands, arrowes and death, so is the man that deceiveth his neighbour and saith, Am not I in sport. Practise, command, compulsion are better copies of the mind, then profession in men who pretend they doe nothing against conscience. And people vvho are more moved vvith vvhat they see then vvhat they heare,Quid verb^ audiam cum facta videam. Vos nunime fugiunt conc^atus quibus angebatur conscientiae mea propter illam quam sequebar vitae vationem innumeris quotidie superstitionibus connivendum erat. Superstitios^ritus non solum mihi peragendi: virumetiam ab aliis imp^rtu^^ exigendi multa faciebam aliter quam sentiebam and docebam, p. 1073. may say vvhat doe vve heare vvords vvhile wee see deeds. Were there hearts as free of the vvorld as P. Martyrs vvas, they vvould perhaps deplore their case vvith him; and confesse the vexation of their conscience in practising and urging rites of that sort as he did.


Archip.
I see now that albeit the multitude of precepts be not so great, yet the divine direction is as plaine and perfect under the



Gospell as ever it was before. Come to the second part of the comparison betwixt Ecclesiastick constitutions under the Law and under the Gospell, vvherin I foresee the greatest difficulties.


Epaph.
Second sort compared.Heere indeed properly commeth in the consideration of things indifferent by Ecclesiasticall authority determinable: a subject in Divinity most like that of time, place, motion in naturall Philosophy. If yee aske not vvhat they are every man knoweth: But if aske vvhat they are, no man can tell you. A subject disputed mightily, but determined weakly; as most neerely touching the outward face of every Kirk in the eyes of the world, and the crownes and bellies of Kirkmen in their own feeling. And hence on all sides so full of prejudice and heat of contention that it hath almost ruined the Kingdome of Christ, set up the kingdome of Antichrist, divided Pastors, offended people, dismembred the Kirk, and onely not put out the very life of true piety. Oh that it would please the Lord at last to pitie the Kirke redeemed with his bloud, and that vine vvhich his right hand hath planted. O Lord our God who hast in former times gotten renowme to thy name amongst us; and seest how this day we are become a reproach to all that are about us, cause yet thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate for the Lords sake. O Lord heare, O Lord forgiue, O Lord hearken and doe, deferre not for thy owne sake o our God, for thy people are called by thy name. Open our eyes o father of Lights, for if we be so blind in things lying before our feet, what know we in the high mysteries of the Gospell: if we swimme in these shallow foords of practise, how shall we wade the bottomlesse seas of thy vvisedome. Giue us the simplicitie of the Lamb, banish from us procacitie and disdainfull sharpnesse of vvit: subdue our distempered affections that vve presume not to frame rules for thy worship; cut them off vvho seek to please themselues by displeasing thee, vvho build up their worldly estates upon the ruines of thy Kirk. Saue us all from perfidiousnesse against thee, and that deere mother Kirk in vvhose bowels we haue our first and second birth, and in vvhose skirts we are nursed to this day. Behold hee commeth in the clouds, and every eye shall see him, and they also who pearced him, and all kinreds of the earth shall waile because of him: even so, Amen.

Thrice happy were that man vvhom the Lord would honour to be an instrument of Pacification by manifesting the truth to every mans conscience in this so long-lasting controversie. I see that the most part agree in the generall, both about the nature and about the use of things indifferent: As enuntiations of things contingent are necessary and not contingent. So the

generall A^iomes of things indifferent and variable are not indifferent but invariable in all ages and nations.Sicut singularium and co^tingentiu^ ita and indifferentium d^tarenta scientia in actu signato. The true doctrine of indifferencie is the same in Scotland, England, Germany etc. The same in the times of the old and new Testament. The Apostolick rules of respect to Gods glory, to order and decency, to scandall and edification, are no new precepts, but the exposition of the law Morall, requiring loue to God and our neighbour: and transgressed as well by the Pharisees of old, as by their successors since. Wherein then standeth the greatest diversity and difficulty?


Epaph.
Ye will finde it to be in the Application of these generall rules to the particulars controverted in diverse Kirkes. The Roman Kirk hath an unwritten Word for all that, they vvill haue embraced beside, that vvhich they finde in Scripture. The Lutherane Kirks hold somethings for indifferent vvhich the Kirk of England findeth to be condemned in the Word; and England defends a multitude of Ordinances about Discipline and ceremonies for indifferent, vvhich vve take to be unlawfull, and besides the warrant of the Word: the matter going vvith severall Kirks, every one judging according to her own measure of Reformation, as vvith severall Christians every one judging according to his owne degree of grace and regeneration. And vvhat vvonder if all the reformed Kirkes creeped not forth of that Romane deluge equally accomplished; vvhat greater vvonder then that any should be found free of the smell of that wine of fornication, whereof they all for so many yeares were drunke.


Archip.
For making the right application; of necessity two points must be insisted upon 1 How and by vvhat notes I shall know such accidentall, circumstantiall and individuall ceremonies as are the proper object of mans determination. And thus vvhat particulars are left to be in nature indifferent. 2 After what sort must the determination of man passe upon them, that the actions about things indifferent may be good; and so of their use. For the first Lambertus Danaeus giveth some lightDistinguendum est de disciplin^ partibus, quaedam esse in ea essen^ alia omnino, quadam accidentalia. Essentialia sunt omnia quae de Electione and manere personarum Ecclesiasticarum hic traduntur. Accident^^^ sunt quae ad particularem earum rerum modum servandum, sormamone aliquam constitu^^dum and cujusque populi commoditatis ration in habendam pertinent, veluis quotie^ Episcopo s^ la Heodomad^ conclon^ndum, quiebus diebus, qua hor^, quo loco, and catera quae sunt hi^ usmodi Danaus in 1 Tim. 3 15. while he distinguisheth betwixt things essentiall and things accidentall in the discipline of the Kirk. All things are essentiall that are set down there concerning the office and election of Ecclesiastick persons. Things accidentall are such as concerne the particular manner and forme of doing of things essentiall, as may serue best for the commodity

of every people: as how oft the Bishop of the place shall preach every week, upon vvhat daies, what houre, in vvhat place, etc. And Iunius to the same sense.Quaecunque in circumstantiis posita sunt corum traditiones in Ecclesia esse aut no^ esse posse, veruntamen te^porales, particulares and liberas agnoscimus; quaedam non nisi a praesente monstrantur (ait Seneca) non potest medicus per Epistolas cibi aut ba^nei tempus eligere, vena, tangenda est, vetus proverbium est gladiatorem in arena capere consilium, Iun. disp. 6 Thes. 11 12. Traditions of things consisting in circumstances may be and may not be in the Kirk; yet we acknowledge them (saith he) to be temporary, particular and free. He citeth Seneca to this effect saying. Some things are not known but by him that is present. The Physitian cannot chuse the time of meat or medicine for his patient by letter, the veine must be touched. And the fencer must advise vvhen he is now entred vvithin the listes. I thinke both say well to the purpose. What thinke yee?


Epaph.
Ye haue both taken up the points very right, and haue observed good grounds for the first. It cannot be denyed but there is a mutability, and oftentimes a necessity of mutation in Ecclesiastick Canons as well as in Civill Lawes, and that upon two grounds; one is the condition of the persons that make the constitutions vvho may become wiser and profite in knowledge in such measure that they be brought to the sight of their former errours or inexpediency of preceding constitutions. In this caseFoelix est necessitas quae in meliora co^pellit. it is a happy necessity that compelleth men to doe better. The other ground is the nature of the subject vvhereupon, and the constitution of the persons for vvhom the Canons are made, vvith other circumstances variable.Nam alia lux infanti sertur, alia viro, alia aratori serenti, alia metenti alia c^dibi, alia conjugato. Inn. de Posit. Mosis c. 4. And therefore the Apostle saith vvell of one sort of Lawes, saith the Lord. But of this sort, I say, not the Lord.(...), Coloss. 1 9. Quisquis les immutabiles ratione and modo immutabili adminiserandus and procuiandas putat, is domi prudentiam parentum in regendis liberis, ruri peritiam ^taterum in col^ndi^ agris, in alto peritiam nautarium in observandis ventis damnaturus est: et lum constantem perpetuamque rationem serv^e putat, ves ipsas quibus ratio consulit contra rationem perditu^^s. Inn. cod. cap. As there is a generall wisedome considering vvhat is lawfull, so there is a particular prudence judging according to the occurrences vvhat is expedient. Without these two cases, when either the matter is not variable; or the matter being variable, the change is not to the better, it is both without and against reason to change: vvithout reason because vvhen the change is made into that vvhich is as good, the one and the other in reason is equall: against reasonIpsa mutatio cons^^indius, etiam quae millitare surv^^, (...) per^^^^. because the very change hindereth the common edification, bringeth the discredite of innovation,

and extenuate the authority of the Law. This poore Kirk hath the dolefull proofe of the latter. All the question is of the former; vvhether the things changed be in their nature variable, Your observation giveth some light: but the light vvill be greater both in our controverted particulars, and in the matter of indifferency in generall: if out of the humble consideration of the intention of Gods spirit in committing his vvill to writ, and of his perfect wisedome for fulfilling that intention compared with the course of the Scripture it selfe, and vvith the positions of all the Divines of the Reformed Kirks vvhose eyes haue not been blinded either vvith prejudice or loue of the vvorld, we could resolue upon two grounds.


Archip.
I pray you, vvhich are these?


Epaph.
One is, vvhatsoever was of that condition,First ground for knowing what is by nature indifferent. vvhether under the law or the Gospell that it could not possibly or conveniently be determined by a generall and positiue law, as it behoved to be, so vvas it left to the determination of the true Kirk following the direction of the generall rules. And hence the cause is evident vvhy the divine determination under the Gospell in the Oecumenick Kirk could not be so particular as in the Nationall Kirk of the Iewes. But neither in the one not in the other vvas there any thing left to the Kirk vvhereupon particular determination conveniently could passe before. Vnder the Law the daily sacrifice, and more particularly the morning and evening sacrifice vvere appointed; but the houre vvas left to the Kirk, because it vvas hard vvithout scruple of conscience to be tyed to that, and the precise observation thereof had been almost impossible. Vnder the Gospell the Lords day is sanctified, but the particular houre of the day for publick worship in divers Nations and seasons of the yeare could not be designed: and therefore permitted to the discretion of nationall kirks, and Particular Congregations, observing the generall rules. Vnder the Law the word behoved to be preached publickly in their Cities upon the Saboths, vvhen they came not up to Ierusalem, but no particular determination of the places and Synagogues: even so under the Gospell a publick place for publick vvorship necessary, but no particular situation nor appointing of Congregations. In Iudaea, a nomination of the tribe of Levi for the Ministery, the like vvhereof could not be under the Gospell throughout the whole world, far lesse whither Iohn or Iames. Publick preaching and prayer commanded, but the individuall points of doctrine, petitions of prayer, and some other particular circumstances concerning the order and manner of worship, impossible to determine, because they must varie according to the occasion and cases

of persons, places, purposes etc.


Archip
That seemeth to me both a sure and plain ground, my soule blesseth you for it, come on with the second.


Epaph.
The other is; vvhatsoever vvas unprofitable or needed not to be determined particularly by divine authority,The second ground. as being most easily discernable by the light of nature, that is not particularly determined by the vvord, but left to the determination of the Kirk, keeping still the direction of the generall rules. And hence it is manifest that the determination of the Scripture could not possible be more particular vvithout superfluity. This is the perfection of that wisedom* that it hath neither defect nor excesse; that it neither wanteth any thing possible, nor hath any thing unprofitable. It is commanded that the Pastor shall preach to the people, but whether he shall stand on his head or his feet, with his face or his back turned toward them, in a high or a low pulpit, it is left to the light of nature: That Baptisme be ministred with water, but as the vvater of Iudaea had been impossible, so it vvas unprofitable to determine with vvhat vvater: That the Lords Supper be celebrate in bread and wine, but as the bread and vvine of Iudaea vvas impossible, so the light of nature directs whence vve shall haue them. The determination of the time and houre vvas not possible, and may be known by naturall reason but the gesture is determined, and albeit it had not been expressed, it followeth upon the table.


Archip.
I take it up: And it vvould seeme that your two grounds joyn together in this; that what was most hardly determinable in the generall by divine authority, was most easily discernable by natures light: And againe, what in the particular was most cognoscible by naturall knowledge, vvas most difficult to generall determination.


Epaph.
A threefold consequent out of the two former grounds.So it is, and ye shall see that being well considered they furnish us vvith this threefold consequent for our direction. First, nothing meerely positiue, voluntary, or that floweth from free institution vvithout any help of the light of nature, can bee by nature indifferent in the vvorship of God, or can be the matter of Ecclesiastick constitution; vvhether it come by humane invention, imitation of the enemy, or translation of Gods ordinances, because whatsoever is necessary of that sort, is not onely possible, but easie to divine and generall determination.


Archip.
How serveth that first consequent for our direction?


Epaph.
Because hence it followeth, that wine, sale, spittle, crosse in Baptisme, surplice, kneeling in the time of receiving, festivall daies etc. are to be rejected. For albeit kneeling in some other exercises of Religion may be naturall, yet in communicating, it is

meerely voluntary. Even as diverse religious washings under the Law were of divine institution. Heb. 9 10. Yet the other religious washings remembred Math. 15.1, and Mark. 7 4, were onely of mans invention and institution, because wrong applyed, Math. 1^ 3, Mark. 7 7. That vvhich is necessary by the light of nature, or by divine institution in one part of divine worship, may be positiue and vvil-worship in another. Observation of daies is of the same kind. The determination of an anniversary day is no lesse positiue, and as easily determinable by a generall law as the observation of the weekly Saboth.


Archip.
Which is your second consequent?


Epaph.
The second is, whatsoever is left to Ecclesiastick determination after that it is determined hath a reason from the light of nature, wherefore it vvas so determined and not otherwise, having in it a certaine expediencie or a kind of necessity sensible to every one endued with naturall reason: As wherefore one houre or place rather then another is chosen for divine exercise; vvhy one person rather then another is to be a Minister; why fasting at one time and not at another; why such doctrines and petitions at one season more then another. Now the light of nature vvill never teach any to kneele in the time of eating and drinking at the Lords Table, but rather to use a Table-gesture. Nor can the light of nature giue a reason why the 25 of December should be observed, except it be pretended to be the birth day, which is evidently false, or because it is a fit time for feasting, which is both profane and sensuall.


Archip.
Which is the third consequent?


Epaph.
The third is; the variable matter of Ecclesiasticall determination can never be vniversall, nor concluded upon internall or generall reasons, but locall, temporall, personall, circumstantiall; otherwaies it could not be changeable, neither could it haue been left for men to determine. And therfore kneeling vvith the reason vvhereupon it is concluded, cannot bee a matter indifferent, but necessary to bee practised by all communicants in all times and places. And observation of dayes is of the same sort: for were it a thing indifferent, then one kirk vvould make choyce of one time for instructing of the people in the naitivitie, and another kirk another time.Vniformitat in majoribus caeremon^s necessaria: in minoribus impossibilis. Either that observation must be necessarie or unlawfull. Everie indifferent thing is variable; and upon occasions may and must be changed: and therefore all conformitie in greater ceremonies is necessarie, because they are specified in the word, so conformitie in lesse ceremonies is vnpossible, because they depend upon circumstances variable, as conformitie in language and naturall disposition.



Archip.
O vvhat a happines vvere it, if men could keep themselues vvithin their marches; and not sacrilegiously usurpe the Lords propertie. If they would make onely such matters the matter of their Ecclesiastick Canons, as the Lord had not passed any determination upon before. And by that vvhich yee haue taught me, if the vvill of men did not stand in their light, it were easie to see what things were in nature indifferent.


Epaph.
It were indeed the beginning of a happines; but it might end in a miserie, if the rules concerning the use of things in nature indifferent were not observed,Rules for the use of things indifferent. as vvell as their nature rightly taken up. And it feareth me, when ye haue thought upon these rules, ye shall find that we are more mistaken in the use then in the nature.


Archip.
Some men are so licentious, that they thinke they may make their owne pleasure the rule for their use of a thing indifferent. Others are so peremptorie, that they affirme there is nothing in use indifferent. I know not what to think.


Epaph.
Distinguendum inter fidem et factu^, inter (...) and (...), inter actum nudum and circumstantion^um, Inter actum in specie and individuo, inter rem consideratam in actu signato and actu exercite.That indifferencie hath place onely in the generall, or in the nature of the action, and not in the particular or in the use, it almost vniversally confessed, vvhile men distinguish with the Apostle betwixt our faith and our fact; vvith others betwixt our profession and our use, betwixt the naked action, and the action clothed vvith circumstances; betwixt one action generall and Individuall. Indifferencie of action can no more be found in the second sense, then it can be denied in the first. All the actions of man in his integritie vvere good; all the actions of man in glory shall be good; all the actions of man under sinne, let the matter be most indifferent in nature, are evill; and all the actions of man under grace are either good or evill, not one of them all indifferent. Were all our actions ruled by the word, as they ought to be, all our actions would be good as they ought to be. For howsoever the word be not, as it ought not to be, an Encyclopedia or generall summe of all Arts and Sciences, an vniversal directorie for all our actions, as they are naturall, civill, moral, oeconomiall, yet the particular determination of all our actions falleth under the rules of the word, in so farre as they be Christian and spirituall, according to the nature of all professions and Sciences coincident for the most part in the matter, but distinct in their manner of consideration. The lifting up of a straw (the Schoolmens example) may be an evill action, and must be either good or evill, especially proceeding of deliberation. Rules of health and good manners forbid it in some cases, and so doe rulers of divinitie. There is no truth more unsavourie to the Libertine, a greater paradox to the ignorant, and of greater mocking to the worldling, and yet never denied

by any Philosopher or divine, except some few vvho make a distinction betwixt actions proceeding of meere imagination, and actions proceeding of deliberation, in the one placing indifferencie and not in the other. The Idlenesse of which distinction might be easily shewne; but that it were not to our purpose, vvhich runneth upon matters controverted, concluded, resisted, and so proceeding of deliberation, and not from imagination. Hee that esteemeth it a matter indifferent for him to kneel or sit at the communion, to observe or not to observe a festivall day, now after it is called in question, hath neither reason nor authoritie of any vvriter for him: and therfore carrieth a note of singularie.


Archip.
When I haue heard you, I cannot deny the truth, yet I am not perswaded. For first I may say, that it is Theologia in abstructo, and not in concreto. I know no man, but every day doth many things indifferently. 2. That ground will breed innumerable scruples of conscience, and is the ready vvay to beget superstition. 3. I know not vvhat things are requisite for making an action by nature indifferent, to be good, that all our actions may be good, as yee say they ought to be.


Epaph.
Yet all the Divines lay it for a ground, and I would haue wished that yee had suppressed your first doubt. In many things we sinne all; idle vvords, idle gestures, lookes, etc. are scored up in the accompts of men. For the second, beware of profanity in declining of superstition. But in the second and third both, yee shall say, that ye are satisfied if yee consider, that as in naturall and artificiall bodies, produced according to the course of nature, and skill of Art, there is a concurrencie of the worker,^onum est ex imegra ca^sa, (...) vero ex singulis desec^^us. of the matter, of the forme and of the end; for their full accomplishment and perfection before God and man say that they are good. Even so in some correspondence their must concurre the vvhole foure causes for accomplishing of every action morall or spirituall, that it may be acceptable to God. It is for the first necessary that the person or persons, efficient be In Christ by faith, vvithout which it is imposible to please God:Four causes concurring to make a good action. that the action be with the renewing spirit of God, and of the working spirit of God. 2 the matter or substance of the action be indeed either good or indifferent in respect of the object, and that it be throughly known to be such. If it be not either good or indifferent, the action is done with an erronious conscience. If it be not knowne to be such, it is done either vvith a doubting,V^l errante, vel dubitante, vel haesitante, vel repugna^^^e conscienti^: conscientia (...) non min^^ a licitis quam ab illicitis ^o^ibet dubil^^t^^, haesti^^tem, repug^^^te^, vel tandeus audente conscientia. or unresolved or contradicting conscience. If there be a defect of both, the action is done with a

bold conscience; the first is great, the second greater, the third the greatest sinne.


Archip.
Nothing of all that can be denyed: what say ye of the third and fourth cause, the manner of doing and the end?


Epaph.
The forme or manner of doing presupposeth the matter, either to be good in respect of the object, or to be indifferent, and requireth a conformitie with the law of God in the circumstances.Circumstantiae interdum constituunt actionem in specia morit, alias reddunt actionem meliorem, and malam priorem. For a good action may haue a twofold conformitie with the law, one is principall, and more substantiall in respect of the object, vvhich is commanded (we say may haue, because sometimes the obiect is indifferent.) The other consisteth in the circumstances, which sometimes make the action good or evill; sometimes onely make the good action better, or the evill worse: but haue greatest sway where the obiect is indifferent: for then the manner of doing, as order, decencie, sobrietie, doe in a manner specificate the action.


Archip.
Ye seeme to confound: for the circumstances containe all the foure causes, as vvho, vvhat, etc. which ye referre all to the formall cause, or manner of doing.


Epaph.
In the enumeration of circumstances, vve must not take Quis who for the efficient cause, but for his condition or qualitie, as a privat or publick person, a Pastor or a Professor, a king or a subiect: Nor quid vvhat for the matter or obiect, but the qualitie thereof:Mediate vel immediate actu vel virtute, ut reqiusitus reddere queas rationem a fine cur hoc feceris vel ^miseris. as, whether it be a matter of salvation, or of life, or of geare: Nor Quomodo, for this forme, but whether it bee done openly or secretly, simply or craftily, etc. all which aggrege tho same. The end is first either immediatly or mediatly, either actually or virtually the honor of God of all the ingredients of a good action, the most common in profession, the rarest in intention, and yet the worthiest and sweetest. And, next our own and our neighbours good, the principall is the edification both of our owne soules, and of the salvation of others, contrarie to the great evil of offence.


Archip.
Ye say then in summe, that a good man doth that which is good or indifferent, in the best manner, to a good end. All foure may be brought unto two, Bonum good, and Bene well. Because no man but a good man can doe an action well with due regard of the circumstances, and the end. If it be neither bonum good, nor bene well, it is neither with the Holy Ghost, nor of the Holy Ghost. If it be bonum good, and not bene well, as the good workes of naturall or civill men; it is of the Holy ghost, but not with the holy Ghost. If it be Bene well and not Bonum good, it is with the Holy Ghost, but not of the Holy Ghost. But if it be bonum good and bene well, it is both with and of the holy Ghost.



Epaph.
That is right, and the common saying,Bona opera non nominibus sed adverbij^ sunt indicanda, Pie, sobri^, iuste. that Good workes are to be judged by Adverbs, is true of all good actions: for all must bee done vvith the Apostles adverbiall conditions, Soberlie, Righteously, Godly. But it is especially true of good actions, vvhere the matter is indifferent, because they haue no goodnesse at all, but that vvhich is from the Adverbe. And therefore vve may call actions that haue Bonum good, and vvant Bene vvell (as the good actions of the Heathen, properly peccata per accidens, sinnes by accident: as being bona opera per se, good actions in themselues. The actions that haue for their matter a thing indifferent, and vvant Bene vvell, as the actions of Christians about things indifferent (for they cannot be called bona opera per se, good workes in themselues) and therefore the more improperly Peccata per accidens, sinnes by accident. Looking upon an action good in the matter, vve may say that it is good simply Necessitate consequentis, by necessitie of consequent; because all actions commanded of God are good. But looking upon the actions even of Christians in matters indifferent, vve can onely say that they are good necessitate consequentiae, by necessitie of consequence, supponing that whatsoever action hath the former conditions, is good: and that the actions vve judge of, haue the conditions.
Archip. Qui vise loing jamais ne rend son coup heureux. I vvould haue you to make some application of these foure causes to our own matters.


Epaph.
Seeing all our actions even the meanest,Applied to the purpose. require all the foure causes or conditions, much more our actions in the worship of God. And yet more, the actions which we must not doe once all our life, but as frequently as vve are partakers of such a vvorship. But most of all the actions and acts of a kirk assembled for direction in the matters of Gods vvorship. For if they faile either in the matter taking that for indifferent, vvhich is evill, or in the manner of their convening and proceeding without regard to the formalizing circumstances, or in the end respecting the pleasure of man more then the pleasing of God, and the profit of the kirk; in so far as they faile, they are sinfull. And according to the qualitie of the defect, take upon them the kind of sin under which they may be ranked. Let the consciences of professors try, whether the acts of Perth Assembly dare undergoe this examination: Whether it was a lawfull Synod in it selfe: Whether they cleared the indifferencie of their articles, before they concluded them, vvhether the circumstances may giue it a dash. Quis? vvho? the kirk of Scotland so vvorthily reformed. Quid? what? that which they had formerly sp^ed out; and had sworn and subscrived never to lick up againe. Vbi? vvhere? not in another Kirk or Nation, but even vvhere

they had sworne. Quibus auxilijs? by vvhat meanes, God and the world now knowes. Cur? vvherfore? for conforming to a glorious kirk, but in that vvherein she vvas never reformed. Quomodo? how? God and their owne hearts know. Quando? at vvhat time? vvhen Antichrist is prevailing, Papists presuming, and Idolatry re-entring. And finally, vvhether they had either the glorie of God, or the salvation of the people in their sight, vvhich indeed none during that Assembly vvere so shamelesse as to pretend. And let every one try himselfe, vvhether hee bee moved by the spirit of God to practise according to the constitutions thereof; vvhether he be throughly persuaded that the matter is indifferent: vvhether he keepeth all the requisite circumstances; and vvhether his practise bee free of offence. The superstitious conscience will please it selfe in the shew of humble vvill-worship. The sleeping and sencelesse conscience vvill judge all to be alike till the Lord giue a wakening vvith his terrors. The bold conscience, after it hath carried seven dayes, vvill venture the sacrifice vvith Saul, 2. Sam. 13.10. And the accusing conscience vvill take leaue vvith N^aman, and say, In this thing the Lord be mercifull unto mee, 2, King. 5.19.


Archip.
Civill and ecclesiastick power in things indifferent.Thinke yee that our superiours Civill and Ecclesiasticke, may not command in things indifferent at their pleasure?


Epaph.
None of themselues vvill thinke it. Albeit I had rather learne my owne lesson of obeying, then teach their lesson of commanding, I shall in humilitie tell you my minde of both: As no power under God can make that good vvhich he forbiddeth; nor make that evill vvhich he commandeth: not make that good or evill materially, vvhich hee hath left indifferent; So is there no power civill or Ecclesiasticke, that in a matter of it selfe most indifferent may command against pietie, decencie, sobrietie, or charitie.habet homo libertatem arbitrij ad su ^^ndum quod licet: libertatem consilij ad jubendum quod expedit: Deus solus ha^^^ ^^bertatem conp^aciti ad jubendum quod libet. Man hath libertie of vvill to command that vvhich is lawfull: libertie of counsell to command vvhat is expedient; but the Lord onely hath libertie of pleasure to command vvhat he vvill. @ Many things also are permitted to the Kirk, but nothing without limitation. It is a matter indifferent to eat of such a meat, yet no power can command to eat of it against Pietie, that is, except the grace be sayd, and it be sanctified by prayer. No power can enioyne the doing of an action indifferent against decencie, whether in place, time, or manner of doing. Against sobrietie to use our libertie as an occasion to the flesh,(...). or to passe the bounds of temperance, frugalitie, modestie. Against charitie; because when the matter about vvhich vvee are exercised, is indifferent, as in the manner of doing impietie, indecencie, intemperancie, so also

scandall is a sinne, and for the most part more incurable and perilous then the former: vvhether it bee (...) a stumbling blocke making the vveake to fall, or (...) an offence, grieving them, or making them to halt: the word calleth it murther. And so it is ratione medij, in respect of the meane, because it is apt to destroy: albeit ratione eventu^, in respect of the event, none shall perish for whom Christ died. Cursed is bee that layeth a stumbling block in the way of the blinde, and all the people shall say, Amen: Woe unto him that doth offend one of these little ones. etc.


Archip.
I grant yee cannot say ill enough of scandall; but must not I obey my superiors although all should be offended, the scandall (if there be any) is but taken: and I haue no purpose to give scandall to any, but onely to obey.


Epaph.
Albeit I speake against the practise of the vvorld,Three grounds concerning scandall. yet I shall not willingly decline from the received doctrine of the reformed Kirkes, and the better sort of the Scholastickes, in answering your obiection by three grounds. In the meane time yee might haue left your Parenthesis; Hee that denieth that there is any scandall, is like him who could not see the wood for the trees. The bleating of the sheepe,Statuta Ecclesiae per se non sunt de necessitate salutis, sed solu^ ex institutione Ecclesiae: and adeo non obligant si assue^t rationabile impedimentu^, 2 2 ae. q. 147 art. 4.Leges autem humana non obligant ex voluntate legislatoris, sed ex ipsa le^um vtilitate et ratione, D Fild. l. 4. c. 34.N^cessitate praescientia and indicij divini: necessitate efficientia, Saranica nempe malitiae and human^ corruptionis and necessitate s^^is: verumetia^ necessitate obiecti. i. infir^^^^ a scandalo sibi satis cavire nequuntinu^ and the lowing of the oxen are loud in Samuels eares. The vvalking of Diogenes is meetest for a Zeno, vvho against all reason denyeth that there is any motion. The first ground is, that Ecclesiastick and civill constitutions about things indifferent oblige not Extra casum scandali out of the case of Scandall, by reason that they are supponed to intend edification. Secondly, as everie scandall is sinne, Passiue in the patient, Actiue in the agent, and mixt in both; so scandall actiue or given, hath place not onely in things vnlawfull, but indifferent. Blessed is bee that condemneth not himselfe in that which hee alloweth. Rom. 14. And that which is mixt scandall commeth neerest to the nature of actiue; hardly or never can there bee a publick scandall taken, except it bee also actiue and given. Seeing there must bee offences, not onely by necessitie of Gods decree, of Satans malice, of mans corruption, of the end, that the Kirke may bee tried, but also by necessitie of the object, that is, of the infirme and weake, vvho cannot keepe themselues from stumbling, vvhen the rocke lieth in the way; all occasions of taking of offence ought to be removed and prevented. Otherwise Ezekias might haue suffered the brasen Serpent to stand, the scandall vvhereof was onely taken

But had he suffered, farre more had he ordained it by law to stand after the abuse, the scandall had been mixt, and more actiue then passiue. Thirdly, scandall is given not onely in intentione operantis, in the intention of the doer: but also negligente operante in conditione operis, the doer being negligent in the qualitie of the deed. Not onely that person giveth scandall amongst us, vvho by the ceremonies would reduce Poperie, or symbolize with the Papists, or knoweth them to be dangerous: but he also vvho not knowing or fearing danger, yeeldeth to practise them, and that propter conditionem operis, by reason of the qualitie of the deed. As the Nurse that putteth a knife into the hand of her childe, of meere negligence, yea albeit it vvere of loue; and he that suffereth a goating Oxe to goe abroad, farre more if hee let him loose. Our owne late act of Parliament (not unlike that ancient law of Millane remembred by Sigonius) for preventing of fire in the Towne of Edinburgh, is a strong confutation of the first act. It was unlawfull among the Iewes to bow before an Idoll for the knitting of the shooe latchet. His shift vvas but silly vvho vvould haue seemed to fall downe before the Persian King to take up his ring, vvhich he had purposely let fall, and not to doe the king honour, vvhich he vvould haue avoyded. Eleazar vvould neither eat swines flesh, nor seeme to eat it by eating common flesh. And Secundus vvould neither deliver the Bible, nor seeme to be one of the Traditors by delivering another thing to be burned. Amos, sayth Ribera, putteth the event for the cause, vvhen he sayth, cap. 2. They went in to a maid to defile mine holy name.


Archip.
All that ye haue sayd of Scandall, goeth vvell vvith the course of the vvord, and seemeth agreable to the doctrine of Christ denouncing vvoe upon them not only vvho giue, but also by who^ offences come. Agreeable to the doctrine of the Apostle, Rom. 14. after he had taught obedience to the Magistrate, chap. 13. His reason is morall, perpetuall, peremptorie, and vniversall without exception of contramanding authoritie. And therefore the conclusion must be of the same size. His meaning is not, Destroy not him for vvhom Christ died, except Caesar command. But not so agreeable to the doctrine of all our Divines, Beza himselfe is alledged to the contrarie, epist. 24. And ye know your selfe vvhat D. Downame sayth.


Epaph.
No man can be so brasen faced, as to cite that Epistle of Beza to the contrarie vvithout blushing, except it be Mr. Mitchelson our Doctor, vvho I remember in the first argument of his Plagiarie and poore pamphlet taken from the nature of things indifferent, bringeth the vvords going before, and following of that Epistle for his purpose, and perfidiously passeth these; Rerum modiarum

vsut nimium promiscuns coercetur, tum in genere, tum in specie: In genere per legem charitatis, etc. that is, the too common use of things indifferent is restrained both generally, and in particular, generally by the law of charitie, etc. While Beza giveth two rules for their vse and restraint, one first and generall of charitie, belonging to all men, and all matters of that sort, that nothing otherwise indifferent and lawfull be done vvhereby our brother is destroyed; or left undone, vvhereby he may be edified: he alledgeth onely the second of civill and Ecclesiastick determination, vvhich is lesse principall, and may impose nothing contrarie, not prejudiciall to the former, vvhich is the main and principal, grounded upon the originall law of nature.


Archip.
But what say ye to the other?


Epaph.
A wonder it is, vvhat Doct. Douname can meane in good earnest by marching loyalty in order after piety, and before sobriety and charity. If the Magistrate haue absolute and unbounded authority in things indifferent (which for fashion sake he denyeth in the generall) What can be the cause why, the matter being, indifferent he giveth not the first place to loyalty preferring it to piety? or if limited and restrained, why shall not sobriety and charity be the limits as well as piety? Albeit it bee lawfull to pledge the King his health; yet neither sobriety nor piety ought to be banished from the table. Neither can he say that drinking beyond the bounds of sobriety for once, carryeth a greater guiltinesse then to practise that many times vvhich may destroy a soule for whom Christ dyed. May there not be cases of Antinomy, or opposition of the lawes of loyaltie and pietie, of loyaltie and sobriety, as well as of loyaltie and charity. And as he alledgeth, that there is Scandalum (...) equall offence in the one; albeit he know that authority judging them to be indifferent may well be displeased but cannot be scandalized, at least in ae^uilibrio, in equality with the other scandall. May there not be (...) peccati, equalitie of sinne in the other, in times or places where there ruleth an ungodly or intemperate Magistrate. Bezaes order making charity the first and generall rule; and seconding that with the constitutions of the Kirk and lawes of the Common-wealth is divine. Dounames putting mans authority before sobriety, and charity, is humane.


Archip.
But the scandall ceaseth to be sinne, or at least to bee our sinne, when our superiours command.


Epaph.
Disobedience were unlawfull it upon commandement of our superiours the scandall either ceased to be, or ceased to be sin, or ceased to be our sinne.
But first it ceaseth not to be. For the commandement of the Magistrate maketh it the greater, as the boldnesse of the Papist, the mocking of the profane, the griefe of the godly, the superstition of the simple in these late daies haue declared, and still the more that the ceremonies be urged and received, the greater shall the offence be, and the greatest vvhen there shall be least contradiction. Next the scandall ceaseth not to be sinne, because scandall being scandall it must be sinne, as idolatry is ever idolatry, there is no dispensation of the law of nature. Thirdly, it ceaseth not to be our sinne, vvhen the sin is in modo imperandi, in the manner of commanding. The superiour may haue guiltinesse in commanding and the inferiour be innocent in obeying: but when the sinne is also in re imperata, in the thing commanded; as the matter commanded being against piety, decency or charity, the guiltinesse is on both sides.


Archip.
For removing of scandall we ought not to disobey, but to render a reason of our obedience.


Epaph.
If rendring a reason of our doing might quit us of sin, as some haue pretended, the question of things indifferent might be soone put to an end, the Apostle his doctrine abridged, and all the Christian Kirkes brought to quietnesse. But that vvhich the Schoole-men utter more obscurely, that the actions of the understanding depend upon our own will, or upon the will of others, quoad exercitium, non quoad specificationem, is clear in experience. We may make our selues or others to thinke upon the matter, but to assent or diassent it depends not upon our will. They are little exercised in catechizing of the ignorant who maintaine such grounds.


Archip.
But I am sure the commandement of the superiour at least extenuates the sinne.


Epaph.
Comparing sinne with sinne, the fault is not so great upon particular tentation, without purpose and intention to fail against the rule of Charity, or Sobriety, or Piety: as to obey a Law injoyning the practise of a thing indifferent against sobriety or charity with purpose of obedience. For in the one thou simply neglects the commandement of God, but in the other, with a soule disparagement of Antinomy, thou prefers the commandement of Man.


Archip.
Necessary duties must not be left for offence of any.


Epaph.
D. Dounam his reason taken from the distinction of necessary and arbitrary dueties can haue no place heere. For albeit communicating and preaching be necessary duties, and must be done albeit all the world should stumble, yet kneeling and comforming, which man hath made their adherents, are no necessary

duties;Dimittendum est propter sca^dalum omne quod potest pratermitt^, salva triplice veritate, scil. vita, do^trina and Instititia Hieron. gloss. ora. Tom. 9. but at the most indifferent ever in the opinion of the practisers: and therefore in the case of offence to be left. Might he not upon the same ground conclude that seeing drinking is a necessary duty, therefore rather ere I want drinke at a time I will yeeld to drinke aboue Sobriety. The offence commeth not by communicating, nor drunkennesse by drinking: but the offence commeth by kneeling, and drunkennesse by excessiue drinking.


Archip.
The great danger in this purpose is, that declyning the one extremity, ye fall into the other.


Epaph.
To tell you my mind, I acknowledge an essentiall kirk, the Congregation of the faithfull, a representatiue Kirk, the Assembly representing the Kirk essentiall. But I know no virtuall Kirk on earth: whether the Bishop of Rome, or any other man, as having in himselfe eminently and virtually (for so the Papists professe, and others in part practise) such certainty of truth, and soveraignty of judgement, that he may command what he will in any controverted matter Ecclesiasticall, whether he command that which is unlawfull, or that which is lawfull to be done in an unlawfull manner, that is against the generall rules. When Alexander the Great came to Ierusalem he desired his image to be erected in the Temple. The high Priest was willing to please him in every thing, wherein God was not displeased: and therfore refusing with all reverence that idolatry, what he might, and what served more the Kings honour he offered cheerefully. First, to beginne the accounts of their times from his entry into Ierusalem: and secondly, to name all their first borne sonnes Alexanders from him. What is civill, what domestick, what is Casars, what is ours, let them be forbidden water and fire, and their Citie sowne with salt who refuse it. Let Christs royall prerogatiue who will not giue his glory to another be kept for himselfe. May we not in so narrow a strait, where we can see no way to turne, neither to the right hand nor to the left, open our mouthes with the obedient Asse, and say, Haue we used to serue so in other matters?In Ministerio Ecclesia spectandum est and ^p^um ministerium, and persona qua eo fungitur. Quod ad personam attine^, civili potestati minister subjicitur: nam et civis est and quemadmodum alii tributum solvit, and morum censuram subit. Sed quod attinet a^ Ministerium aliqua etiam modo subitcitur Magistratui: quia si contra verbum D^i aut doceat aut adm^n ^ret sa^ ^^ia, coercibitur a civili Magistrata. Nec tamen ab eo sed a verbo Dit regulas et rationes pe^^ (...) functionis le^com. p. 902. Let other men speake for us. Jn the Ministery of the Kirk (saith P. Martyr) both the Ministery it selfe is to be considered, and the persons that heareth the function. As for the person of the minister he is subject to the Civill power, for he is a liege: he payeth tribute or taxation as others, and undergoeth the censure of manners: But as for the Ministery

it is in some sort subject to the Magistrate. For if he teach or minister the Sacraments against the word of God be is to be repressed by the Civill Magistrate: and yet not from him but from the word of God shall be seeke the rules and reasons of his function.Primum quae autoritate ex^^plove ab ductus sancta^ Dei Ecclesia^ and simplicitatem my serorum Christi (cujus solius vocem agnoscunt and sequuntur eves, quia solu^ audiri mandavit Pater, Ioan. 10 27) circumvestiundum esse putet humanis traditionibus quas repudiat Christus.

Worthy Fran. Junius layeth before the eyes of authority a threefold consideration; 1 by what authority or example is the Magistrate moved to thinke, that the holy Kirk of God, and the simplicity of the mysteries of Christ (whose voice alone his sheep know and follow, because the Father commanded that it should be heard onely, Iob. 10 27) should be clothed about with humane traditions which Christ himselfe rejecteth. 2 To what end thinketh be, that his things must be sowed unto the Ordinances of God? For if it be that she may be conforme unto others, it were more equitable that other Kirkes should conform to them who come neerest to the word of God, according to Cyprians counsell: not that they should joyne themselues to other Kirkes. If it be that all things may be more decent, what can be more decent then the simplicity of Christ? What more simple then his decency? If it be for fulfilling of his owne will let it be so. But it must be remembred that the will of God is the greatest necessity, and that the Kirk of God in things divine is not subject to the will of men. 3 What events may follow upon humane traditions, as daily experience hath shewed.


Archip.
You ever tell me what he should not doe. But I would heare somewhat positiue of his power in things Ecclesiasticall: what he should and may doe in times of contention especially.


Epaph.
That is not my part ye know: yet this I may say, that as in the matter of heresie; so in time of schisme for matters of ceremonie, the Magistrate calleth a Synode representing the whole Kirk, having power definitiue and the judgement of jurisdiction according to the vvord. Right as naturally in the soule of man, to make it plaine by comparison; the Imperiall power of the will may command the understanding, quoad exercitium, that is to pause upon a certaine purpose, and to giue her determination, but not quoad specificationem, that is to assent, or dissassent, or to determine to the one side more then the other. And as the same Will hath actum Elicitum as her essentiall and most proper operation, and actum imperatum produced by another power

of the soule at the commandement of the will, as the understanding to ponder and consider, the appetite to exercise temperance, fortitude etc. and out of her desire and choice of the soveraigne good of soule and bodie, setteth all the powers of soule and bodie to worke: Even so the Magistrate hath actum elicitum in civill affaires, his essentiall and most proper object: in the matters of Gods Kirk whether for order or jurisdiction, albeit he hath not actum elicitum, he may neither preach the word nor minister the Sacraments, not define by himselfe regularly: yet he hath actum imperatum: he may command ministers to preach the word, to celebrate the Sacraments, and to convene and determine according to the Word.


Archip.
And say you no more, Is that all?


Epaph.
And more then this. He hath in all Ecclesiasticall canons or conclusions a threefold judgement: One common as a Christian, another proper as a Magistrate, the third personall as a man singularly gifted. As a Christian, the judgement of discretion, that he beleeue not or practise any thing of all that which the Kirk concludeth, if he find it to be against the word. As a Magistrate, he must haue the judgement of his vocation to discerne what concerneth the spirituall weale and salvation of his subjects, and accordingly to adde or suspend the sanction. And as a singular Magistrate having more then ordinary gifts of knowledge and piety, he ought to haue such interest in determination and jurisdiction with the Kirk, as others who haue more then ordinary gifts.


Archip
What take ye to be the part of the Professors?Professors should haue the judgement of discretion.In verba Dei juramus simpliciter, in Ecclesiae verba (...) nempe quatenus a deo hanc potestatem accepit per verbu^ ipsius, and in^ra metas a verbo illo positas religiose se continet, Tilen. 263. Quando vel in forma Synodi vel in decisione peccatum est, ut alterutra vel neutra sit legitima, tali Synodo impune omnino contradici potest, neque recipiendum est tale Concilium, ^nno vero est nullum, irritum, nihilique faciendum Danaeus, 474. Synodi decreta etiam p^i, magistratus summi edictis sancita and confirmata ad inittenda sunt, quatenus verbo Dei consentinut.

Epaph.
Gods people when the matter co^meth to their practise, must haue the first (and further they craue not) the judgement of discretion to try the spirits whether they be of God or not. In case the Kirk whether of ignorance, or contention, or a man pleasing humour, determine in doctrine against the word, or in ceremony against the generall rules, their dutie is to obey God rather then man. He was a Pope and not a Protestant that concluded. If a beast touch the mountaine he shall die; therfore the Laicke shall not meddle with Scripture and matters of the Kirk. We know that even poor folk haue soules, and should haue knowledge and faith to saue them.



Archip.
Knowledge in the Professours is most necessary, but the smaller measure may serue if their Leaders be full of light. Albeit ye and others who stand against ceremonies haue more affection then knowledge, and more zeale then learning, (as I haue often heard you called, ignorant wilfull men, and that there is scarcely a mouth full of learning amongst you all) yet there be many great Clerk^s, and a faire procession of learned Doctors of Divinity in the Kirk of Scotland, to whose fatherly care the people may safely commit the matters of the worship of God, and of their own salvation: let them onely obey their superiours, and attend their secular affaires.


Epaph.
I like not jesting in a serious purpose. Ierome was moved to write a booke de vtris illustribus, by the like objection of the Heathen against Christians. The Papists plead their cause at some times by objecting of ignorance to the Reformed Kirkes. But I never heard it of any of our adversaries against us, except of some vaine glasterers, vvho thinke themselus learned, because their dwelling hath marched a long time with bookes and learning: and know not their own ignorance because they paine not themselues to reade and consider difficulties. Some men care not for the losse of the truth, so they may appeare learned. We stand not for our learning, so we may retaine the truth: we haue learned Christ, in comparison of whose excellencie we thinke all things losse, and are ready to defend the least and lowest h^mme of his garment, against all such Bragadochies. Albeit our Clergie hath gotten the names of the greatest Clarkes, yet never had the people more need of knowledge then now. When great titles began among the Iewish Doctors, as Orgnolam, Rabboni hakkodesh, the light of the vvorld, the holy Doctor, Vrim and Thummim, both light and holinesse was wearing away. And so was it in the Christian Kirk, when the titles of Comestor, Magister sententiarum, Doctor irrefragabilis, Doctor Seraphicus, Doctor Fundatissimus, Doctor Illuminatus, Doctor Solennis, Doctor Resolutus, Doctor Subtilis, Doctor Angelicus, etc. made men so famous. Albeit we could point at the men and the gifts amongst our selues, and say, this is Doctor Resolutus, and that is Doctor Solemnis etc. Albeit our Doctors for their subtilizing distinctions might with Antonius Pius be called Cumini sectores; so long as they stand upon their learning they would proue to the people like the Starres which giue but small light, they are so high. The Lord vvill confound the wise and learned that he may haue the glory to himselfe. When vaine imaginations, vaine altercations, vaine affectations, the three peccant humours of learning doe abound in some; and idlenesse, covetousnesse, and ambition, the threefold consumption of the

Kirk appeares in others, then is the Clergie sick, and hath need of Physicke: then haue poore people need of knowledge, and to beware of contagion. To vvhat serue the Priests roddes except they bud? The high Priest in the time of the second Temple was called Vir multarum vestium, the man with the many clothes, but he wanted the oile. We haue the man with the many cloathes (...) with great pompe, but the oile is dryed up. The golden girdle that had wont to be about the pappes soon after the reformation, is now slacked and sliding down towards the loines, where it was before, Reu. 15 6: The sea of glasse and chrystall is beginning to be muddy, and to be turned into bloud, because of this mountaine of Episcopacie, and preferment that is cast into it, Revel. 8 8. And therfore if ever at any time since the reformation, our people haue need at this time of the judgment of discretion.Institutio. Iussio. Observatio. And now to close this point of Ecclesiastick co^stitutions I wish you and all others, by holy judgement to discerne of the first institution of these ceremonies; that therby ye may judge of the following ratification, and of your own observation. I haue shewed you that they are not in nature indifferent, and giving them to be indifferent, that the Apostolick rules are not kept. And therefore albeit the conclusion of that Assembly were Ecclesiasticall and publick in respect of the persons assembling, seeing it is not Ecclesiasticall and publick ratione modi and medii, in respect of the manner and meane used to bring on the conclusion, but in that respect civill and private, how can it be counted Ecclesiasticall. No man at that time durst so much as pretend piety, decency, or charity. The Kings pleasure, the averting or preventing of the kings wrath; what shall become of your Kirk, if the King countenance it not (such a Theologicall and inartificiall arguments as his Majestie never did use in any Assembly, and could not haue heard with patience) caryed the conclusion. As the interpretation of Scripture, which is onely private ratione personae, in respect of the person interpreting, and not in respect of the manner and meanes of interpretation is not to be judged the interpretation of a private spirit: so upon the contrary, the conclusion of persons Ecclesiasticall, proceeding from a private or civill cause, cannot be esteemed Ecclesiasticall.Lex humana qu^^^ e^ ^uadi^^^ vi^tu^^ obligandi^n^^ hab^t cu^^a co^muni b^n^ deficit. The conclusion can haue no greater force nor no other quality, but that which it receiveth from the reason whereupon it depends. He that striveth to demonstrate a supernaturall conclusion by a naturall reason, bringeth forth nothing but a naturall conclusion. If the first institution be not sound, the following ratification can giue no new right; and therefore the observation must be unlawfull.


Archip.
In this third Evangelicall and Christian determination,

ye haue spoken of Divine institutions, and of Ecclesiasticall constitutions,Humane inuentions in the Christian Kirk. I would heare now what ye are to say of Humane inventions succeeding in the Christian Kirk to Pharifaicall conceits in the Iewish Kirk.


Epaph
They would all suddenly evanish if the word of Christ were obeyed in his own house. The lines and cords of mens wit that creep in and rap out may serue for civill and secular mets and merches. But as the Temple was met with a reed, so hath the Lord ordained a golden reed for the measure of the Sanctuary. In all Planets coniunction is most amiable except the Sun, which is good by aspect but evill by coniunction. When man presumeth to equall his ceremonies with divine Institutions, and to set down a positiue worship with the worship of God, that marreth all.


Archip.
That is the sacrilegious boldnesse and presumption of the Romane Kirk; all the reformed Kirkes abhor wilworship.


Epaph.
I wish it were so indeed. The more learned of the Papists make three sort of ceremonies: some to be the efficient causes of grace, as the Sacraments: some to remoue the impediments of grace, as the signe of the crosse, holy water etc: and some to serue for comelynesse and order. They confesse that the Kirk hath no power to institute ceremonies of the first sort, but of the second and third onely. Againe, the Defenders of our ceremonies stand onely for the third sort in word, but agree indeed with the Papists, as appeareth two wayes. 1 They take in under the name of rites, for order and decency, many of the second sort of Popish ceremonies, vvhich the Papists make forcible to remoue impediments. And whatsoever is pretended, it is well enough known of the Crosse, Surplice, Holydaies etc. that they are superstitiously used, vvheresoever they haue place; and more ascribed to them then to Christs own Ordinances. 2 Vnder the name of rites serving for decency and order, they take in all such ceremonies, as they thinke may adde or lend ornament unto the worship of God, as is manifest out of the doctrine and very definitions of things indifferent,Traditionum non potest esse certus numerus, ut quae actu multa sunt potentia infinitae.Quod fuit serinium pectoris Pontificii hoc nunc est locus de traditionibus non scriptis. Traditionum humanarum observatio est ^^teruma religionis pestis vulumsque conscientiarum. written by Meisnerus and Puel in diverse Kirks. A wide dore for the entry of the whole multitude and theatricall pompe of popish rites, the destroyers of the simplicity of the Gospell; and like clouds without raine promising that which they giue not, and which should be sought and is to be found in the Ordinances of Christ. Till this dore of Traditions be shut, mens inventions will be ever intruding themselues, take the place of divine institutions, and more and more be multiplied.



Archip.
I vvil the more confidently lippen to the grounds, which I haue learned from you concerning the nature and use of things indifferent; vvhen I haue knowne that yee haue tried their stabilitie by the opposition of contrarie forces, especially of that man to whom all our reverend Fathers, and learned Doctors give acclamation of a grand Sophos in the ceremoniall cause.Trial of the foresayd grounds by contrarie obiections.


Epaph.
Who is that? For all our domestick Writers are soone seene.


Archip.
I meane by him vvho first wrot a resolution for the ministerie, under the name of D. Lindesay, and now his (...) and second care of ceremonies vvith a parenetick to the Ministers of the Kirke of Scotland,(...). vnder the name of David Brechin.


Epaph.
Ye may know by the change of his name, the effects of his resolution. The operation of it hath been greater ad intra then ad extra; His exhortation to the ministers concerneth us and our purpose most, because we are of that number, and it advanceth the power of the kirk in things indifferent. As he may vvel vvant opinions to defend by arguments, but (vvhich vvas the cunning of Chrysippus) he never wanted arguments for defence of his opinions. His Parenetick had been the more pithie, and his whole proceedings the more plain, if he had first set down the state of the question in the vvords of his own probleme, vvhich he subjoyned to his Thesis disputed at Saintandrowes, vvhen he vvas to be graced, but could not passe the presse vvith priviledge: Whether things indifferent once abused, and for their abuse abolished, etc. Negat. He could then giue a defiance to all the English Doctors, but the world hath made him vviser since. Secondly, if he had expressed plainly in his exhortation to the Ministers, vvhat vvas the onely argument of his persuasion to enter and proceed in that course; nothing but a Bishoprick, vvhich he vvas vvont to professe as ordinarily in privat as he spake openly in publick, that he knew neither Scripture, reason, nor antiquitie for kneeling; albeit now his birse rise vvhen he heareth the one, and for cloking the other, his pen hath changed for into inforce, as nighest in sound, and therfore a better excuse then that vvhich he gaue out first, Albeit there were neither scripture. etc. And thirdly, if for conclusion he had shewn his brethren some overture, for obedience, like that vvhich he once proponed to himself, and talked of to others, that he could so dress the matter, that his people of Dundie should hold themselues within the close seats about the vvalles of the new Kirke, and never be knowen vvhether they sate or kneeled, belike hee thought not at that time that sitting fostered profanitie and superstition in all, as he sayth, pag. 5. Or at least, if in dealing vvith his brethren, hee had

remembred vvhat hee vvas once, and almost even now himselfe, and pitied his owne vvonted,Illi in vos saevient qui nullo tali errore decepti sunt, quali vos deceptos vident. Ego autem in vos savire omnino non possum, quos ficut incipsum illo tempore ita nunc debeo sustinere and tanta patientia vobiscum agere quanta mecum egerunt proximi mei cum in vestro dogmate rabiosus and ^cus errarem. nay his late case in our persons, as Augustine did the Manicheans, greater heretickes then he thinketh us. Let them (sayth he) be rigorous against you, who never were deceived with the like errour as they see you. As for me, I can vse no bitternesse against you, with whom I should beare now, as I did at that time with my selfe, and deale in as great patience with you, as my neighbours vsed towards me when I was in your errour. But vvhat hope was there of moderation from his heart and hands afterward, vvho at the first putting off his wit of ceremonies in print, began vvith the ominous change of Disce pati, into Dissipate, of patience into persecution: vvherein his thankfull Patron willing to do him one good turne for another, and himselfe so forward in the cause, haue given good proof how vvorthy they are of their New Motto.


Archip.
I perceiue you are acquaint vvith the purpose; what say you to his preface concerning the extent of the power of the Kirke? thinke ye his grounds sure enough?


Epaph.
Compare them with that vvhich yee haue heard, and ye shall know there is nothing left to the kirks power in the circumstances vvhich could conveniently be determined by the word, more then vvas left to the kirk of the Iewes, albeit the determination be not so particular, becau^^ the one kirk was Oecumenical throughout the vvhole vvorld, the other national in one countrey. 1. For persons bearing office in the kirke, no nation, nor tribe, nor family could be designed more then another, Quod est a re non a voluntate legislatoris. Yet the distinction of the bounds belonging to everie synagogue, vvas left to the power of the kirk of the Iewes, no lesse then the distinction of Parishes now to the Christian kirke; and all the distinct office-bearers are prescribed now as well as then. As unlawfull now to bring in a new kinde of ministerie into the kirke, as it vvas at that time; and will prove in the end to be no better then strange fire. 2. For places, there cannot be a common place now for solemne vvorship: for either there behoved to be one for the vvhole Christian vvorld, vvhich no man vvill affirme, except a Roman Catholick; or else one in every nation, vvhich vvere the erecting of a proper religion in everie kingdome, and a making of everie countrey a Canaan by it selfe, and not a part of the kirk vniversall, having communion with all the Saints. But as the Kirk now hath a place of meeting for every congregation, so had the Iewish kirk the like power and libertie in building their synagogues; and no greater holines in the one place then in the other 3. For times, in vindicating his festivall dayes from the blame of Iudaisme; he denieth that the kirk hath power to make dayes like the Iewish dayes, in appropriating a vvorship to them,

vvhich is not lawfull to performe another day: but seemeth to slip in two things. 1. that hee giveth power to the kirke to make dayes as holy as that day, vvhich is more holy then the Iewish dayes, putting no difference of holinesse betwixt the Sabboth and the dayes appointed by the kirk; but maketh all the difference to be divine institution. As D. Downame precept. 4. addeth to the vveekly Sabboths all other Sabboths lawfully ordained by the kirk, All which are to bee consecrated (sayth hee) as Sabboths to the Lord. And for example of Sabboths lawfully ordained, he bringeth the feasts of Christs Nativitie, Resurrection, etc. giving power to the kirk to make Sabboths, like Gods Sabboths. 2. He slippeth in his appropriations; of the two sorts of it he striveth to remoue the one, that is, the appropriation of the worship to the day, albeit he knoweth that it would not be counted lawfull to solemnize the feast of the Nativitie, Resurrection, etc. upon other dayes; the solemne remembrance of these benefites being the proper vvorship of the dayes, and not the instruction of the people in the grounds of the Catechisme. The solemne vvorship of the Passouer, Pentecost, and Tabernacles, was appropriated to the owne times, yet it vvas lawfull to instruct the people in the knowledge of the benefites at other times. The other appropriation of the day to the vvorship, he passeth vvith silence, as that it made not a Iudaicall difference of dayes When I say, it is not lawfull to exercise that vvorship another day, and to exercise another vvorship that day, I make difference of dayes both wayes. As I doe of meates, vvhen I say out of a religious distinction of meats, I will eat any meat except that; and no other meat but that. Had it beene the Lords will that his people should haue kept anniversarie and ordinarie feasts, seeing they were no lesse positiue, and might haue been as easily determined as the weekly Sabboths, he had not passed them vvithout determination. Finally, all that he hath set down concerning order, is no more determined in the kirk of the Iewes, then in the Christian kirk: as vvherat, and how the Priest or Levit should begin, proceed, close, Psalmes, praying, reading, preaching; what petition to bee proponed, circumcision in stead of baptisme, the passover in place of the communion, marriage and all things in doctrine, discipline and divine service. What hath the Doctor meaned when he tooke upon him the demonstration of Christian libertie in this poynt, except he could haue brought better instances. There were many poynts of service, as sacrifices, vvashings, anniversarie dayes, etc. vvhich we haue not; but the determination of such as we haue, is as particular as theirs, except vvherein the nationall circumstances make impediment. They had multitude of observations with direction; wee haue the benifit of distinct

direction without the burthen of multitude of observations.


Archip.
If he had vvell paralelled the Iewish and Christian kirk in the particulars, he had not set down that for a priviledge, and libertie of the Christian kirk, vvhich is so manifestly common to the kirk of the old testament. What think ye of the extent of the power of the kirk as he hath considered it?


Epaph.
Some things are essentiall, some things vniversall in time and place; both are determined. The individuall circumstances of particular times, places, and personall conditions pro re nata, are left to the kirk; even as in policie, oeconomie, etc. some poynts must be left, because they either cannot or need not be determined. In his discourse upon this poynt he proveth vvorthy of his wages; because in the enumeration of ceremonies, he forgets the Surplice and Crosse, left he should crosse his paterne in any thing, and to giue proofe of his purpose of more conformitie. Albeit he cannot deny, but the crosse, surplice, etc. vvhich he dare not remember* are new rites, sensible and as dangerous additions, and no lesse positiue in the vvorship of God, then salt, oyle, spittle, holy warter, lights. God giue you and all the ministers of the Kirk of Scotland, the spirit of discretion, vvhen ye set your selues down at the feet of your generall Preceptor and preceptorie Dictator, to learn rules of obedience in matters indifferent. If obedience be due to the kirke because therby confusion; scandall and schisme is eschued: then vvhere all these evills through obedience do daily encrease, obedience to the kirk is disobedience to God. And vvhether it be lawfull to enquire, and to haue respect to scandall, after that the Canon is concluded, I referre you to that vvhich I sayd before of scandall.


Arch.
All that you can say against his preface, and the book it self, wil seem as smal in his phantasie as the Rhapsodie of Perth assembly, against which he and his fellow-labourers framed this answer.


Epaph.
Not the phantasie of man, but the veritie of God is to be respected of us. He calleth that treatise a Rhapsodie, for what cause I know not, except that the author delighteth not after his fashion to Mercurialize, and borroweth help of the Ancients, of the Scholastickes, and modern Divines. Who loveth not the exquisite Bee-work gathered out of so great diversitie of flowers more then the spiders webb twisted out of her own bowells; vvhich striveth for nothing but to catch the blind and vveak flies, when she hath eviscerate herselfe all the yeare long.


Archip.
Will ye speak nothing of the particulars contained in the book it selfe.


Epaph.
Ye haue driven me further already then I intended at the first. Particular polemicks are to be referred to their own lists, yet

I could shew you by a claw or two that ye need not fear the Lyon. In the first words of his answer to the Epistle to the reader (if the answer be his) he denieth that the externall vvorship of God, and government of the kirk shall ever die till the vvorld be done, how sick soever they be. He is either very simple if he think, that any man meaneth, that in the kirk vniversal, the vvorship external shal perish; or very sencelesse if he deny that it may die in particular kirks, vvhich is the authors meaning, as is evident to the barnliest reader, by the words immediatly following; or most malitious and sycophanticall in abusing his adversarie and the reader against his knowledge through studie of contradiction. Who could looke for such a stumble in the threshold Cantherius in porta.


Archip.
I remember of one ground vvhich he beateth vpon continually, and many thank him for it, as freeing them from the guiltine e of their oath (albeit they had done against their former practise before their knowledge of this evasion) and bringing the periurie upon you and all their opposites. It is taken out of the first confession of faith, Art. 21. Not that we think that any policie, and one order in ceremonies can be appointed for all ages, times and places. But that they may and ought to be changed, etc. Of this sort he taketh to be sitting at the communion, etc. because it is not iudged a necessarie, but convenient ceremonie.


Epaph.
There be two sorts of Ecclesiastick ceremonies, some are determinable by a generall law throughout the Christian world, or vniversal kirk; al which are determined in the word, and therfore are necessarie; some again are national, temporall, local, individual, etc. left to the determination of particular kirks, according to the generall rules, and therfore changeable, as is contained in the article. 2. there is a twofold convenience of ceremonies, according to the foresaid two kinds of ceremonies, the one essentiall, the other accidentall; the one is internall or intrinsecall from divine institution, the other external framed to circumstances. Now let him who hath most hardned his heart in that course, judge betwixt him and God, whether the one conveniencie or the other be meant, vvhen sitting is judged to be most convenient: seeing it is not sayd most convenient without any further, or most convenient to the times, or to the present constitution of the kirk, as the Bish. vvould haue it, vvhile he boasteth of this so often, saying, that which at one time is more convenient, at another time may be lesse convenient. But it is expresly sayd, Most convenient to the institution, vvhich in all times and places is the same, neither can there be any thing most convenient to the institution at one time in one place, and not most convenient at another time in another place. The day is coming wherin thanks given for this sort of evasions, shall turne into bitter complaints.



Archip.
I haue holden you so long, and ye haue sayd so much beyond my expectation in my first and greatest difficultie concerning the appearance of the indifferencie of the controverted ceremonies, that I am almost at my wits end; and I know ye are so wearied, that I cannot put you to further paines in the remanent difficulties, vvhich are not so materiall


Epaph.
I would to God that ye and all others were both almost and altogether at their wits end by solid resolution.The second difficultie answered. If my paines can be profitable to that end, care ye not for my wearying. I remember your second difficultie vvas that the ceremonies are concluded in kirk and parliament upon religious and reasonable pretexts, vvhich I cannot deny; if ye meane pretexts of religion and reason, yee may remember first, that the narratiue is onely the pretext, but authoritie is the cause of the conclusion. In reasoning and voting for the articles, no mention of reverence of religion, of reason, but frequent mention of authoritie. In the narratiue of the acts, never a word of authority, but of reverence, religion, reason. That pastors and people vvho either vvere not present, or shall succeed hereafter, looking upon the acts as they are conceived; may think that it was not humane, but divine authoritie, not violence but reason that caried the conclusion. 2. That plausible narratiues are but weak reasons in his eyes, vvho can discern betwixt colours and causes, substances and shadowes. A wittie head never wanted a circumstance to his tale, nor a pretext to his purpose. Men are more troubled to bring things to passe, then to find out pretences. When the notary is once resolved to make a false instrument, hee knoweth it must begin with In Dei nomine Amen. Augustine sayth that in his time theeues going out under night to steale, used first to guard themselues with the signe of the crosse. Pirats haue their prayers as wel as the honest marchants on whom they prey. Nero in slaying his mother, and Caracalla in slaying his brother Geta, had their owne special pretexts, according to Machiavels direction; and the tempter could alledge scripture against Christ.


Archip.
These are odious comparisons, and answer not to my meaning.


Epaph.
I make no comparison, but I answer to your generall of pl^usible pretences. Ye may be any thing that the world will, if ye suffer your mind to be casten in that modell. The Apostle Col. 2. giveth two notes of will-worship, which may easily blind the simple; appearance of wisdome and shew of humility. But true vvorship is vvise and humble indeed, because it is the vvisedome and obedience of God. The vvorldling first layeth downe the conclusion, and then finds out the pretext. But the godly first seeth the cause, and then the conclusion. In the one, the vvill runneth before the right wit,

and affection forceth reason. In the other, inlightned reason leadeth the vvill and affections. The one is persuaded before he be informed, the other first informed, and then persuaded. And ever the more knowledge and the lesse conscience we find in any age, vve may look for the fairer pretences, and the fouler conclusions. I might soone close your mouth in this matter by examples out of Ecclesiasticall historie. But that the recording of some subtill pretexts, might perhaps lead unstable soules into great dangers.


Archip.
The danger is greater in suppressing them; for I must confesse, that the most part for their direction in a matter of religion, try not the reasons vvhereupon it is grounded; but content themselues vvith any pretext or shift, that they may haue for honesties cause when their vvorldly estate or hopes are in hazard.


Epaph.
It may be seen how faire colours haue painted foule errors (even of Paganisme it selfe) by the Apologies of Christians vvritten against the Gentiles, as of Iustinus, Clemens Alexandrinus, Tertullian, Arnobius, Minutius Foelix, Lactantius, Iosephus against Appion, Gregorie Nazianzen against Iulian, Eusebius, etc. Symmachus in that one Epistle vvritten to Valentinian, Theodosius and Arcadius giveth proofes vvhat may be said in a bad cause. Durandi rationale is demonstratiue for Popish practise; and how the Iesuits of late haue shaken a Minerva out of their braines, for maintaining multitudes of monsters, I referre to your selfe; and vvill giue but two instances of our purpose, one of heresie under the Gospell, another of idolatry under the Law.


Archip.
That vvere sufficient, vvhat heresie meane you?


Epaph
Never was there an heretick that defended a more pestilent opinion with more plausible pretexts,Pretexts for Arrianisme. and subtil evasions then Arrius and his sectaries: for vvhen they were desired to acknowledge Christ to be the son of God, as he is called in the Creed, they accepted of that word, because the Apostle sayth, We are all the sonns of God. When they vvere assayed vvith the word onely begotten, they received it, meaning of that dignitie and singular glory in him aboue all the creatures beside. And to this end alledged the known place Prov. 8. (...) for (...). Thirdly, there was added, Before the world was made. This they exponed of the creation of Christ and all the Angels before the vvorld vvas made. The fourth addition, God of God, they escaped by acknowledging all the Angells also to bee Gods of God. And the fift, light of light, they esteemed to be common to all the godly. Ye are the light of the world, once darknes, but now light. When sixtly they excluded adoption by adding, True God of the true God, that they admitted also, because the true uncreated God cannot be the author nor maker of false Gods. When seventhly for stopping of this starting hole it was added, Begotten

not made, they escaped by the place of Deuteronomie, Thou hast forsaken the God who begat thee. Never could this monster of heresie be catched by co^fessio^ of faith, til at last the kirk was led by the spirit to the vvord (...), vvhich in end proved to be the Shibboleth. As the other three words (...), vvere used by other three councels against the other three kinds of heresies, concerning the person of Christ, God-man.


Archip.
I perceiue that Heretickes and Polititians vvere not shepheards of Colliers of old, more then the learned seducers in out dayes: that it is hard to frame a confession of faith, vvhich they vvill refuse to subscribe; and yet for any contrarie errour or practise, can soone find some evasion: and that no heresie nor errour ever wanted the owne probabilitie and pretext. Come now to the second instance.


Epaph.
It is the Idolatry of Ieroboam, which might haue been defended or excused by the kirk and state of that time; as well as the Idolatry of this age by the authoritie and Clergie now.


Archip.
Idolatry aboue all other sinnes is the service of the Divells. Idolatry is that to the all seeing iealous God, vvhich adulterie is to a loving and iealous husband committed in his owne sight. Idolls are things of naught, dung, excrements, sorrowes, abhominations, vanities, lies. Idolaters of all sinners haue the threatning and execution of the greatest iudgements; in this life diseases of all kindes, Levit. 26. vvithout respect of persons, 2. Chron. 21.18.19. famine for many yeares, 1. King. 17. the sword, Levit. 26.26. the desolation of Cities, and scattering of the inhabitants among other nations. All vvhich came to passe in particular upon Israell. In the vvorld to come they shall not inherite the Kingdome of God. And all that are of their fellowship shall be confounded, Es 44 11. Ieroboam could tell this full well; he heard himselfe rebuked by the Prophet, he felt his arme miraculously first dryed up and then cured againe: he saw vvith his eyes the Altar rent, he lost in one battell fiue hundreth thousand chosen men, 2 Chron. 13 17, and the children of Iudah prevailed because they relyed upon the Lord God of their fathers, ver. 18, his sonne Abijah was taken from him, and Gods hand was still against that house till it vvas sweeped out from the ground. I am sure he could haue no excuse for his sinn.


Epaph.
Idolatry hath this evill beside other evils, and aboue the evill of other sinnes, that no man confesseth himselfe to be an idolater, or his vvorship to be idolatry: but ostinately defends, disputes, preacheth, writeth, persecuteth for it; closeth his heart against whatsoever can be said from the word of the Lord against it, and sets his ^it on edge to devise pretences, and find out shifts to excuse it.



Archip.
What could Ieroboams Priests or Polititians say for him and his worship?


Epaph.
The truth is,Pretexts (...) Ieroboams idolatry. that his desire to confirme the Kingdome to himselfe, feare of the alienation of the peoples hearts in case they were suffered to resort to Ierusalem, want of faith to beleeue the promise of God, and to seek counsell of him prevailed so far with him, and with the estates of the Kingdome, that they resolved to set up a worship of their own, not like that of Iudab. And vvhen the Priests and Levits, according to their duety, resisted the novation, as liking better of their better warranted old profession: both they, and some of all the Tribes of Israel following the voyce of God in their mouthes, were hardly intreated, vvhereupon there arose a great schisme: The men of Iudah and some of Israel, objected that they had forsaken God; but the most part of Israel judged them to be renters of the unity of the Kirk, rebells against the King, who was advanced by the Lord beside all expectation: vvas their lawfull Prince peaceably disposed, contenting himselfe with his own Kingdome, providing for the good estate of his own people, and using all meanes that they follow not other gods; and esteemed them to be superstitious Precisians in standing out against so gracious a King, commanding nothing against any article of faith, against any fundamentall point of salvation, detesting the Gods of the Nations, and all kinde of idolatry. The matters he urged were but circumstantiall, rituall and variable, and such as the best Kings, having the Lords approbation, had changed before. They could say that the worship vvas the same in substance, that they served the same God who brought them out of Egypt, with the sacrifices and observation of all the statutes kept by all the fathers since the beginning of the world. That their Bullockes, which Precisians called idols were similitudes representing the onely sacrifice of the Messiah in whom they looked for salvation. Were there not Cherubines in the Tabernacle and Temple, and twelu Oxen or Buls of brasse appointed by the wisest King? The Lord forbiddeth such images onely as haue divine worship done unto the^; like the Calfe in the wildernes, turning the glory of God into the similitude of a bullock that eateth grasse. But they could say, that they worshipped not these Calues more then the images of the Cherubines. Are we so grosse when we say. Behold our Gods, as to think that they brought us out of Egypt? We speake figuratiuely, as the Arke vvas called the King of Glorie, and the holy Lord God. Wee vvill rather giue our liues, lands, libertie and all, then commit Idolatry for the pleasure of any Prince; and doe abhorre the abuse of Images, vvhich is to bow down and serue them; albeit we be

not of that mind but we may haue them and worship God by them; because we know no place of Scripture to the contrary. The place of worship is but a circumstance; and to tie Gods presence to any place, who is neere in all times and places to them that call upon him is superstition. The Arke was not ever in one place but often removed. In Salomons own time there was two publick places of Gods worship, and Salomon sacrificed in them both. Is not the whole land holy? The promise made to Salomon of a speciall presence at Ierusalem, was tyed to the condition of keeping his Statutes and Iudgements, wherein he hath failed. And therefore as his Throne is thrown down, which the Lord at the same time promised to establish, so hath the place lossed the priviledge of holinesse. We may plead from Antiquity: for heere is Bethel, so famous for that glorious testimony of his presence given to Iacob, from whom we this day haue the name of Israel. Rehoboam is no wiser then his father, he may fall into his Idolatry, and so Israel by resorting to Ierusalem may be snared. All danger of Idolatry would be prevented, the poore people eased of their tedious journies, and both Prince and people saved from Rhehoboams conspiracy. All this dinne and division proceedeth of the humours of some contentious and avaritious Levits, seducing the simple people, making them to thinke that God cannot be served but in Ierusalem after their fashion in every circumstance and particular ceremony: and of the doting of some persons of the weakest wit and sex, delighting to goe abroad, to be talked of for zeale, and more pleased with any worship then that which they haue at home. The observation of the Feast of Tabernacles upon the 15 day of the 8 month, is but the change of a circumstance of time. The day was made for man, and not man for the day. It was lawfull by Gods own warrant to keep the Passeover on the 14 day of the second month; he careth not for the month so the day be kept. It is presumption to alter things substantiall in matters of faith or doctrine: but superstition to stand upon circumstances and variable ceremonies. What can be done, the Lords worship cannot be neglected. If the Priests of Levi make it nice, will still proue contentious, and lead a faction with them for strengthning the Kingdome of Iudah, upon warrant of Antiquity, before the distinction of Levi was made for orders sake, others of other Tribes, as vvell qualified as themselues must be put in their places, and they put away as Abiathar was by Salomon, because he had his hand with Adoniiah. It may be vvhen they see their places well filled, and the charity of profuse people, which cannot last long to decay, that their giddiness goe away, and they returne to their right wits. The Prophet that came to the King

when his hand dryed up, might haue beene a Witch comming vvith lying vvonders, for he vvas slaine by a Lyon: and howsoever he threatned destruction he condescended upon no time, left he should haue been convinced of a lye. Abijah dealt not with the King in meeknesse and sincerity as became a Prophet; but by his bitternesse and passion declared that that he vvas partially inclyned to Iudah. Abijah dyed not before his day. All things come alike to the godly and to the vvicked, to him that sacrificeth and him that sacrificeth not. Or if his death vvas untimous it was rather for his secret intentions crossing his fathers courses, then for any good that was in him towards the God of Israel, as the Prophet would haue it.


Archip.
You need to goe no further. I haue often thought upon the Idolatrie of Ieroboam, but never could know what pretexts he could devise to make all Israel to sinne. And upon the contrary we are blinded, and consider never the pretexts of the idolaters of our times, but are miscarryed with their Idolatrie, albeit it equall, if it exceed not that of Jeroboam. All men are more equall Iudges of other times then of their own. They can admire the vertues, and condemne the sinnes of old, or in other places at this time: but can neither discerne the one nor the other in the present time amongst themselues. It is easie to finde out a Since or a Forasmuch, etc. to begin an Article with, when so much may be said for the greatest abominations. Shall I never by Gods grace suffer my eyes to be dazeled with the beauty of colours as I haue done. For all pretences vvil proue but fig tree leaues when the Lord vvho vvill not be mocked, cryeth to the fugitiue conscience where art thou? And I thinke as little now of my third difficulty of promise, that no more shall be urged upon the Kirk heereafter.


Epaph.
It were good to examine the particular pretences expressed in the actes concluding the fiue Articles, but that is done already: And ye may guesse by the first and greatest what stuffe is to be found in the rest: 1 The place of the 95 Psalm which is alledged commandeth not when we come to worship God that we fall etc. for so kneeling vvere commanded in every exercise of Gods vvorship: and it vvere against Gods commandement to vvorship him vvithout falling down and kneeling. 2 Our Kirk used not sitting since the Reformation of Religion, because kneeling vvas abused, but because it vvas most convenient to the Institution of Christ, as is declared before. 3 Whither the memory of by past or the sense and multiplication of present superstition may not be a better pretence for the contrary conclusion. I feare the times shall giue reply to your third Argument: and I vvish that the

answer of the third difficultie vvere more difficill than (...).The third difficultie answered. It is the prerogatiue of the promises of God to be beleeved aboue experience, sense and reason; vve ought to judge of their verity by the judgment of infallibility, of mens persons by the judgment of charity, and of mens speeches and promises, by the judgement of prudence.Iudicium Veritatis, Cha^^atis and Prudentiae. Christian prudence looketh back upon this course to the very beginning, considereth how it is still working, and seeth the future effects alreadie present in the causes. As there is great difference bewixt one broken linck, and the whole golden chaine of Gods providence; so one ceremony is but a small part of the mysterie of iniquity. I would know vvhat it is to resist the beginning of evill; and vvhether the posterity may justly blame the predecessors, for giving vvay to mischievous practises.Prastate ero nos ut ea que pueri suscepimus, senes posteris reliuquamus ne quid futura aetas inveniat corrigendum. It was well said by Symmachus though in a bad cause, Doe so I pray you, that the things wee haue received when wee were children, we may transmit to the posterity when we become old, that the following age may finde nothing to be amended. Men may promise little for themselues, albeit their intention vvere answerable to their profession, lesse for their superiours whom they dare not challenge, least of all for Satan, who hath the warp of defection rolled up in secret upon the beame of his hellish project, and employeth one malignant wit after another to make out the web, by Gods just judgement ever plaguing former defections with following Apostasie. Never man made count of such promises, but he who first laid his count to keep the vvorld in all cases of the Kirk, that he might haue something to say for his honestie before the world, rather then for the peace of his conscience before God, in vvhose dreadfull sight who dare appeare vvith the vveak promises of sinfull men against his infallible verities?Fourth difficulty of hard success removed.

Archip.
When all my forces vvere mustered together in the beginning they made some shew: but now vvhen they are severally provoked to the conflict they bewray their weakenesse: my last souldier called hard successe, dare not set out his head.


Epaph.
His name should not be heard in a cause of this quality. Care of duety belongeth to us, care of successe to God, and not to us. Luther had not been the right man if he had been ruled by feare of events, vvhen it was said to him in sad earnest, Brother, brother take you to your Cloister, and pray to God to help you. Policie hath so farre prevailed vvith M. Sprint that he hath found a false key to open a gate for many to enter vvithin the threshold of ceremonies in case of deprivation, and a back dore to escape by in case of reformation, that his man shall ever fall on his feet. But piety is no temporizer, and in all times of heresie, profanity, impiety, looks to the will of God to doe it for a good successe, and

(...) first or last. All difficulties are not impossible ^t^er, and many naturall and morall impossibilities proue demonstrations of his power, with whom nothing is impossible. All hearts are in Gods hand, either converting or changing vvhom he converteth not, or restraining vvhom he changeth not, or at least ruling and governing to good ends whom he restraineth not. Ecclesiasticall history points at sixe notable changes of the Christian Kirk, every one of the first fiue including three hundred yeares. In the first three centuries, Piety, simplicity, martyrdomes abounded under persecution. In the next three, by occasion of heresies, learning increased. After that, for three hundred yeares, supremacie and primacie prevailed in the Kirk. The fourth three yeeres was a time of soveraignty and domination over saecular Princes and Emperours. The last period of the same extent was a time of Mammon and heaping up of riches. At last in the sixteenth hundreth yeare when Kirkmen had no further to aime at: vvhen the unkindly daughter had devoured the mother, and every one vvas saying in his own bosome, my soule take the ease; then it pleased the Lord from heaven to pitie his own Kirk in working that blessed reformation, never at any time before so much desired and so little expected. Our Nationall Kirk (so like is she unto her mother during these sixtie yeeres past) hath experienced the like diversitie. We had in the beginning a time of martyrdom, vvith great power and simplicity of the Gospell: a second time of learning abounding with a greater number of Doctors indeed, then this time doth with titles: soone after succeeded a time of primacie, vvhen Pastors sought after preferment aboue their brethren: When that vvas obtained they rested not till in the fourth time they were preferred to the Nobles and Seculars of the land: And now in the fift time, sitting in the highest chaires of honor, they leaue no meane unassayed by taxes and taxations, by plots and pluralities,Pauper Episcopus, Pauperio^ Cardinalis. Pauperimus Papa. by simonie and legacie of the quick and of the dead to multiply vvealth, howbeit some of them find the successe of Alexander the fift. Why then may we not hope, whatsoever be the present course of second causes, for a reformation, except the feare of worldly shame and skaith in the particulars remembred in the end of your third demand, make us all to fall away, and there be few or none to stand in the gap.


Archip.
The danger is great; for the aspersions are very contumelious, and the incommodities greevous, that I feare few shall be able to beare them with courage.


Epaph.
He that seemeth to be a ceremoniall Confessour hath the lesse evidence that he shall proue a substantiall Martyr. We haue not so much to regard what is said, as how true it is; nor

what we shall suffer, as vvhat vve haue deserved. Against them (...) vve might make reply in the vvords of the vvorthiest instruments that haue lived in the Kirk of God after the Apostles, vvho haue been burthened vvith the same and other like imputations. And vvhat is true may be better known then by the slanders of our enemies. 1 By our doctrine of obedience to all our lawfull Superiours. 2 By our practise, vvherein vve haue altered nothing since the time vve vvere esteemed obedient to our superiours; Peace-keepers and peace-makers in the Kirk, and enemies to Papists. 3 By our abhorring the name of Puritanes, vvhich that sect of Heretickes affected, and vvhich the Papists first brought upon us, as the name of Calvina-papistae upon our Opposites, to make our Religion the more odious. And 4 by our unwillingnesse to be shut out of our particular residencies, so long as we are suffered to be faithfull in them, by such as are resident in place, but non-residents in office; leaving their flockes, following after the vvorld, fostering others like unto themselues, requiring of Intrants subscription for qualification, and sending the best qualified spirits, because they haue not learned to subscribe, to hang up their harpes on the vvillow trees; and their silver trumpets prepared for the Temples, about the unworthy walles of other professions.


Archip.
I know it vvas given forth of the holy Apostle, that he turned Christian for a vvorldly respect. That Wickliffe finding himselfe disappointed of a Bishoprick, became a Schismatick. That Iohn Husse, Ierome of Prage, and Luther all three fell into apostasie because they wanted preferment: yet so mighty was the Lords assisting grace, that they through good and evill report kept the truth, pressed hardly towards the marke: But alas what are vve, whether Pastors or Professours able to beare?


Epaph.
If we suffer not greater things for Christ, we are not vvorthy of him: If all make defection our desolation shall be exemplarie. As in the privation naturall there is no regresse to the habit, so Courtiers for the most part find it in the Politicall: others Kirks haue felt it, and we may look for it in the spirituall privation. The Kirk that the Lord speweth out is under a dreadfull and desperate course. 1 Because he plagueth them vvith delight, and will so rejoyce to destroy them and cut them off, as he did before rejoyce in doing the^ good: 2 because that vomiting imports that he vvill make them a reproach: and 3 because they shall never recover their wonted dignity; for the Lord vvill not returne to his vomit. Gods goodnesse towards us hath been more then ordinary, our sinnes already committed are not common; because vve goe on in a course not of ignorance or infirmity, but in obstinate

(...) many warnings of the (...) the vvorkes of God. In the land of uprightnesse will ye deale unjustly, and will ye not behold the Majestie of the Lord? There be many this day vvho maintaine the same opinions that the fathers defended of old, yet that which vvas onely errour in the fathers is in them heresie. Origen and Tertullian were so highly respected in their time, that Vincentius Lyrinenfis counteth the one the chiefe of the Greeks, and the other of the Latine Fathers: And yet their followers who vvith pertinacy persisted in their errours, against manifested truth, vvere judged Heretickes, and stiled Origenists and Tertullianists; Therefore our judgement must be answerable, it shall not be common.Adhuc ^isericordum adversatur, nihil est infocticius sodicitaeem pecc^^um qua poenais nutrium impunitas and ^ala voluntas velut interior hostis robura^^^. August. op. ^ Men haue medled vvith ceremonies and the externall vvorship of God. The Lord hath given retribution in things externall, if they repent not but goe forvvard against the life and body of Religion: the Lord vvill not spare their liues and bodies, but shall proceed from famine to the svvord, and other more grievous punishments, vvhereby he shall declare that vvith the frovvard he dealeth frovvardly. They vvho vvill not confesse that to be a sinne against God that they haue done, shall be left in his justice to fall into that vvhich shall make them cry, We haue sinned and haue done wrong to the Kirk of God. And vvho are so hardned that they vvil not heare the voice, and feele the finger of Iehovah in his by past vvarnings and present iudgements, shall be stricken vvith a iudgement ere it be long that shall make both their eares to tingle. The Lord hath not left himselfe vvithout a vvitnesse this yeare, vvrath is gone out from him, and the sword of his vengeance is drawn. When the seales were opened, the voice exponed the meaning; afterward the trumpet was sounded for him who would not heare that voice: and for the despiser of the trumpet nothing was prepared but the sti^^^d secret powring out of the viall of judgement. There be m^^^ expounding voyces (blessed be our God) in all the corners of this Nation opening up the meaning of the seales; if we be not wise, the next sound may well be loud, but it shall not be articulate to tell men their particular transgressions procuring wrath; and then judgement shall come without advertisement. Long, long, haue the white colours of peace hung in our eye: The Lord is now displaying his bloudie banner, what remaines if we giue not over but that doolefull ensigne of death without mercie. Blessed are they for ever vvho endure to the end: Blessed are they vvho are marked in the forehead, albeit the marke be not sensible to the vvorld, which seeth not the sealed ones, not can not learne their song: yet it assureth them in the secret off their hearts of the Lords protection, from his devouring Angell.

Although when trangressions are come to the full, the Lord raiseth up men of a fierce countenance, and understanding darke sentences, furnished in a time of defection, with gifts most fitting for destruction: The Lord shall notwithstanding saue his own from their craft and cruelty, so farre as serues for their wished blessednesse, shall poure out of his spirit upon his servants to giue testimony to his glorious truth in the midst of persecution: and shall make them able to discerne betwixt appearance and substance, pretexts and reasons, promises and purposes, successe and conscience, that they goe not blindfolded with the world to perdition.


Archip.
I thanke God I am for my part more able to discerne of them then before, and vvith the spirit of discretion to others. But all this time ye haue said nothing of our covenants, oathes, subscriptions, professions, and the particular bonds of this Kirk obliging us beyond all other people and nations: neither haue yee entered into any particular concerning the fiue Articles.


Epaph.
It was my part to answer your demands: When ye shall urge, and God shall giue opportunity, I shall expound more largely, and apply more particularly the generall verities expressed before. For this time I onely wish ye be as good as your word in the beginning: to follow hardly when ye see truth going before, and to commit the event to the providence of the most high.


Archip.
That is my present resolution, and I hope to die in it. The Lords grace be with you, and with all them that loue the comming of the Lord Iesus Christ, who shall bring an eternall decision upon all the controversies of men.


FINIS.
