by they yea to such a habit of savage tyranny have rebellion bring that nation that nothing have be or still be please to a great part of they but that which all civil kingdom abhor as be their only plague and that be civil war murder and massacre and uproar be to they as music and banquet blood as the most delicate cup of wine thou need not o gallant country to boast that no venomous beast be bread within thou for the heart of thy disobedient child be full of rank poison thou have deserve to be call not one of the daughter of Britannia but to be reject as a bastard and albeit from time to time she have be unto thou as a love nurse and mother thou can not condemn she of unkindness if she prove unto thou a stepdame how many hundred of thousand of our english nation have be drown in their own blood sluc'de out by thy treachery how many of our nobility have lose their life and be confound whilst in their duty and allegiance they go about to induce thou to civility or to chastise thou for thy stubbornness how many widow have bewail the loss of their husband butcher by thy rebellious people how many son and daughter by thy mean have be leave fatherless yet if thou look back o Ireland either upon the fortunate reign of thy late queen and mistress of happy memory or do but number up the day of rest which thy now royal sovereign our most gracious king have in his peaceful and bless government bestow upon thou thou can not choose but confess that thy ill deserve be so many thou have be favourable deal withal in be not punish according to the measure of thy offend thou have be worthy to have be beat with rod of iron for thy unruliness and to have have fire the sword play the executioner upon thou and thy nation for their stiff-necked rebellion but our prince have be unto thou in their correction as father be to child when they punish they yet nothing can win thou to goodness or wean thou from thy bloody and barbarous proceed but let we leave this stream and hoist up sail in that sea where our intent be at first to end our voyage and that be to discover the onset and overthrow of a rebel or rather conductor of rebel sir Carey Adougherty you shall therefore understand that sir Carey adoughertie have with his bloody assotiate fallin Reeah Mack Davy commit that inhuman murder upon sir George Paulet and other the inhabitant of the town of derry think with the that the only buckler to defend villainy be to join the army of more of his sovereign yet do sir Carey adoughertie in the height of his proud overween think that like a whirlwind he shall throw down all that withstand his fury and that like a storm at sea the whole kingdom of Ireland shall veil to he to save itself from shipwreck but God who angel be the guard of prince person and who right hand steer the helm by which kingdom be govern do arm the lord deputy and the council of Ireland not only with present courage to encounter this rebel but with wisdom to prevent and to beat back all storm that by his boisterous and and turbulent spirit be threaten to disquiet the peaceable state of the country one thousand english be therefore forthwith levy and those divide into three regiment under the conduct of these gentleman and other viz. sir Thomas ridgeway treasurer for Ireland sir Richard Wingfield knight Martial of Ireland sir Oliver Lambert sir Richard morrison sir Thomas roper sir Francis Rush sir Toby Cofeild sir josias bodley and beside these diverse gentleman of name all of they use their best policy to cut off the force of the enemy and because they will be sure that he shall not escape out of the net prepare for he those three thousand so divide into three several company be direct to march three several way into the country and by that mean the rebel if he dare come into the field may be encompass and set upon before I proceed any further it shall not be amiss to set down one matter as a argument to express the confidence that sir Cary Adoughertie have in his force as also to show the pride and highness of his spirit and that be thus the bishop of derry and of those part of the country have his wife surprise by sir carry and his accomplice and by they hold prisoner no entreaty of the bishop no nor the ransom of a thousand pound which he offer can buy she out of their hand whereupon the bishop who free pass too and fro aswell to sir Cary as to the english that be his friend without disturbance because he be a churchman enter into speech with the rebel about his unnatural proceed against the peace of his country but Adougherty be careless of his reprehension in the end speak thus I understand quoth he they fight with answerable courage and answerable fortune till at length one of those three company into which the english troop be divide secret keep aloof come upon the sudden and unexpected of the enemy on the back of the rebel so that he be round be set with death and his officer they be like a hear of lusty deer encompass with huntsman and every minute look to hear the knell of their death ring forth yet to show that albeit they scorn life they will not give it away for nothing they fight courageous because they purpose to sell their blood dear but alas what strength of man can hold out when the finger of God be hold up against they God add vigour and knit the sinew of the loyal subject that ho may be of power to confound the traitorous rebel and that their pride may be confound even in that person that first make they faithless to their country and foe to their sovereign heaven open the hand of divine vengeance and from it shoot a bullet which strike sir Carey adoughertie quite through the head the wound be mortal for with it he present fall down and die and so fall down that his hand lie direct under his cheek his head lean upon it and so be find slay about some three hour after he be shoot the head be afterward out off from the shoulder by one of sir Francis rush his man and from the field send to Dublin where to stand fix on a pole over the east-gate of the citey call Newgate in this skirmish be lose on the english side very few of the irish many for the leader be cut off those that be his follower in so dishonest and dishonourable a action faint and feel the deserve instead of the war so that in a short time they be all either slay or as chaff by a furious wind blow away a disperse to nothing since which defeat (@) diverse of the rebel be come in of their own accord and daily more and more do submit themselves to that mercy which sir Arthur chichester the lord deputy have by proclamation offer unto they thus have I set down the overthrow of a man who fortune may have be better have not a turbulent and revenge spirit dwell in his bosom but as the course of his life be bloody so by the just doom of heaven be the conclusion of it God never suffer a hand that take a pride to be imbrue in slaughter to escape unpunished note the end of all such mutinous and barbarous-minded rebel that have burn^ up their country with the fire of civil uproar and have lay waste the hope of the poor hus-bandman and you shall see that their death have be a sudden as bloody know such force as Ireland then have of the king be with some indifferent expedition make ready and commit to the lend of the martial sir Richard Winckfield and sir Oliver Lambert the whole number amount to 600. or there about who pass to the Derrie without hear of the rebel make from thence to Culmore a fort some four mile form it which he have take from captain Harry heart by treachery before which be quit by those that keep it for the rebel before our for (...) sit down before it so that it be get with as much case as lose though more honourable for o doghertie be captain heart gossip have under colour of friendship invite he and his wife to his house as he have often do before and have he there keep he prisoner and swear to his wife unless she will use some mean to deceive the warder and deliver he the castle her husband life shall answer for it which to save she perform the night before the derry be burn this castle our force have again get they march after he to fight with he if he will endure where they understand he be but he have no such purpose quit his own country and go into Mack swine be place of more fastness his wife sister and daughter he have leave in his country in a strong castle of his own whither after his flight our force keep their course and have summon it and receive a answer from the constable thereof they bring a piece of ordinance before it from which the shot be make and a offer of a assault give do so daunt the defendant that they yield both the castle and company in it to the king mercy where the bishop of derry a most valiant and worthy prelate recover his wife so long detain by the rebel and for who ransom he have a few day before proffer 500 pound which be refuse o dogherty lady sister and daughter be a infant be with some other send to the castle of Dublin where they yet remain after this blow give he his kern see their hope perish earnest press he to do something against the king force or there vow to leave he which he undertake to do this be conclude they appoint to set upon our man at the edge of a wood as they shall pass go they to besiege do castle which he hold and there to cut off some of our force but notice be give they find a hot welcome when o dogherty have valour fit a better man think to do something worthy himself and therefore cause his foster father Phelim Reugh to lead a wing of shot and himself come up in the rear which be well perform but in the go off he be something to busy in shake his pike in a vain flourish be by a soldier of sir Francis rush his company note though not for he and shoot through the head Phelim Reuhg see he fall wheel back and bestride the body think to recover it which make the soldier guess he to be a man of special note that be slay and therefore be not so sudden able to charge his piece again he put powder into his pan and make a false proffer which Reugh perceive and fear the like fortune leave the body and flee upon which accident our man advance
