Counseil for Virginia (England and Wales) A declaration of the state of the colonie and affaires in Virginia with the names of the aduenturors, and summes aduentured in that action. By his Maiesties Counseil for Virginia. 22 Iunij. 1620. Counseil for Virginia (England and Wales) Virginia Company of London. By his Maiesties Counseil for VIRGINIA. A Fter the many disasters, wherewith it pleased Al∣mighty God to suffer the great Enemy of all good Actions and his Instru∣ments, to encounter and interrupt, to oppresse and keepe weake, this noble Action for the plan∣ting of Virginia, with Christian Religion, and English people: It hauing pleased him now con∣trarily of his especiall great grace, so to blesse and prosper our late carefull endeauours, as well for the repairing of all former breaches, as for sup∣plying of the present defects, wherewith the Co∣lony was kept downe, that it hath as it were on a sodaine growne to double that height, strength, plenty, and prosperity, which it had in former times attained. We haue thought it now the peculiar duety of our place, accor∣dingly as it hath beene also ordered by a generall Court, to Summon as it were by a kinde of lo∣uing invitement, the whole Body of the Noble and other worthy Aduenturors, as well to the conseruing and perfecting of this happy worke, as to the reaping of the fruit of their great ex∣penses and trauailes. And first to remoue that vnworthy aspersion, wherewith ill disposed mindes, guiding their Actions by corrupt ends, haue both by Letters from thence, and by rumours here at home, sought vniustly to staine and blemish that Coun∣trey, as being barren and vnprofitable; Wee haue thought it necessary for the full satisfacti∣on of all, to make it publikely knowne, that by diligent examination wee haue assuredly found, those Letters and Rumours to haue beene false and malicious; procured by pra∣ctise, and suborned to euill purposes: And con∣trarily disaduowed by the testimony vpon Oath of the chiefe Inhabitants of all the Co∣lony; by whom we are ascertained, that the Countrey is rich, spacious, and well watered; temperate as for the Climate; very healthfull after men are a little accustomed to it; aboun∣ding with all Gods naturall blessings: The Land replenished with the goodliest Woods in the world, and those full of Deere, and other Beasts for sustenance: The Seas and Riuers (whereof many are exceeding faire and nauiga∣ble,) full of excellent Fish, and of all sorts de∣sireable; both Water and Land yeelding Fowle in very great store and variety: In Summe, a Countrey, too good for ill people; and wee hope reserued by the prouidence of God, for such as shall apply themselues faithfully to his seruice, and be a strength and honour to our King and Nation. But touching those Com∣modities for which that Countrey is proper, and which haue beene lately set vp for the Ad∣uenturors benefit: we referre you to a true note of them, lately deliuered in a great and gene∣rall Court, and hereunto annexed for your bet∣ter information. By which and other appro∣ued informations brought vnto vs, Wee rest in great assurance, that this Countrey, as it is sea∣ted neere the midst of the world, betweene the extreamities of heate and cold; So it also par∣ticipateth of the benefits of bothe, and is capa∣ble (being assisted with skill and industry) of the richest commodities of most parts of the Earth. The rich Furres, Cauiary, and Cor∣dage, which we draw from Russia with so great difficulty, are to be had in Virginia, and the parts adioyning, with ease and plenty. The Masts, Planckes, and Boords, the Pitch and Tarre, the Pot-ashes and Sope-ashes, the Hempe and Flax, (being the materials of Linnen,) which now we fetch from Norway, Denmarke, Poland, and Germany, are there to be had in abundance and great perfection. The Iron, which hath so wasted our English Woods, that it selfe in short time must decay together with them, is to be had in Virginia (where wasting of Woods is a benefit) for all good conditions answerable to the best in the world. The Wines, Fruite, and Salt of France▪ and Spaine; The Silkes of Persia and Italie, will be found also in Virginia, and in no kinde of worth inferior. Wee omit here a multitude of other naturall Commodities, dis∣peirsed vp and downe the diuers parts of the world: of Woods, Rootes, and Berries, for ex∣cellent Dyes: Of Plants and other Drugges, for Physicall seruice: Of sweet Woods, Oyles, and Gummes, for pleasure and other vse: Of Cotten-wooll, and Sugar-Canes, all which may there also be had in abundance, with an infinity of other more: And will conclude with these three, Corne, Cattle, and Fish, which are the substance of the foode of man. The Graines of our Countrey doe prosper there very well: Of Wheate they haue great plenty: But their Maze, being the naturall Graine of that Countrey, doth farre exceede in pleasantnesse, strength and fertility. The Cattle which we haue transpor∣ted thither, (being now growne neere to fiue hundred,) become much bigger of Body, then the breed from which they came: The Horses also more beautifull, and fuller of courage. And such is the extraordinary fertility of that Soyle, that the Does of their Deere yeelde two Fawnes at a birth, and sometimes three. The Fishings at Cape Codd, being within those Limits, will in plenty of Fish be equall to those of Newfound Land, and in goodnesse and greatnesse much superiour. To conclude, it is a Countrey, which nothing but ignorance can thinke ill of, and which no man but of a corrupt minde and ill purpose can defame. Now touching the present estate of our Co∣lony in that Country, Wee haue thought it not vnfit thus much briefly to declare. There haue beene sent thither this last yeare, and are now presently in going, twelue hundred per∣sons and vpward, as particularly appeareth in the note aboue specified: and there are neere one thousand more remaining of those that were gone before. The men lately sent, haue beene most of them choise men, borne and bred vp to labour and industry. Out of Deuonshire, about an hundred men, brought vp to Hus∣bandry. Out of Warwickshire and Staffordshire, aboue one hundred and ten; and out of Sussex about forty; all framed to Iron -workes: the rest dispersedly out of diuers Shires of the Realme. There haue beene also sundry persons of good quality, much commended for sufficiency, in∣dustry and honesty, prouided and sent to take charge and gouernment of those people. The care likewise that hath beene taken by directi∣ons, Instructions, Charters, and Commissions to reduce the people and affaires in Virginia in∣to a regular course, hath beene such and so great, that the Colony beginneth now to haue the face and fashion of an orderly State, and such as is likely to grow and prosper. The peo∣ple are all diuided into seuerall Burroughs; each man hauing the shares of Land due to him set out, to hold and enioy to him and his Heires. The publique Lands for the Company here, for the Gouernor there, for the College, and for each particular Burrough, for the Ministers al∣so, and for diuers other necessary Officers, are likewise laid out by order, and bounded. The particular Plantations for diuers priuate Socie∣ties, are setled in their Seates, being alotted to their content, and each in conuenient distance. The rigour of Martiall Law, wherewith before they were gouerned, is reduced within the li∣mits prescribed by his Maiesty: and the lauda∣ble forme of Iustice and gouernment vsed in this Realme, established, and followed as neere as may be. The Gouernour is so restrained to a Counseil ioyned with him, that hee can doe wrong to no man, who may not haue speedy remedy. Each Burrough, and each particular Plantation, partly hath, partly is bound to haue in short time, a sufficient Minister: for whom maintenance is ordained, to each of two hun∣dred pounds a yeere value. Which orderly pro∣ceeding there, by direction from hence, hath caused the Colony now at length to settle them∣selues in a firme resolution to perpetuate the Plantation. They fall to building of Houses, each for his owne priuate; and the Generalitie to the rearing of publique Guest houses, for in∣tertaining of new men vpon their first arriuall. They fall to set vp their Ploughes; to the Plan∣ting of Vineyards; to the pursuing of the Staple Commodities furnished and commended from hence. In summe they are now so full of alacri∣tie and cheerefulnesse, that in a late generall As∣sembly, they haue in the name of the Colony presented their greatest possible thankes to the Company, for the care that hath beene taken for the setling of the Plantation. Neither is it to be omitted, the care which hath beene had here lately at home, for the reducing of all the proceedings and affaires of the Company, to an orderly course of good gouernment and Iustice. Wherein to begin with the fountaine thereof, his Maiesties authority and pleasure, there hath beene a Collection made of all the branches of the same, dispersed in his Letters Patents, now three times renewed: as also out of other In∣structions proceeding from his Maiestie. Out of bothe which, together with such other Orders as (authorised by his Maiestie) the Company themselues haue thought necessary to make, hath beene compiled a Booke of standing Or∣ders and Constitutions, approued by the gene∣rall Consent of all the Company: whereby both the company here, and the Colony in Virginia, haue their businesse carried regularly, industri∣ously, and iustly, euery man knowing both his right and duety, to their generall great content, and the great aduancement of the Action. And whereas the Colony likewise haue beene often Sutors in effect, to reduce into a compendious and orderly forme in writing, the Lawes of Eng∣land proper for the vse of that Plantation, with addition of such other, as the nature of the place, the nouitie of the Colony, and other im∣portant circumstances should necessarily re∣quire: a course is likewise taken for the effect∣ing of this worke; yet so as to submit it first to his Maiesties view and approbation; it being not fit that his Maiesties Subiects should be go∣uerned by any other Lawes, then such as receiue the influence of their life from him. And now to come to that which concerneth the Aduenturors in particular, by whose char∣ges, care, and labour (next vnto his Maiesties especiall grace,) this famous Plantation hath not onely beene vndertaken, but through so many difficulties vpheld and continued: wee should be very greatly iniurious to them, if we should not acquaint them with this seasonable time, for the reaping of that benefit and reward which is due vnto them. Wee therefore let them knowe, that in this last yeare now ended, there haue beene granted by the Company vnder their legall Seale, eleuen seuerall Patents for par∣ticular Plantations; and more are in hand to be passed this next Quarter-Court. It is not vn∣probable, that vpon each of these Patents, di∣uers hundreds of persons will soone Plant in Virginia: there hauing beene already transpor∣ted vpon the first, aboue three hundred men. These and other like Planters, hauing priority of time, will haue priority also in choise of the Seat of their Plantations. Seeing therefore the onely matter of retribution to the Aduenturors, is by a faire proportion of Land to them & their heires; namely of one hundred acres for euery share of twelue pounds and ten shillings, vpon a first di∣uision; and as much more vpon a second, the first being peopled; with fiftie acres for euery person, (to be doubled in like manner) which at their owne charges they shall transport to inha∣bit in Virginia before the 24. day of Iune 1625. if hee continue there three yeares, either at one or seuerall times, or dye after he is shipped for that voyage: It standeth them vpon, who are not willing to be the last in the benefit to be partaked, not to be the least in setting forth to the choise and peopling of their Land. Where∣in what fauour or assistance may by vs be giuen them, they shall be well assured of it, in equall proportion with our selues, as their charges and long expectance haue well deserued. And to the end that not onely the Aduenturors now liuing, but the Heires also of the deceased, may take certaine notice of the seuerall proportions of Land, which ratably to their Aduentures in mony are due and belonging to them: And like∣wise that Posteritie may truely know, by whose charges this Plantation (next vnder his Maie∣stie) hath beene happily founded, maintained, and continued: Wee haue here, according to an Order of Court, set downe in an Alphabe∣ticall Table the names of all the Aduenturors, with all their seuerall sums aduentured. Where∣in if by error, or other mis-accident, there haue wrong beene done to any man; if within one twelue moneth after the date hereof, he giue no∣tice and make proofe thereof to the Companies Auditors; hee shall be set right, and the Table reformed: there being not any thing more deere vnto vs, then to doe Right vnto them with all Iustifiable ▪curtesie, who haue beene beginners and continuers of this glorious worke, tending so much to the propagating of the true seruice of Almighty God, to the ad∣ding of greatnesse and honour to our King, and to the benefit of our whole Nati∣on in disburdening their mul∣titude. 22.

Persons, to set vp three Iron workes; proofe hauing beene made of the extraordinary good∣nesse of that Iron. CORDAGE: for which (besides Hempe) di∣rection is giuen for the planting of Silke∣grasse, (naturally growing in those parts) in great abundance: which is approued to make the best Cordage and Linnen in the world. Of this, euery house-holder is bound to set 100 Plants: and the Gouernour himselfe hath set fiue thousand. POT-ASHES and SOPE-ASHES, PITCH and TARRE: for the making whereof the Polackers are returned to their workes. TIMBER of all sorts, with Masts, Planks and Boords for prouision of Shipping, &c, there being not so good Timber for all vses in any one knowne Countrey whatsoeuer. And for the ease and encrease of diuers of these workes, prouision is sent of men and materials, for the setting vp of sundry Saw∣ing Milles. SILKE: for which that Countrey is excee∣ding proper, hauing innumerable store of Mu bery Trees of the best, and some silke∣wormes naturally found vpon them, pro∣ducing excellent Silke: some whereof is to be seene. For the setting vp of which Commoditie, his Maiesty hath beene gra∣ciously pleased now the second time (the former hauing miscarried) to bestow vp∣on the Company plenty of Silke-wormes seed of his owne store, being the best. VINES: whereof the Countrey yeeldeth naturally great store, and of sundry sorts: which by culture will be brought to excel∣lent perfection. For the effecting whereof, diuers skilfull Vignerons are sent, with store also from hence of Vine plants of the best sort. SALT: which workes hauing been lately suf∣fered to decay, are now ordered to be set vp in so great plenty, as not onely to serue the Colony for the present; but as is hoped in short time also the great Fishings on those Coast. For the following, working, and perfecting of these Commodities, all prouisions necessary for the present are sent in good abundance. As likewise the People that goe, are plenti∣fully furnished with apparell, bedding, victuall for sixe moneths: Implements both for House and abour, Armour, wea∣pons, tooles, and sundry other necessaries. And a supply of Armour, Powder, and ma∣ny necessary prouisions is made for those of the Colonie which were there before; yet without any preiudice to the former Magazin. Gifts. There haue beene giuen to the Colonie this yeere by deuout Persons, these gifts ensuing. Two Persons vnknowne, haue giuen faire Plate, and other rich Ornaments for two Com∣munion Tables; whereof one for the Col∣lege, and the other for the Church of Mi∣strisse Mary Robinsons founding: who in the former yeere by her Will, gaue 200. pounds towards the founding of a Church in Vir∣ginia. Another vnknowne person, (together with a godly letter) hath lately sent to the Trea∣surer 550. pounds in gold, for the bringing vp of children of the Infidels: first in the Knowledge of God and true Religion; and next, in fit Trades whereby honestly to liue. Master Nicolas Ferrar deceased, hath by his Will giuen 300. pounds to the College in Virginia, to be paid, when there shall be ten of the Infidels children placed in it. And in the meane time foure and twenty pounds by yeere, to be distributed vnto three dis∣creet and Godly men in the Colony, which shall honestly bring vp three of the Infidels children in Christian Religion, and some good course to liue by. An vnnamed person sent to the Treasurer the summe of ten pounds, for aduancing of the Plantation. Patents.

To Master Wincopp. To Master Tracie. To Doctor Bohun. To Master Pierce. To Master Delbridge. To Master Pointz. To Master Barkley. To Captaine Bargraue. To Captaine Ward. Who haue vndertaken to transport to Virginia great mul∣titudes of people, with store of Cat∣tell. It is to be knowne, that touching the Col∣lege for the Infidels Children, it hath beene thought more expedient to beginne first with the planting and peopling of the Lands: (which hath beene done this yeere:) and afterwards to proceede to the erecting of the Fabricke, which is to be performed out of the reuenues of the Lands. FINIS. A DECLARATION of the Supplies intended to be sent to VIRGINIA, in this yeare 1620. By his Maiesties Counseil for Virginia. 18. Iulij 1620. W Hereas the Right Honourable, Henry Earle of Southampton, with the aduise and consent of the Counseil and Company for Virginia, hath resolued and con∣cluded to imploy all good meanes in this present yeare, 1620. not onely for the ad∣uancing of the Plantation in strength and multitude of good people, but also for the enriching thereof with store of cattell of diuers sorts, and by setting vp or encreasing such Staple Commodities, as being pro∣per for that Countrey, may be also of most necessary vse for this Realme, and redound in fine to the greatest benefit of both Aduenturors and Planters, and lastly for the establishing there of such good Gouernment (originally deriued from the Kings most excellent Maiestie, the first and chiefe Founder of this glorious worke) as whereby the people there, diuided in soyle onely, but still participating in the religious and hap∣py gouernment of this their natiue Countrey, may continue alwayes as one and the same people with vs, according to the most Princely direction of his Maiestie: We haue thought it very necessarie for the seconding and forwarding of those so noble De∣signes, not onely to publish them to the Aduenturors in generall, thereby to inuite them to concurre with vs in the same, but also to set downe such particulari∣ties requisite, as whereby the preparations of all sorts needfull, may vpon this timely warning, both better and more seasonably be made and compassed. First therefore we haue thought fit, to make it pub∣likely knowne, that besides the great store of particu∣lar Plantations now in prouiding, and like very shortly in large proportion to augment, the Company haue resolued in a late generall Court, by the blessing of God, to set out this yeere at the publike charge, and to send to Virginia, eight hundred choice persons, of the qualities ensuing: First, foure hundred, to be Te∣nants of the general land of the Company, to make vp the number of those Tenants ful 500. wherof 200. to be placed at Elizabeth Citie, with the Companies De∣putie: 100. at Henrico, 100. at Charles Citie: And at Iames Citie there are a hundred and more already. Secondly, one hundred, to be Tenants to such Offi∣cers, &c. as the Court already hath, or shall shortly ap∣point: viz. 10. for the Deputy of the Colledge, 40. for the Companies Deputy, 20. for the Secretary 10. more (besides 50. already sent) for the Ministers: and 20. for the Phisitian: their care for the ease and prosperity of the Colonie, being such and so great, as to cause them to endowe those Offices and places, (as they haue formerly done others,) with faire possessi∣ons, furnished with Tenants and other fit prouisions: that the people may haue the benefit by them, and yet be freed from the burden. Thirdly one hundred yong Maides to make wiues for these Tenants as the for∣mer. 90. which haue been lately sent. Fourthly, one hundred Boyes, to be apprentizes likewise to the publike Tenants. Fiftly, one hundred seruants to be disposed amongst the old Planters, which they greatly desire, and haue offered to defray their charges with very great thankes. And although by reason of the preparations already made, the difficulty may be well conceiued to be in great part ouercome, and the pro∣fit much more neere, and more easie to come by; yet the Companie wholly affecting the peoples prosperity, haue determined to deale both as fauourably in the Contracts, and as bountifully in all sorts of furniture and prouisions with the Tenants which shal now goe, as they haue done with those, which haue beene for∣merly sent. Which conditions it hath beene thought fit here to reinsert and publish. EVery man transported into Virginia, with intent there to inhabit, as Tenants to the Common land of the Company, or to the publike land, shall be freely landed there at the charge of the Company: And shal be furnished with prouisions of victuall for one whole yeare next after his arriuall, as also of Cattle: And with apparell, weapons, tooles and implements, both of house and labour, for his necessary vse. He shall enioy the ratable moytie of all the profits that shall be raised of the land on which he shall be Planted, as well Corne and Cattle, as other commodities whatsoeuer: the o∣ther halfe being due to the Owners of the Land. He shall be tyed by Couenant, to continue vpon that Land for the Terme of seauen yeares: which be∣ing expired, it shal be in his choyse, whither to continue there▪ or to remoue to any other place, at his owne will and pleasure. Of these persons, one hundred and twenty (such as are to be Tenants) are to be shipped here for Vir∣ginia, by the midst of August now at hand: and the rest in Ianuary and February ensuing. The next preparations are of Cattle of diuers sorts: whereof there are intended in the next Spring to be sent these ensuing. One hundred Kine, for this addi∣tion of 500. Tenants. One hundred Kine more, to re∣maine in a perpetuall stock vpon the Companies Land, to be sent to new Planters, as hath bin formerly orde∣red. Foure hundred Goats, twenty Mares, fourescore Asses to be procured from France: The care of pro∣uiding which, is commended to diuers select persons by parts, and the whole to the ouersight of the gene∣rall Committies. The ast prouisions appointed to be made, are for the setting vp, or increasing of diuers principal Com∣modities. For Silke, there is prouision to be made, of great store of Silke-worme-seede about Michaelmas next: as also of men skilfull in the ordering as well of the Wormes, as of their Silke, which are to be sent a∣way in a Pinnace, in October betimes. For Hempe and Flaxe, Pot-ashes and Sope-ashes, Pitch and Tarre, there is a Treaty already on foote, for procuring of men skilfull in those Trades from the Easterne parts: besides the Polakers yet remaining in Virginia. For Wines, it is also ordered, that men skilfull be procu∣red in the planting and dressing of Vines, out of France and from the Rhene: and from thence also and other parts to procure Plants of the best kindes. For Oyle, besides great quantitie to be made out of the Walnuts, growing naturally in Virginia in great a∣bundance, Oliue-Plants are to be prouided from Marseilles and Ligorno. For Fish, which on those Coasts are taken in great plenty, and in worth much better then in New-found-Land, there is care and a course taken, to preserue the Companies Liberties, and to set vp the Fishings in better sort then heretofore. For Salt, order is giuen for the making of it in abun∣dance, and after the manner of those hotter Climates, which may prooue a great helpe to increase the Plan∣tation. For Iron, there is sufficient done alreadie. And for Sawing-Milles, besides those already gone this Spring, there are lately come from Hambo∣rough, diuers Workemen very skilfull, to be sent in the next ship. And that nothing may be wanting for the Companies Tenants, there is a Pinnace already, and other Boates shall be prouided, to remaine there at the Deputies commaund, to traffique and trade for the Company and their Tenants vnder his charge. These large supplies of men, Cattel, and Commodi∣ties, as they tend to the accomplishing of this great worke of the Plantation: so can they not be them∣selues effected, without large prouision of money, be∣ing the sinewes and mouing Instruments in these great Actions. To which end wee desire the noble and worthy Aduenturors, to be assisting to vs, by such meanes as they shall please: especially that the remaine of all promised Aduentures, may in Michaelmas Terme next be paid in without faile, which we trust will now be done cheerefully on all parts, the inuitements of this yeere being well▪considered: that as the presen∣ting of their first payments, hath been the beginning, so the performance of the later, may be the perfecting and finishing of this worke, so glorious before God and man. And here by the way, for the clearing of some scru∣ples and errors through mistaking of our writings lately published, we are to aduertise, that the Alpha∣bet of Aduenturers and summes aduentured, neither then conueniently could, nor was intended to extend any further, then to such summes as haue been paid in to the Treasurors of the Company, and to Sir Baptist Hicks, by speciall order of Court. And whereas diuers other bils of Aduenture, haue bin heretofore deliue∣red, partly vpon personall aduenture, and no money paid in, partly vpon gift from the Company, in regard of deserts, partly for summes paid to other men, whose Accounts hang yet vncleared (and not to the Treasurors) and partly for goods which neuer came within the Treasurors Accounts, but of other inferiour Officers, into whose hands they were deliuered (for which notwithstanding bils of Aduenture haue been deliuered, mentioning as if it were money paid to the Treasuror: If the Aduenturors shall be pleased with∣in the time prefixed, to put in their iust claimes, by these or any other wayes whatsoeuer, there shall be right done to them, and a new alphabeticall booke shall be published, embracing exactly all kinde of Ad∣uenturors, with their seueral summes either really ad∣uentured, or otherwise accepted, allowed or bestowed be it vpon what cause, or in what kinde soeuer. Now if the Auenturors be thus requested with much greater reason are all Accountants to the Com∣pany to be prayed and required, to prepare and make perfect their seuerall Accounts, and to pay in those monyes, which shall remaine due to the Company: that so all parts concurring with their duties and en∣deuours, the worke may proceede with generall ioy. Lastly, as heretofore, so we now also declare, that the persons to be admitted to goe, as the Companies▪ Tenants, and with the foresaid conditions, shall be no other then good men, that is to say of good Trades, of skill in husbandry, or industrious labourers; and such of those as shall be commended for their honest con∣uersation: which persons repairing to the Citie of London in the beginning of August, and in the middle of Ianuary, next, according to the seuerall numbers at those times to be sent, shall from thence-forward be entertained, at the Companies charges, till such time as they be shipped for Virginia: there being especiall care likewise taken, for the prouiding of good Com∣manders and Directors of their workes.

II. EVery Munday before a Quarter-Court, shall be held a Court to prepare all kinde of businesse reser∣ued to the power of the Quarter Court to determine. III. EVery Wednesday fortnight, reckoning from the great Courts, shall also be held an ordinary Court for this Company, for dispatch of ordinary and ex∣traordinary businesse. And it is not to be counted a perfect Court, vnlesse there be fiue of the Counseil there (the Treasuror or Deputie being one) and fifteene of the Generality. IV. IT shall be in the power of the Treasuror, or the Deputie in his absence, vpon extraordinary cause to call an extraordinary Court. V. IT shall not be in the power of any other then a Quarter Court, to make any contract whereby to binde the Company for any continuance of yeares. In which case it shall be proposed also in the Prepara∣tiue Court next preceding. VI. PVblique businesse shall haue the precedence in the Courts before priuate, vnlesse there be extraordi∣nary important cause to the contrary. VII. IF any thing ordered in an ordinary or lesser Court, be afterward reuersed in one of the great and gene∣rall Courts: It shall be from thence forward as though it had neuer beene so ordered. VIII. ALL Courts shall begin at two of the clocke in the afternoone, and dissolue at the rising of the Treasuror, or of the Deputie in his absence. IX. NOthing shall be put to the question after sixe of the Clocke in the after-noone. X. IN regard of the great businesse for Virginia yearely encreasing, It shall be in the power of the Treasuror, (if hee see it so necessary) to assemble the Quarter Courts both in the fore-noones and after-noones of the dayes appointed for them. XI. THe Companie shall be summoned to the Quarter Courts, and Courts extraordinary, by the Offi∣cer: But of the ordinary Courts themselues shall take notice. And the Secretary shall keepe a booke of the proceedings of the Courts: who with the Booke-kee∣per, Husband, and Bedle, shall at all Courts giue di∣ligent attendance. XII. IT shall be lawfull at a generall Court, and with con∣sent thereof, to dispence with all meetings in long Vacations, or in such part of them as may be spared; vnlesse some extraordinary matter befall, in which case may be called extraordinary Courts. XIII. THe Treasuror and Company, being a Body and Commonaltie perpetuall, shall haue one faire and common Seale, to be kept by the Treasuror; and not to be affixed to any Grants or Instruments what∣soeuer, otherwhere then in publique Courts, or by warrant from thence. XIV. THe Treasuror and the Counseil or the Court, haue power to admit any into this Society. Elections. XV. AT the great and generall Court, commonly called the Quarter Court, in Easter Terme, all Offices of this Company (excepting the Counseil) shall be voide: And the Court shall proceede to an election of new Officers, in manner following. XVI. THE Treasuror in the beginning of the Court, at the giuing vp of his Office, shall declare by word or writing the present estate of the Colonie and Planters in Virginia.

AT the choise of each Officer, the persons nomina∣ted for the election, shall withdraw themselues till the party chosen be publiquely so pronounced. And generally no man shall be present in the Court, whilst himselfe or his matter passeth the iudgement of the Court. XIX. IN regard of the weighty and manifold businesse of this Companie, which is also like daily to encrease: No man shall be chosen Treasuror of the Company of Virginia, who at the time of his election is Gouernor of any other Company; but vpon condition that be∣fore the next Quarter Court hee effectually resigne that other Gouernement: except it seeme good for the behalfe of both Companies, that the same man be also Gouernour of the Somer Ilands Company. XX. IT is for weighty reasons thought very expedient, that no man continue in the place of Treasuror or Depu∣tie, aboue three yeares at once. XXI. FOr the auoiding of diuers inconueniences, It is thought fit, that all elections of principall Officers in or for Virginia, as also of the Treasuror and Depu∣tie here, be performed by a Ballating box, as in some other Companies. XXII. EVery Officer as he is chosen, shall openly in Court take his oath: or if he be absent, at the next Court he commeth to. XXIII.
