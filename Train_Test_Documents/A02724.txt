last unto you here be great alteration in this government as I account you have understand before now and because master n. and master f. have be here and hear and see what have pass I do refer the discourse to conference for I assure myself they will visit you yet I will make bold to trouble you to advise of some particular as follow the ten day of May be the battle between muley Sidan and our new king muley Hamet be Abdela not far from marocus betwixt the mountain and the city both side very strong yet in man judgement muley Sidan of most force in horse and foot and three and thirty piece of good field ordnance the other no ordnance and a few peeceman Larbies be the country people dwell in tent breber those that inhabit the mountain azagy be a kind of dart his chief force Larbies of sahara a place distant hence twenty day journey these arm with lance demi lance and azagy and many Larbies that come in to he by the way as he come some he force some voluntary and at the day of battle his people begin to be dismay perceive muley Sidan be very strong but he encourage they say as they have find that come to pass which former he tell they so now they shall see the like and bid they not fear his ordnance for only three piece shall go off and do no harm the rest shall take fire but not shoot a bullet and he will be foremost and go in the face of the ordnance and find his word true then at his command to fall upon his enemy so have satisfy his people with these persuasion send spy to know where muley sydans ordnance lay and so come right before it with all his troop and come within danger at muley sidan command they give fire have both moor and christian that know how to manage his ordnance so three piece go off and do no hurt but the bullet hard sing in the air a great height and the rest of the ordnance take fire and burn out the powder but shoot no bullet that remain in so come near the musketeer play upon they with four thousand shot yet hurt no man so then they come on and muley sidan people give way and flee they pursue they and slay muley Abdela be hammet alkaide hammet Benzebeere and many more alkaide and between four and five thousand people so put his people in to Marocus and lay himself in the field he have not enter into Marocus neither purpose till he have destroy his enemy and put peace in his country so muley Sidan flee and come down to Saphia with Sidan flee and come down to Saphia Hackam be a chief officer in a city with his Hackam Abdela Kather Abdela Sadocke and the jew Benwash and a few other beside his mother and woman and iuggedge hear make account to gather a head again and to give a new battle but in vain the Larbies make a fair show and come in to he and receive some money cloth and linen from he and so will have betray he whereupon he have some of his brother muley Shecks child with he to make friendship with his brother send he his child and write to he very kind so between they I account be peace so stay here so long as he dare for that muley hammet pursue he whereby he be force to freight a ship of Marselle be here in port with a french ambassador who come to he upon business out of France and a Fleming that be in the road and take his treasure and luggage some woman and child some alcaid and servant and Benwash and his follower and go for Santa cruz and there land in Sus and from thence to tarradance and there since remain what force he have or of his proceed we here know not the certainty some few day after his departure come our new king into these part half a day journey from Saphia and all the Larbies come into he and submit themselves and he receive all in to favour pardon what pass for he say he come to make peace and be send from God because of thou evil government of muley hammet son the xeriffe and kindred of Mahomet which they challenge to establish their prophet religion that be decay and to fight against the christian and recover those part of Christendom the king of Spain hold from they as Granada Andaluzia etc. and tell his people they shall yet see great wonder come to pass where they shall acknowledge he be send of God he promise they Spain Italy and France and have put peace in these country there must now appear a bridge in the mouth of the straits which have be in former time and so record in their writing and sink in the sea now in his time it must appear to carry over the moor and have gain these country he must reign forty year and then must come Christ who they call sidie nicer and he must surren all to he for he must judge the world and then all must end but for England Flanders or other part they have not to do they will have friendship with we and desire trade and traffic with we in love and friendship and will have his miracle and act make know abroad the world I be in his Almahalla at first four day and speak or Camp with he and see his behaviour and find he very humble and courteous with many good speech and pity the injury all the christian have by the ill government of his predecessor or usurper as he count they a man of some thirty six year very civil very plain in habit a course tuck upon his head of die calico or turbon a long loose garment much like a irish mantle a Holland shirt a Alheick of lile grogram a plain sword by his side hang with a plain leather thong a man of great wisdom and learning as none like among they and a good ginger a great politician and have draw unto he Alkaide Azus of who you have hear the principal councillor of the land shecke Zimbie shecke Glowie and many other saint and principal man and since his come marry the widow of muley Bufferris and now diverse libel in Larby verse against muley Sidan and his proceed and of further misery must come unto he till he and his race be consume and for his government at Morocco place his Hackam to see every one have peace and a very honest man for justice so Morocco be in peace and quietness and among the Larbies he demand his due either corn horse cattle or money and tell they he come to put peace among they neither to rob they nor yet to lose his right not to give they pay but force they to serve he as need require if they yield not to such condition his sword shall force they he come among they as a guest and be to be entertain by they and not to give they to gain their favour by which speech miracle past and policy he have make they all tremble so he put all to silence some content themselves of the great in former time to hear and see show obedience and say nothing other change with the time and have great employment and profess loyalty to he and renounce their old master what the event may be I know not for we have learn the heart of king be in the hand of the lord he turn they as river of water which way he please but have be in his Almahalla see the manner of it his plainness and policy mix with a show of mercy and a kind of saintish government I fear i it will come to pass according to the fable in Aesop when the frog desire a king a block be throw down into the water which dash at the first make they fear he but lie still they grow familiar and sun themselves upon he and grow in dislike so have the stork but it be to be wish they will now content themselves when peace and justice be offer if he do continue it be like to be with trouble and bloodshed for already the people begin to disobey and the shabenite muley Sidans * * or kindred Cast be get to the mountain near Marocus and have procure some of those * * mountainer Breber as we rearme they to join with they and one muley hammet Bolassad and these have rob to the gate of Marocus whereupon this king send force to expel they but find they so strong that they dare not meddle with they whereupon be force to rehale his Almahalla some fifteen day since and be go towards the mountain where at this present he be near Frugo and what have pass since we know not only expect every hour to hear some good news that he may prevail but here it be great fear because many of his own people be depart from he and those Larbies he carry along with he out of these part run away and return so if he lose the other be the friend of muley Sidan and he be expect again but the beginning and rise of this king and his proceed be very strange he be a great saint and learn in the law and be seek unto by many the princpal of the land for his blessing and favour according to their superstition he find it in ancient book write of he by way of prophecy that such a man of that place name Messae whence he be by name muley Hamet be Abdela shall be send at this time to put peace in the country and to revive their law and put out the race of muley Sidan and name of xeriffe and so to reign forty year till Christ come to judgement his beginning must be he must strike up a drum he shall find in that zowie at and then or saint house shall repair unto he people to make he king the manner of his proceed and what encounter he shall have and what he find write all the talby and learned man now do confess to find the same write in their book at his beginning he put forth only one tent and a kitchen so resort to he the shroky a saintish people in their law but otherwise in behaviour very savage these without pay come to he to the number of 150. or 200. at most and with their help he break alhadge Lemiere and his force servant of muley Sidan be 5000. strong so more of the say shroky come to he to the number of 5000. and with they and such people as join with he in the way he overthrow muley sidan force thrice before the battle and so come to some strong place in the mountain never bring to subjection in the time of muley Sidan nor his father those withstand he but he overcome they and make they pay he what he demand serve and obey he so force the princpal Shecks in the country to come to he after this march towards Morocco and by the way be to pass a river and the day before he warn his people in pass such a river no man to take up water in their hand to drink if he do he will die after come to the river weary and hot many not remember or not regard his word but take up water in their hand drink and anon after die the rest all escape which strike a fear into they to break his command and a persuasion that he be more than a man for they say he be their fatamie that be a saviour next in come to Morocco diverse great saint and shecke resort together and will go to visit he that they may see what he be and understand whether that which pass be true or not so come after salutation he tell they they come to inquire and see what news and what wonder he do and so mean to depart now therefore be man of account and talby he will satisfy they that they may satisfy other so appoint they a time to come again and to bring such book he nominate with they so they do then he will they to turn to such place and read what they find write of he so they do to wit both his name his beginning and course he be to take and withal find write seven special mark or sign he must have upon his body a wart above his right eye a black tooth before a bunch of hair grow between his shoulder a sign of a ring in the palm of his right hand the sign of a spur upon the outside of his right leg the rest I remember not but these and the rest he show they which see they do honour he and swear to he to serve he and to live and die with he or in his cause next come to a place name Dets in the mountain very strong where much people be gather together against he so that some of his own people begin to faint and be afraid he bid they fear nothing for that before to morrow they shall see there be more with he then against he so that night he command to take up his Almahalla and march towards that place Dets so they do and all night long to the think of all his people there march another Almahalla great than they and go before they and come to the place Dets vannish away and at sight of it his enemy flee lest the place and good all to the spoil so come thither have the spoil of all without fight this our country man m. w. affirm with diverse other upon solemn oath to have see at his be in these part myself with other go to welcome he he entertain we very kind and tell we he will show the english what favour he can and permit they free trade will we to take knowledge that he be send by God appointment to relieve the oppress as well Moor and stranger as christian and all sort and what we have see and hear to advertise say we shall see yet more strange matter come to pass than what have pass his meaning as we gather be the conquer of Spain France and Italy with which opinion he possess the foolish and credulous moor now have be tedious to trouble you with such news as the time afford not all but part as it come into my memory I pray you take it in good part the censure hereof I leave to your wisdom and consideration for my own part I be persuade they be delusion of the devil do by witchcraft and permitby the lord to seduce they to further error God deliver we christian well from among they and grant we the use and true knowledge of his holy word preach in christian country which here we want and the use and comfort of his holy sacrament to the seal up of our faith in Christ jesus amen I be sorry I have nothing for remembrance to present unto you but God will when the time better I will not be forgetful in the mean time I pray you accept of these few line in good part so rest ever at your service I commit you to God holy tuition who bless you in this world with health and content and in the world to come with eternal joy amen your love friend to command r. s. an other letter receive from a other friend at the same time date the ten of September good sir pardon i in that at my go away I come not to take my leave of you the ship go down two day soon than I make account off but for all your courtesy always towards i I hearty thank you and remain your debtor etc. for the state of this country and of the war of this new king I know master s. have enlarge you more than I can a great deal but for all this and the trouble muley Sidan have have it be think he will be king again and that in short time stay but for a new moon to give battle this saint or king tell his shroky which come with he at first his come be to take mazagant suit and Tanger not to fight against the moor unless they will resist and not let he take the christian town he say again that muley Sidan and his follower be christian one who rob all man without reason kill and slay many man upon no occasion but in his angry mind and withal say he drink wine and eat therefore say it can not be but that he be a vnsrony which among they they hold to be a unjust or ungodly man as they say we christian be his shroky two thousand five hundred almost all footman with no piece but half lance that be their weapon bareheaded man never in their life they wear shirt or cloth to their back but a Alheik which shroky have leave this king and be all go for their country this king force be of Larbies which be horseman every day they flee from he more and more as alkay side who you know alkay of this place be come from he with six hundred horse so that very short muley Sidan be expect to come hear again and thus with my commendation to your good self and all our good friend I commit you to the almighty you assure to command g. b. since the writing and almost print of these two letter there be news come and that for certain as I be give to understand that muley Sidan be defeat again and have lose this last battle so the saint victorious still what the event of all these trouble may be it be hard to guess this country have be so long time eversince the death of old muley Hamet so unsettle and subject to so manifold alteration so many year almost so many alteration of government the crown imperial toss to and fro from one to another as it be a tennisball rather than a diadem Seneca and that may serve for another use a final use of all either that have pass or may hereafter fall out whereof if any thing else come to my hand worthy observation I shall not withhold it to make the rest answerable to the preface
