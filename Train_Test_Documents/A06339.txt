a report of the kingdom of congo a region of Africa gather by Philippo Pigafetta out of the discourse of m. Edward Lopes a Portugal chap. 1. the journey by sea from Lisbon to the kingdom of congo in the year one thousand five hundred threescore and eighteen dom. 1578. when don Sebastian king of Portugal embark himself for the conquest of the kingdom of Morocco Edward Lopes bear at beneventum a place 24 mile distant from Lisbon near upon the south shore of the river Tagus sail likewise in the month of April towards the haven of Loanda situate in the kingdom of congo in a ship call s. Anthony belong to a uncle of he and charge with diverse merchandise for that kingdom patache 1. a brigandine or a and it be accompany with a patache which be a small vessel whereunto the ship do continual yield good guard and minister great relief conduct and guide the same with light in the night time to the end it shall not lose the way which the ship itself do keep he arrive at the island of madera belong to the king of Portugal the island of madera distant from Lisbon about six hundred mile where he remain 15 day to furnish himself with fresh victual and wine which in great abundance grow in that island yea and in my opinion the best in the world whereof they carry abroad great store into diverse country and especial into England he provide there also sundry other confection and conserve of sugar which in that island be make and wrought both in great quantity and also of singular excellency from this island they depart leave all the canary belong to Castille the canary and take haven at one of the island of Capo Verde call s. Anthony without have any sight thereof before they be come upon it isle of s. Anthony and from thence to another island call saint jacopo isle of s. james which command all the rest and have a bishop and a chaplain in it that rule and govern they and here they provide themselves again of victual I do not think it fit in this place to tell you the number of the canary island which indeed be many nor to make any mention of the island of Capo Verde nor yet to set down the history and discourse of their situation because I make haste to the kingdom of congo and the ship stay here but only for passage and especial for that there do not want good store of report and history which in particularity do make relation of these country only this I will say the island of Capo Verde that these island of Capo Verde be establish by Ptolomee in the table of his geography to be the beginning of the west together with the cape or promontory which he term or the island macarie or blessed which we common call fortunate in these island of Capo Verde the portugal do often arrive and in those country do traffic with sundry merchandise as little ball of diverse colour glass and other such thing wherein those people do great delight and Holland cloth and cap and knife and colour clothes in exchange whereof they bring back again slave wax honey with other kind of food and cotton-cloth of sundry colour moreover right over against they within the land be the country and river of Guynee and of Capo Verde and Sterra leona that be to say the mountain leona which be a huge great mountain and very famous from the foresay island of San jacopo they direct their foredeck towards Bresil for so they must do to gain the wind and take such harbour as be convenient for the season that reign in those place two way from s. jacopo to Loanda to arrive at the end of their voyage two be the way whereby they sail from the isle of San jacopo to Loanda a haven in the kingdom of congo the first way the one be by the coast of Africa the other by the main ocean still enlarge their course with the north wind which very much rule there in those month and for the most part be call north even by the portugal themselves and by the castilian and by the french and by all those people of the north sea and so turn their foreship to the south and southeast they hold on forward till they be near the cape of good-hope leave behind they the kingdom of angola for by that way they must afterwards return and then they come to the altitude of between 27 and 29 degree beyond the equinoctial quite opposite to our pole which south Pole in this writing shall be call the antarctike the antarctik be the south Pole that be to say contrary to the arctike which be our north pole and so the antarctik be opposite thereunto towards the south in that altitude then of the contrary pole the sailor use to meet with certain wind that they call which do blow there almost all our summer and be term by they north-east and northeast in the plural number and by we italian that be to say the wind between the north-east and the east in the spring time which peradventure the venetian in their proper speech do call levantiere that be to say easterly and the greek and latin term they that be to say such wind as every year do ordinary blow in their certain and accustom season and thus sail even to 29 degree of the antarctik with the north wind there fall out a admirable effect for diverse sailor perceive the first general wind when they blow do straight turn their sail about and set their foreship direct on the way to angola and so very oftentimes they fail and be deceive but better it be for he that desire to arrive at his wish haven to go much further and to expect a lusty wind and after to return backward wherein it be to be note for a most memorable accident that the wind do blow very strong from the north even unto 29 degree beyond the equinoctial and then they meet with other wind which be more fierce and furious than they be do drive they back again and this be usual and seasonable there for six month in the year now the ship call s. Anthony hold on his foresay course meet with the say general wind and then turn their prow and their sail by north and by northwest on the right hand towards the kingdom of congo and sail onwards close with the half ship they come in twelve day and twelve night to the island of s. elena not look for the same nor think of it isle of s. elena this island be so call because on the feast day of s. Helen which fall upon the three day of May it be by the portugal first descry and as it be very small so be it as it be singular by itself for be situate in the height of 16 degree towards the antarctike it contain in compass nine mile about and be far distant from the firm land as you sail by sea it may be discover thirty mile of through certain hill and it be a great miracle of nature that in so unmeasurable a ocean be all alone and so little as it be it shall arise as it be out of a most tempestuous and deep sea and yet yield a most safe harbour and most abundant store of relief and victual for ship that be forweary and ready to perish for thirst which come out of the indies the wood of it be very thick and full of ebon tree the commodity of s. elena whereof the mariner do build their boat in the bark of these tree you may see write the name of a infinite number of sailor wood which pass by that island do leave their name cut and carve in the say bark the letter whereof do grow great and great as the body of the tree do wax great in bigness the soil even of itself bring forth very excellent fruit vine tree for there grow the vine which be in deed at the first bring thither by the portugal and especial in the arbour and walk that be about the little church and in the lodging that be there for such as sail thither fruit you shall see there also huge wild wood of orange of citrons of lemon and other such apple tree that all the year long do carry flower and fruit both ripe and unripe and likewise pomegranate great and sweet and of a good indifferent taste with kernel great and red and full of pleasant juice and the stone within they very small and ripe they be at all season of the year as the orange be and fig very great both in quantity and abundance which natural gift and property of be ripe all the year long Homer note to be in diverse fruit of the isle of corfu Odysi h. over all the country they take goat victual and wild kid that be very good to eat and boar and other fourfooted beast and partridge and wild hen and pigeon and other kind of fowl both great and small all which beast and fowl be so secure and so tame that they fear not a man because they do not know in what danger they be to be kill so that the people which dwell there do take of they daily and powder they with salt that be congeal on the bank of the island in certain cave and hole of the rock that be natural make hollow and eat by the wave of the sea and the flesh thereof be thus preserve they give to the sailor that arrive at the island the earth be as it be crommeled like ash the soil of colour red very fat and fruitful beyond measure and so soft as if you tread on it with your foot it will sink like sand and the very tree will shake with the force of a man and therefore it need no labour or tillage for when it reign the fruit do present spring up out of the old seed it bear root of radish as big as a man leg root and herb and very good to eat there grow also colewort and parsley and lettuce and gourd and chiche-person and Faselles and other kind of pulse natural which be ripe do fall into the fruitful ground and multiply of themselves and spring again without any till every ship that come thither bring with it some fruit or garden herb which be plant take root present and bountiful nature yield a courteous reward and usury by reserve the fruit thereof for the sailor when the ship return again there be certain little river in this island Rivers that run in diverse part of it who water be good and wholesome and wherein be sundry safe place for ship to ride in as if they be haven but the principal of they be in a place where they have erect a little church wherein be keep the ornament of the altar and the priest vestiment and other necessary for mass and when ship pass that way the religious person go down unto they to celebrate divine service there be also in the same place a little cottage wherein for the most part some Portugal do remain sometime three sometime two yea and sometime but one alone be leave there either by reason of some infirmity or for some offence commit or else even voluntary because they do desire by this mean to lead the life of a eremite in that wilderness and so to do penance for their sin moreover fish in the same place there be so great abundance of fish as if the sea be very near unto they so that you shall not need but only to cast your hook into the water and you shall present draw they out again load with fish I once demand the question why the island of s. elena be not fortify what reason there be why the portugese do never make any account nor have any care to fortify this island consider it be so fit and necessary for sailor and found there as it be by the providence of God for the relief of the portugese which pass that way as Granata do large discourse upon the creed first write by he in spanish and since translate by myself into italian but answer be make unto i that there be no need so to do for that the island serve to no purpose for the voyage into the indies because there be another way for that passage and it be also a very hard matter to find it out but in return from thence it lie full in the way and be very easy descry so that it will not quit the cost to bestow money and time in maintain soldier therein without any profit see none other vessel come thither but only the portugal and when I reply that the english have now twice enter into those sea this slanderous term use here by this Portugal can impeach the credit of these two honourable gentleman once under the conduct of drake and second this year 1588. under another pirate be also a english man and more valiant than he call Candish who be return home full of great richesse it be answer that yet for all that it can not possible be bring to pass to fortify the same within a sea be so far off and see that all the provision which shall build there must of necessity be bring out of Europe to be short the climate beside all these natural good gift above rehearse the climate be temperate the air pure clean and wholesome and the wind which blow there be very pleasant so that sick person and such as be half dead with the disease of the sea arrive at this island have be present heal and recover their former strength through the benignity of this country from the island of s. Helena the port of Loanda they make sail with the same weather and so within the space of 17 day come to the haven of Loanda which be in the province of congo the wind be somewhat more calm than they be afore this be a very sure and a great haven so call of a island of the same name whereof we shall speak hereafter I tell you before there be two course of sail from the island of Capo Verde to Loanda the one of they be now declare which be never use afterwards be at the first attempt and perform by the same ship wherein signior odoardo go be then guide by Francisco martinez the king pilot a man very great experience in those sea and the first that ever conduct vessel by that way the other be achieve by pass along the coast of the firm land from the island of San jacomo the second course of sail to Loanda the isle of s. Thomas they come to Capo do palmas and from thence direct themselves to the island of San Thomas which lie under the equinoctial so call because it be discover upon that day wherein the feast of that apostle be use to be celebrate it be distant from the firm land 170 mile right against the river call Gaban which be so term because it be in shape very like to that kind of vesture that it be call a Gaban or a cloak the haven thereof be foreclose with a island that raise itself in the channel of the river the haven of s. Thomas whereunto the Portugal do sail with small bark from s. Thomas island carry thither such thing as usual they carry to the coast of Guinea and from thence carry back with they ivory wax and honey oil of palm and blackmore slave near to the island of s. Thomas towards the the north lie another island call the isle of the prince the isle of the prince distant from the firm land a hundred and five mile be of the same condition and traffic that the isle of s. Thomas be although in circuit somewhat less this island of s. Thomas be in fashion almost round the isle of s. Thomas great traffic and in breadth contain 60 mile and in compass Clxxx. very rich it be and of great traffic discover at the first and conquer by the Portugal at such time as they begin the conquest of the indies it have diverse haven but the principal and chief of all whereinto the vessel arrive there do withdraw themselves be in the place where the city stand the island breed a infinite deal of sugar and almost all kind of victual sugar church a castle in the city there be some church and a bishop with many clerk and one chaplain or priest there be also a castle with a garrison and artillery in it which beat upon the haven be a very great and a safe port where many ship may ride but a very strange and admirable thing it be that when the portugal do first come thither there be no sugar there plant but they bring it thither from other country ginger as they do ginger also which take root and grow there in most abundant manner the soil in deed be moist and as it be appropriate to foster the sugar cane which without any other water multiply of itself and fructify infinite the reason whereof be because the dew fall there like rain and moisten the earth there be in this island above 70 house or press for make of sugar 70. house to make sugar in and every press have many cottage about it as though it be a village and there may be about some three hundred person that be appoint for that kind of work they do every year load about forty great ship with sugar true it be indeed that not long ago the worm as it be a plague to that land have devour the root of the cane and destroy the fruit of their sugar in such sort as now of the forty ship they do not load above five or six vessel with that merchandise and thereupon it come that sugar be grow so dear in those country the island of s. Thomas hold traffic with the people that dwell in the firm land which do usual resort to the mouth or entry of their river the first whereof to begin withal be name the river of Fernando Poo the river and island of Fernando Poo that be to say of Fernando powder who do first discover the same and lie in five degree towards our Pole right against the mouth of it rise a island of the same name r bora. Campo lie thirty and six mile distant from it the second river be call Bora that be to say r. di san. benedetto filth the three la Campo the four di San benedetto and the five that of Angra which in the mouth of it have a island call di corisco r di Angra the isle of corisco that be to say thunder all these do traffic the same merchandise which we mention before but to return to the voyage of s. Thomas the cape of Lupo Gonzale depart from thence towards the south we find the cape of Lupo Gonzale which stand in the altitude of one degree beyond the equinoctial towards the pole antarctike a hundred and five mile distant from the foresay isle and from thence they sail with land wind creep still all along the coast and every day cast in some safe place either behind some point or else in some haven until they come to the mouth of the great river in congo call in their tongue Zaire Zaire the great river of congo which signify in latin in english I know from whence if you will go through to the haven of Loanda you must sail the length of a hundred and fourscore mile these be the two voyage by sea that be use from the island of San jacomo which be one of those island that before we tell you be the island of Capo Verde and be but a little while ago first begin to be frequent and now it be time to entreat of the kingdom of congo and all the condition thereof chap. 2. of the temperature of the air of the kingdom of congo and whether it be very cold or hot whether the man be white or black whether be more or less black they that dwell in the hill or those that dwell in the plain of the wind and the rein and the snow in those quarter and of what stature and semblance the man of that country be the kingdom of congo in the middle part thereof the situation of congo be distant from the equinoctial towards the pole antarctike just where the city call congo do lie seven degree and two three so that it stand under the region which ancient writer think to be unhabitable and call it that be to say a cincture or girdle of the earth which be burn by the heat of the sun wherein they be altogether deceive the temperature of the kingdom for the habitation there be exceed good the air beyond all credit temperate the winter nothing so rough but be rather like autumn in this region of Rome the people use no fur nor change of apparel they come not near the fire neither be the cold in the top of the mountain great than that which be in the plain but general in winter time the air be more hot than it be in summer by reason of their continual rain and especial about two hour before and after noon so that it can hardly be endure the man be black the complexion of the people and so be the woman and some of they also somewhat incline to the colour of the wild olive their hair be black and curl and some also red the stature of the man be of a indifferent bigness and except their blackness they be very like to the Portugal the apple of their eye be of diverse colour black and of the colour of the sea their lip be not thick as the nubian and other negro be and so likewise their countenance be some fat some lean and some between both as in our country there be and not as the negro of Nubia and Guinea which be very deform small difference between their day and night their night and their day do not great differ for in all the whole year you shall not discern the difference between they to be more than a quarter of a hour the winter in this country to speak at large begin at the same time their winter and summer that our spring here begin that be to say when the sun enter into the northern sign in the month of March. and at the same time that we have our winter when the sun enter into the southern sign in the month of September then begin their summer in their winter it rain 5. month almost continual that be to say in April May June July and August of fair day they have but a few because the rain fall so great and the drop of it be so big as it be a wonder to see these water do marvelous supple the ground which be then very dry by reason of the heat of the summer past wherein it never rain for the space of six month together and after the ground be full and as it be ingorge with water then do the river swell beyond all credit and be so replenish with trouble water that all the country be surround by they the wind which blow in these moon through all this region the wind in this country in winter time be the very self same that Cesar call by a greek word etesij that be to say ordinary every year whereby be mean those wind that in the cearde be note from the north to the west and from the north to the north-east these wind do drive the cloud to the huge and high mountain whereupon they rush with very great violence and be there stay of their own nature they be afterwards melt into water so that when it be likely to rain you shall see the cloud stand as it be upon the top of their high hill and hence arise the increase and augmentation of the river that spring in Aethiopia the cause of the increase of Nilus and other river in Ethiopia and especial of Nilus and other that discharge themselves into the east and west ocean and in the kingdom of congo and Guinea through which run the river Nigir so call by the ancient writer and by the new term Senega the river Nigir or Senega run westward you shall see the say river increase at the very self same time that Nilus do but in deed carry his water towards the west direct against the island of Capo Verde Nilus run northward whereas Nilus run by the isle of Meroe in Egypt towards the north refresh and water all those region that be full of scorch heat and wilderness and desert now for as much as in the region of congo and Aethiopia it be always wont to rain every year at a certain set time the swell and overflow of the river there be of no great consideration nor any strange accident to make account of but in the country it never rain in Egypt but only in Alexandria that be far distant and very dry as in Egypt where it never rain save only in Alexandria and the territory thereof it be account a marvelous matter to see every year so great a quantity of thick trouble water come upon they from place so remote at a certain set time without miss which water do quicken the ground and minister food both to man and beast and thereupon the ancient do sacrifice to that river call it (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) the good God as Ptolemy note in his four book yea and some of our christian at this day do hold it for a miracle so that without these water they shall perish for hunger because their life do depend upon this increase of the water as s. Chrysostome say thus these wind call by Cesar etesij and by the portugal do blow with we in summer but with they in winter and carry the cloud unto the top of those huge mountain which make they to melt into rain and so it fall out that by reason of these rein their winter as it be aforesaid be nothing so cold because the water do engender a certain kind of warmth in those hot region this be then the cause of the increase of Nilus and other river in that climate whereof the ancient of old time make so great doubt and invent so many fable and error but in their summer which be our winter there blow other wind that be quite opposite to the former their wind in summer time even in and be note in the card from the south to the southeast which out of all question must needs be cold because they breath from the contrary pole antarctike and cool all those country even for all the world as our wind in summer do cool our country and whereas there with they these wind do make the air very fair and clear so do they never come unto we but they bring with they great store of rain and this come to pass by a certain natural disposition of the earth which be govern by the heaven and the climate thereof and by the sovereign providence of God who have part the heaven and the course of the sun and of the other planet in such sort that every country upon the face of the earth do enjoy the virtue of their light both in heat and in cold and also in all other season of the year by a most singular measure and proportion and certain if the breath of these wind do not refresh and cool these country of Aethiopia and congo and other place near about they it be not possible for they to endure the heat consider that even in the night time they be constrain to hang two cover over they to keep away the heat the same cool and refresh by wind be common also to the inhabitant of the isle of Candie and of the island in Arcipelago and of Cyprus and of Asia the less and of Soria and of Egypt which do live as it be with this refresh of the foresay wind of the northwest and of the west so that they may well be call as they be in greek (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) no snow nor ice in Ethiopia or congo breeder of life let it be also remember that in the mountain of Aethiopia and of congo and the region near adjoin there fall no snow neither be there any at all in the very top of they save only towards the cape of good-hope and certain other hill which the portugal call Sierra nevada that be to say the snowy mountain neither be there any ice or snow to be find in all the country of congo which will be better esteem there then gold to mingle with their drink so that the river there do not swell and increase by melt of snow but because the rain do fall out of the cloud for five whole moon continual together that be to lay in April May june july and August the first rain sometime begin on the 15 day and sometime after and this be the cause why the new water of Nilus which be so great desire and expect by the inhabitant there do arrive soon or late in Egypt chap. 3. whether the child which be beget by portugal be of a white skin and bear in those country by the woman of congo be black or white or tawny like a wild olive who the portugal call Mulati all the ancient writer have certain believe the true cause of white and black in the body of the inhabitant of these country that the cause of black colour in man be from the heat of the Sun for by experience it be find that the near we approach to the country of the south the brown and black be the inhabitant therein and contrariwise the far you go towards the north the white shall you find the man as the french and the dutch and the english and other notwithstanding it be as certain a thing as may be that under the equinoctial there be people which be bear almost all white as in the kingdom of Melinde and Mombaza situate under the equinoctial and in the isle of San Thomas which lie also under the same climate and be at the first inhabit by the Portugal though afterwards it be disinhabit and for the space of a hundred year and upward their child be continual white yea and every day still become white and white and so likewise the child of the portugese which be bear of the woman of congo do incline somewhat towards white so that signior odoardo be of opinion that the black colour do not spring from the heat of the sun but from the nature of the seed be induce thereunto by the reason above mention and sure this his opinion be confirm by the testimony of Ptolemy who in his description of the innermost part of Lybia make mention of white ethiopian which he call in his language (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) that be to say white moor and in another place also of white elephant which be in the same country chap. 4. of the circuit of the kingdom of congo and of the border and confine thereof and first of the western coast the kingdom of congo be distinguish by four border the first of the west which be water with the ocean sea the second of the north the three of the east and the last which be towards the south and to begin with the border lie upon the sea the first part of it be in the bay the western border of congo the bay of cow call Seno and be situate in the height of 13. degree upon the antarctik side and stretch all along the coast unto 4. degree and a half on the north side near to the equinoctial which space contain 630. mile this Seno be a haven but of a moderate bigness and yet a good one and able to receive any ship that arrive it be call Seno that be to say the bay of cow because thereabouts there be pasture very many herd of that kind of cattle the country be plain and abound with all manner of victual and there you shall find some kind of mettle to be public sell especial silver and it be subject to the king of angola a little more forward lie the river the river where a certain lord be subject to the king of angola do special command and about the say river be a great compass of country much like to the former and a little further run the river Songa the r. son so call by the Portugal wherein you may sail 25. mile upward in a country also like to the former the follow the river Coanza which issue out of a little lake the r. Coanza feed by a certain river that flow out of a great lake be the chief and principal spring or head of Nilus whereof in the other part of this discourse we shall have occasion to write Coanza at the mouth of it be two mile broad and you may sail with small bark upward against the stream about 100 mile but have no haven and here it be to be note that all this country which we have here describe be wont to be subject to the king of congo but a while ago the governor of that country be become the absolute lord thereof and profess himself to be a friend to the king of congo but not his vassal and yet sometime he send the king some present in manner of a tribute beyond the river Coanza be the haven of Loanda be in ten degree make as it be say by a certain island call Loanda the island of Loanda which signify in that language bald or Shave because it be a country without any hill and very low for indeed it scarce raise itself above the sea this island be frame of the sand and dirt of the sea and of the river Coanza who wave meet together and the filthy matter sink down there to the bottom in a continuance of time it grow to be a island it may be about 20. mile long and one mile broad at the most and in some place but only a bowshoote but it be a marvelous thing that in such a sandy ground if you shall dig to the depth of two or three hand-breadths you shall find sweet water the best in all those country wherein also there be a very strange effect that when the ocean ebb this water become somewhat salt but when it flow to the top it be most sweet a thing that fall out also in the island of in Spain by the report and testimony of Strabo this island be the mine of all the money which the king of congo spend the money of congo and all the people thereabouts for upon the shore you shall have certain woman that use to dive and duck into the sea two yard deep and more and fill their basket with sand and afterwards divide the gravel from certain small shellfish that be among it which be call Lumache and when these Lumache be sever by themselves then do they pick out the male from the female which they may easy do because the female be more fine than the male and great esteem for her colour which be very neat bright and pleasant to the sight these Lumache do breed in all the shore of the kingdom of congo but the best of all be those of Loanda the lumache of Loanda because they look very fine and of a very bright colour some gray or ashecoloured and some of other colour not so precious and here you must note that gold and silver and mettle be not of any estimation nor in use of money in these country but only these lumache so that neither with gold nor silver in mass or in coin you shall buy any thing there but with these lumache you shall buy both gold and silver or any thing else in this island there be 7. or 8. town call in that country language the principal whereof be Spirito Spirito santo and therein dwell the governor which be send from congo to minister justice and to gather the treasure of the money of these Lumache here be also goat and sheep and boar in great number which be tame at the first do afterwards become wild and live in the wood here grow also a tree call Enzanda which be a great one and always green the tree Euzanda and endue with a singular quality for from the bow of it that sprout upward there hang down certain thread as it be which creep into the earth do take root and out from these root do rise other tree and so they multiply and within the outmost bark thereof there grow a certain kind of peel like fine linen which be beat and cleanse they spread out in length and in breadth and therewith they clothe their man and woman that be of the base sort in this island they have certain vessel make of the body of palm-tree their boates. join together and frame after the manner of our boat with a prow and a stern wherein they pass from place to place both with oar and sail in these boat they use to fish about the river which be indeed exceed full of fish and sometime also they will go over to the firm land in that part of this island which be towards the main land in certain low place there grow certain tree which when the water of the ocean ebb discover themselves and at the foot thereof you shall find certain other shellfish cleave as fast to the tree as may be shellfish have within they a great fish as big as a man hand and very good meat the people of the country know they very well and call they that be to say the fish of the rock the shell of these fish they use to burn and thereof make very good lime to build withal and be like the cork or bark of the tree which be call Manghi they dress their ox hide withal to make their shoe sole the strong to be brief this island bring forth neither corn nor wine what kind of money be use in sundry country but there be great store of victual bring thither from all part thereabouts to fetch away these Lumache for as in all other place all thing may be have for money of mettle so all thing here be have for Lumache whereby may be note that not only here in this kingdom of congo but also in her neighbour Ethiopia and in Africa and in the kingdom of China and certain other of the indies they use money of other matter then of mettle that be to say neither gold nor silver nor copper nor any other mixture temper of these for in Aethiopia their money be pepper and in the kingdom of Tombutto which be about the river Nigir otherwise call Senega their money be cockle or shellfish and among the Azanaghi their money be Porcellette and in the kingdom of Bengala likewise they use Porcellette and mettle together in China they have certain shellfish call also Porcellette which they use for their money and in other place paper stamp with the king seal and the bark of the tree call Gelsomora whereby it appear that the money which be pay for every thing be not mettle all the world over as it be in Europe and in many and sundry other country of the earth this island in the straight part of it be very near to the firm land and the people do oftentimes swim over the channel there in this strait there arise out of the ocean certain Islettes certain Islettes which show themselves forth from the water when it ebb and be cover again when it flow and in those islet you shall see great tree and most excellent shellfish cleave fast to the body of they such as I tell you of before near to this island towards the outward coast to the sea great store of whale there swim a innumerable sort of whale that look black and fight one with another do kill themselves which afterwards be by the wave cast up upon the shore as big as a middling merchant ship the negro go forth with their boat to fetch they and to take the oil out of they which be mingle with pitch they use to trim their vessel withal upon the ridge or back of these creature there grow many shellfish make like snail cockle and whelk whereof signior odoardo affirm that he have see great store he be also of opinion that amber come not from these fish for over all the coast of congo where there be a infinite number of they amber come not from the whale you shall not find either Ambregriz or any other amber black or white in any place and yet if it shall come from these creature there must have be of necessity great store of it find upon these Sh the principal haven of this island have his entrance towards the north the haven of Loanda and on that side it be half a mile broad and of a very great depth upon the firm land direct over against the island be a town call villa di San Paulo Villa San Paulo altogether inhabit with Portugal and their wife which they bring with they out of Spain and yet it be not fortify all this channel be very full of fish especial of sardina store of fish and of anchiove whereof there be so great store that in the winter time they will of themselves leap up to land other kind of most excellent fish there be as

dart they carry also certain dagger which be in shape much like to the head of their dart beyond the kingdom of Loango be the people call anzigue the country of Anzicos of who we shall deliver unto you a history which in truth be very strange and almost incredible for the beastly and cruel custom that they use in eat man flesh yea and that of the near kinsfolk they have this country towards the sea on the west border upon the people of Ambus and towards the north upon other nation of Africa and the wilderness of Nubia and towards the east upon the second great lake from whence the river of congo spring in that part which be call Anzicana and from the kingdom of congo it be divide by the river Zaire wherein there be many island as before be tell you scatter from the lake downwards and

french pock and so heal the french pock which they call in that language Chitangas some do affirm that this gray sanders be the very that grow in India and signior odoardo affirm that the portugese have prove it for the head ache for the headache by lay it on the coal and take the smoke of it the pith and innermost part of the tree be the best but the utter part be of no estimation they make great store of linen of the palm tree both of sundry sort and colour and much cloth of silk whereof we will discourse more hereafter the people be subject to a king that have other prince under he they be very active and warlike their bow they be ready to take arm and do fight on foot their weapon be different from the weapon of all other people round about they for their bow be small and short make of wood and wrap about with serpent skin of diverse colour and so smooth wrought that you will think they to be all one with the wood and this they do both to make the bow strong and also to hold it the fast their string be of little wooden twig like reed not hollow within but sound and pliable and very dainty such as the cavaliero of Portugal do carry in their hand to beat their palfrey withal they be of a ash colour and of a lion tawny somewhat tend to black they grow in the country of the anzigue and also in the kingdom of Bengala their arrow through which the river Ganges run their arrow be short and slender and of a very hard wood and they carry they on their bow hand they be so quick in shoot that hold 28 shaft or more in their bow-hand they will shoot and discharge they all before the first arrow light on the ground yea and sometime there have be see diverse stout archer that have kill bird as they fly in the air other weapon also they make as axe and hatchet their weapon which they use and frame after a strange manner for the handle be short by the half than the iron be and at the low end of it there be a pommel for the fast hold of it in the hand and all cover over with the foresay skin of a serpent in the uppermost end of it be the iron very bright and shine fasten to the wood with plate of copper in the manner of two nail as long as the handle it have two edge the one cut like a hatchet and make a wound after the fashion of a half roundel the other be a hammer when they fight with their enemy or defend themselves from their arrow they be so exercise with a wonderful speed and nimbleness to manage their weapon that whirl they round about as it be in a circle they keep all that compass of the air which be before they so that when the enemy shoot and the arrow begin to fall it light upon the hatchet be so swift and vehement whirl about that it break the force of the arrow and so it be repulse then do they hang the hatchet upon their shoulder and begin to shoot themselves they have also certain short dagger with sheathes of the serpent skin make like knife with a haft unto they which they use to wear a cross their girdle be of diverse sort but the man of war have their girdle of elephant skin 3. good finger broad and because they be at the first 2. finger thick and very hard to handle handsome by the heat of the fire they bow they round and so with certain button tie they overthwart about they the man be very active and nimble the nature of the and leap up and down the mountain like goat courageous they be and contemn death man of great simplicity loyalty and fidelity and such as the Portugal do trust more than any other in so much as signior odoardo be wont to say that if these Anzichi will become christian be of so great fidelity sincerity loyalty and simplicity that they will offer themselves to death for the glory of the world and to please their lord will not stick to give their own flesh to be devour then will they with a far better heart and courage endure martyrdom for the name of our redeemer jesus Christ and will most honourable maintain our faith and religion with their good testimony and example against the gentile moreover their merchandise the say signior odoardo do likewise affirm that there be no converse with they because they be a savage and a beastly people save only in respect that they come and traffic in congo bring thither with they slave both of their own nation and also out of Nubia whereupon they do border and linnencloth whereof we will tell you hereafter and elephant tooth in exchange of which chaffer they recarry home with they salt and these Lumache which they use in steed of their money and coin and another great kind of Lamache which come from the isle of s. Thomas and which they use to wear for brooch to make themselves fine and gallant withal other merchandise also they carry back with they which be bring out of Portugal as silk and linen and glass and such like they use to circumcise themselves and another foolish custom they have both man and woman as well of the nobility the Anzichi be circumcise and mark in their face as of the commonalty even from their childhood to mark their face with sundry slash make with a knife as in due place shall be further show unto you they keep a shambles of man flesh as they do in these country for beef and other victual a shambles of man flesh for their enemy who they take in the war they eat and also their slave if they can have a good market for they they sell or if they can than they deliver they to the butcher to be cut in piece and so sell to be roast or boil and that which be a marvelous history to report some of they be weary of their life and some of they even for valour of courage and to show themselves stout and venturous think it to be a great honour unto they if they run into voluntary death thereby to show that they have a special contempt of this life will offer themselves to the butchery as faithful subject to their prince for who sake that they may seem desirous to do they notable service they do not only deliver themselves to be devour by they but also their slave when they be fat and well feed they do kill and eat they true it be that many nation there be that feed upon man flesh as in the east indies and in bresil and in other place but that be only the flesh of their adversary and enemy a strange beastly custom but to eat the flesh of their own friend and subject and kinsfolk it be without all example in any place of the world save only in this nation of the Anzichi the ordinary apparel of these people be thus their apparel the common sort go naked from the girdle upward and without any thing upon their head have their hair truss up and curl the noble man be apparel in silk and other cloth and wear upon their head blue and red and black colour and hat and hood of Portugal velvet and other kind of cap usual in that country and indeed they be all desirous to have their apparel handsome and neat as their ability will suffer they the woman be all cover from top to toe after the common manner of Africa the poor sort of they do gird themselves close from the girdle downward the noble woman and such as be of wealth do wear certain mantle which they cast over their head but keep their face open and at liberty and shoe they have on their foot but the poor go barefoot they go very quick and lightsome their stature be comely and their condition fair and commendable their language be altogether different from the language of congo their language and yet the Anzichi will learn the language of congo very soon and easy because it be the plain tongue but the people of congo do very hardly learn the language of the Anzichi and when I once demand what their religion be it be tell i they be gentile and that be all that I can learn of they chap. 6. of the east coast of the kingdom of congo and the confine thereof the east coast of the kingdom of congo begin as we have tell you at the meeting of the river Vumba the eastern border of congo and the river of Zaire and so with a line draw towards the south in equal distance from the river Nilus which lie on the left hand it take up a great mountain which be very high and not inhabit in the top thereof call the mountain of crystal the mountain of crystal because there be in it great quantity of crystal both of the mountain and of the cliff and of all sort and then pass on further include the hill that be call Sierras the mountain of the sun that be to say the hill of the sun because they be exceed high and yet it never snow upon they neither do they bear any thing but be very bare and without any tree at all on the left hand there arise other hill call the hill of sal-nitrum the mountain of sal-nitrum because there be in they great store of that mineral and so cut over the river Berbela that come out of the first lake there end the ancient bind of the kingdom of congo on the east thus than the east coast of this kingdom be derive from the meeting of the two foresay river Vumba and Zaire until you come to the lake and to the country of Malemba contain the space of six hundred mile from this line which be draw in the eastern coast of congo to the river Nilus and to the two lake whereof mention shall be make in convenient place there be the space of 150. mile of ground well inhabit and good store of hill which do yield sundry metal with much linen and cloth of the palm tree and see we be now come to this point of this discourse the art of make silk in this eastern coast. it will be very necessary to declare unto you the marvelous art which the people of this country and other place thereabouts do use in make clothes of sundry sort as velvet shear and unshorn cloth of tinue satin taffeta damask sarcenet and such like not of any silken stuff for they have no knowledge of the silkworm at all although some of their apparel be make of silk that be bring thither from our country but they weave their clothes aforenamed of the leaf of palm tree which tree they always keep under and low to the ground every year cut they and water they to the end they may grow small and tender against the new spring out of these leaf be cleanse and purge after their manner they draw forth their thread which be all very fine and dainty and all of one evenness save that those which be long be best esteem for of those they weave their great piece these stuff they work of diverse fashion as some with a nap upon they like velvet on both side and other cloth call damask branch with leaf and such other thing and the which be call high and low and be far more precious than we be this kind of cloth no man may wear but the king and such as it please he the great piece be of these for they contain in length four and five span and in breadth three and four span and be call Incorimbas by the name of the country where it grow which be about the river Vumba the velvet be call Enzachas of the same bigness and the damask and the Maricas and the Zendadi and the of the light sort of these stuff they have great piece which be wrought by the Anzichi and be six span long and five span broad wherewith every man may apparel himself according to his ability beside that they be very thick and sound to keep out the water and yet very light to wear the Portugal have late begin to use they for tent and booth which do marvelous resist both water and wind chap. 7. of the confine of the kingdom of congo towards the south this eastern coast as it be before set down end in the mountain call the southern coast. that be the mountain of silver the mountain of silver and there begin the four and last border of the kingdom of congo towards the south that be to say from the foresay mountain to the bay of cow on the west contain in length the space of four hundred and fifty mile and this southern line do part the kingdom of angola in the middle and leave on the left hand of it the foresay mountain of silver and further beyond they towards the south the kingdom of Matama which be a great kingdom very mighty and absolute of itself and sometime in amity and sometime at utter enmity with the kingdom of angola the king of Matama be in religion a gentile the k. of Matama and his kingdom stretch towards the south to the river Bravagal and near to the mountain common call the mountain of the moon and towards the east border on the western bank of the river Bagamidri and so cross over the river Coari this country abound in vault of crystal and other metal and all manner of victual and good air and although the people thereof and their neighbour borderer do traffic together yet the king of Matama and the king of angola do oftentimes war one against the other as we tell you before and this river Bagamidri divide the kingdom of Matapa from the kingdom of Monomata which be towards the east and whereof John de Barros do most large discourse in the first chapter of his ten book towards the sea coast there be diverse lord that take upon they the title of king but indeed they be of very base and slender estate neither be there any port or haven of any account or name in the river there and now forasmuch as we have oftentimes make mention of the kingdom of angola the k. of angola this will be a very convenient place for we to entreat thereof because it have be heretofore say that the king of angola be in time pass but a governor or deputy under the king of congo although since that time he be become a good christian yet have he make himself a free and a absolute prince and usurp all that quarter to his own jurisdiction which before he have in regiment and government under another and so afterward in time conquer other country thereabouts insomuch as he be now grow to be a great prince and a rich and in power little inferior to the king of congo himself and therefore either pay tribute or refuse to pay tribute unto he even at his own good pleasure it come to pass John the second k. of Portugal first bring christianity into congo that don Giovanni the second be king of Portugal plant the Christian religion in the kingdom of congo and thereupon the king of congo become a christian. after which time the lord of angola be always in amity and as it be a vassal of the forename king of congo and the people of both country do traffic together one with another and the lord of angola do every year send some present to the king of congo and by licence from the king of congo there be a great trade between the Portugal and the people of angola at the haven of Loanda where they buy slave and change they for other merchandise and so transport all into the isle of saint Thomas whereby it come to pass that the traffic be here unite with the traffic of s. Thomas so that the ship do use first to arrive at that island and then afterward pass over to Loanda and when this trade begin in process of time to increase they dispatch their ship from Lisbon to angola of themselves and send with they a governor call Paulo diaz of Novais Paulo diaz the first discoverer of this traffic to who this business do as it be of right appertain in regard of the good desert of his ancestor who first discover this traffic to this Paulo diaz do don Sebastiano king of Portugal grant leave and authority to conquer don sebastian k. of Portugal for the space of 33 league upward along the coast begin at the river Coanza towards the south and within the land also whatsoever he can get towards all his charge for he and his heir with he there go many other ship that open and find out a great trade with angola which notwithstanding be direct to the foresay haven of Loanda where the say ship do still discharge themselves and so by little and little he enter into the firm land Paulo diaz build a house in Anzelle and make himself a house in a certain village call Anzelle within a mile near to the river Coanza because it be the more commodious and nigh to the traffic of angola when the trade here begin thus to increase and merchandise be free carry by the Portugese and the people of congo to Cabazo a place belong to the lord of angola the author call he lord because he be then but a petty king and distant from the sea 150. mile there to sell and barter they it please his lordship to give out order that all the merchant shall be slay and their good confiscate allege for his defence that they be come thither as spy and to take possession of his estate but in truth it be think that he do it only to gain all that wealth to himself consider that it be a people that do not deal in the habit of warrior but after the manner of merchant and this fall out in the same year that the king don Sebastiano be discomfit in Barbary when Paulo diaz understand of this course he put himself in arm against the king of angola Paulo diaz in arm against the k. of angola and with such a troop of portugese as he can gather together that be to be find in that country and with two galley and other vessel which he keep in the river Coanza he go forward on both side of the river conquer and by force subdue many lord and make they his friend and subject but the king of angola perceive that his vassal have yield to the obedience of Paulo diaz and that with all prosperous success he have gain much land upon he he assemble a great army to go against he and so utter to destroy he p. diaz demand succour of the k. of congo whereupon Paulo diaz request the king of congo that he will succour he with some help to defend himself withal who present send unto he for aid a army of 60 thousand man under the conduct of his cousin don Sebastiano Manibamba and another captain with 120. Portugal soldier that be in those country and all of his own pay for the achieve of this enterprise this army be to join with Paulo diaz and so altogether to war against the king of angola but arrive at the shore where they be to pass over the river Bengo within 12. mile of Loanda and where they shall have meet with many bark to carry the camp to the other shore partly because the say bark have slack their come and partly because much time will have be spend in transport so many man the whole army take their way quite over the river and so go on forward they meet with the people of the king of angola that be ready to stop the soldier of congo the military order of the people of congo from enter upon their country the military order of the mociconghi for by that term we do call the natural bear people of the kingdom of congo as we call the spaniard those that be natural bear in Spain and the military order of the people of angola be almost all one for both of they do usual fight on foot and divide their army into several troop fit themselves according to the situation of the field where they do encamp and advance their ensign and banner in such sort as before be remember the remove of their army be guide and direct by certain several sound and noise that proceed from the captain general how the soldier do understand the pleasure of their general who go into the midst of the army and there signify what be to be put in execution that be to say either that they shall join battle or else retire or put on forward or turn to the right hand and to the left hand or to perform any other warlike action for by these several sound distinct deliver from one to another they do all understand the commandment of their captain as we here among we do understand the pleasure of our general by the sundry stroke of the drum and the captain sound of the trumpet three kind of instrument use in their war three principal sound they have which they use in war one which be utter aloud by great rattle fasten in certain wooden case hollow out of a tree and cover with leather which they strike with certain little handle of ivory another be make by a certain kind of instrument fashion like a pyramid turn upward for the low end of it be sharp and end as it be in a point and the upper end wax broad and broad like the bottom of a triangle in such sort that beneath they be narrow and like a angle and above they be large and wide this instrument be make of certain thin plate of iron which be hollow and empty within and very like to a bell turn up side down they make they ring by strike they with wooden wand and oftentimes they do also crack they to the end that the sound shall be more harsh horrible and warlike the three instrument be frame of elephant tooth some great and some small hollow within and blow at a certain hole which they make on the side of it in manner of the fife and not aloft like the Pipe these be temper by they in such sort that they yield as warlike and harmonious music as the cornet do and so pleasant and jocund a noise that it move and stir up their courage and make they not to care for any danger whatsoever now of these three several sort of warlike instrument there be some big and some less the use of these instrument for the captain general carry always with he the great sort to the end that by they he may give signification to the whole camp what they shall do the particular band and troop of the army have in like manner their small sort and every captain in his several regiment have also one of the small which they strike with their hand whereupon it fall out that when they hear the sound of the general rattle or cornet or the other three kind of instrument every part of the army do present answer in the same note signify thereby that they have well understand the good pleasure of the captain and so consequent the under captain do the like neither do they only use these instrument and sound universal but also when they be in fight in skirmish the valiant and courageous soldier go before the rest and with this kind of bell which they strike with their wooden wand they dance and encourage their fellow and by the note do signify unto they in what danger they be and what weapon they have meet withal the military apparel of the better sort the military apparel of the better sort and of the lord of the Moci-conghi be this on their head they carry a cap which be garnish with sundry plume of the feather of the ostrich of the peacock of the cock and of other kind of bird which make they to seem man of great stature than they be and terrible to look upon from the girdle upward they be all naked and have hang about they from their neck both on the right side and on the left even as low as to both their flank certain chain of iron with rings upon they as big as a man little finger which they use for a certain military pomp and bravery from the girdle downwards they have breech of linen or sandal which be cover with cloth and reach down to their heel but then they be fold again upward and tuck under their girdle upon their girdle which as we tell you be make with exquisite and curious work they do fasten certain bell very like to the instrument that be before name which in move of themselves and in fight with their enemy do ring and make a noise and courage unto they while they be in combat with their adversary upon their leg they have likewise their buskin after the Portugal fashion their weapon their armour we have already declare that be to say bow and arrow sword dagger and target but yet with this caveat that whosoever wear a bow he wear also a dagger but no target for those two weapon may not be wear together but sword and target they may lawful wear both at once the common soldier go all naked from the girdlestead upward the military apparel of the mean sort and have the rest of their body arm with bow and arrow and dagger these be they that do first offer the skirmish go out before the rest of the army as it be several and disperse provoke to fight and receive the shot from a far of they turn and wind this way and that way and do nimble leap from one side to another to the end they may avoid the light of their enemy arrow beside these there be also certain quick and gallant young man that run out before the rest which with the ring of their bell as afore be say be as it be comforter of their fellow and when they have fight so much that the captain think they to be even weary then do he call they back with the sound of one of those instrument above mention so that perceive the medley to wax hot they turn about and retire themselves back again and other succeed in their place which course be still observe and keep until such time as both the army do indeed join all their main force together and so fight it out in the place above describe the issue of this battle there be sundry encounter on the one side and on the other and in the first battle the people of congo remain conqueror but afterward when they have diverse time fight together with great loss on both side and victual begin now to fail and consequent man wax sick and die the camp of the king of congo be dissolve and every man return to his own home in this mean while Paulo diaz p. diaz at Luiola though he can not join his force with the army of his friend that come to succour he yet set himself forward and pass over the river stay at Luiola because it be a place very strong and fit to resist the king of angola the situation of Luiola be this the two river Coanza and Luiola do join together about 105. mile from the sea shore and a little above the say join together these river do seaver themselves for the space of a harquebus shot so that they make as it be a island between they in which island at the meeting of the two river there rise a hill which Paulo diaz surprise and fortify for his better safety and whereas in time pass there be never any habitation there now at this present it be grow to be a pretty country inhabit by the Portugal from this place thus surprise by Paulo diaz and call Luiola you may sail along the river with certain small vessel even to the sea and go by land without any danger for the space of one hundred and five mile the hill of Cabambe near thereunto be the hill that be call the hill of Cabambe produce infinite store of silver which the say diaz do every day by little and little endeavour to conquer and these hill be the grand quarrel between he and the people of angola for know that the Portugal do esteem great of these hill in regard of the silver pit which be there in great abundance they do use all the force and skill they can to keep the Portugal from they they fight also with they in diverse other place for the Portugal pass over the river Coanza do continual make inroad into the country that be subject to the king of angola the weapon of these people be bow six handful long the weapon of the people of angola with string make of the bark of tree and arrow of wood less than a man little finger and six handful long they have iron head make like a hook and feather of bird in the top of they and of these arrow they use to carry to the number of six or seven upon their bow hand without any quiver at all their dagger be fashion with a haft after the manner of a knife which they wear at their girdle on their left side and hold they aloft in their hand when they fight with they their military action by their military action and proceed you may observe their great skill and good order in matter of war for in diverse battle that be between they and the Portugal it be plain see how they can choose their advantage against their enemy as by assault they in the night time and in rainy weather to the end that their harquebuse and gun shall not take fire and also by divide their force into many troop to trouble they the more the king do not use to go to the war in his own person but send his captain in his steed the people be also accustom to fly and run away incontinent as soon as they see their captain slay neither can they be persuade to stay by any reason or argument but present yield up the field they be all footman neither have they any horse at all and therefore the captain if they will not go on foot cause themselves to be carry on the shoulder of their slave after one of the three manner which we will show unto you hereafter this nation go out to war in number almost infinite and very confuse they leave no man at home that be fit to carry a weapon they make no preparation of victual necessary for the camp but such as perhaps have any convey it with they upon the shoulder of their servant and yet they have sundry sort of creature that may be manage and serve their turn to draw and to carry as in the second part of this treatise shall be describe unto you and thereupon it fall out that when they come into any country with their whole army all their food be quick quite consume and then have nothing left to feed upon they dissolve their host even in the great necessity of prosecute their enterprise and so be enforce by hunger to return into their own country they be great give to divination by bird if a bird chance to fly on their left hand they be give to divination by bird or cry in such manner as those which make profession to understand the same do say that it foreshoweth ill luck and adversity or that they may go no further forward they will present turn back and repair home which custom be also in the old time observe by the ancient roman and likewise at this day by sundry other pagan now if it shall seem strange to any man why so small a number as Paulo diaz have with he be able to resist so huge a army of the k. of angola that so few Portugal soldier as Paulo diaz retain there with he and other of the Portugal nation which traffic into the realm and relieve he with succour be in number but three hundred at the most account their slave and also the malcontents the rebel and fugitive of angola which daily resort unto he and amount not in all to the quantity of 15 thousand man shall be able to make so gallant a resistance against that innumerable rabble of negro be subject to the king of angola which be gather there together as it be say to the number of a million of soul I answer that great reason may be allege for the same for the army of the negro be all naked and utter destitute of all provision and furniture for armour of defence and as for their weapon of offence they consist only but of bow and dagger as I tell you but our few Portugal that be there be well lap in certain jacket that be stuff and baste with bombast and stitch and quilt very sound which keep their arm very safe and their body downwards as low as their knee their head also be arm with cap make of the same stuff which do resist the shot of the arrow and the stroke of the dagger beside that they be gird with long sword and some horseman there be among they that carry spear for their weapon now you must understand that one man on horseback be of more worth than a hundred negro because the horseman do affray they great and especial of those that do discharge gun and piece of artillery against they they do stand continual in a extreme bodily fear so that these few be well arm and cunning and artificial order must needs overcome the other though they be very many in number this kingdom of angola the kingdom of angola very populous be full of people beyond all credit for every man take as many wife as he list and so they multiply infinite but they do not use so to do in the kingdom of congo which live after the manner of the christian and so signior odoardo do affirm and believe that the kingdom of angola have a million of fight man by reason that every man take to he as many wife as he will beget many child and likewise because every man do willing go to the war in the service of his prince this kingdom also be very rich in mine of silver and most excellent copper the commodity of angola and for other kind of mettle there be more in this kingdom then in any other country of the world whatsoever fruitful it be in all manner of food and sundry sort of cattle and special for great herd of kine true it be that this people do love dog flesh better than any other meat and for that that purpose they feed and fatten they and then kill they and sell they in their open shambles it be constant affirm a dog sell for 220. duccate that a great dog accustom to the bull be sell by exchange for 22 slave which after the rate of x. ducat a poll be worth in all 220. Duccates in so high a price and account do they hold that creature the money that be use in angola be much different from the lumache of congo the money of angola for they of angola do use bead of glass such as be make in Venice as big as a nut and some of lesser quantity and of diverse and sundry colour and fashion these do the people of angola make not only to use they for money but also for a ornament of their man and woman to wear about their neck and their arm and be call in their tongue Anzolos but when they be three upon a string like a pair of bead they call they Mizanga the king of angola be by religion a gentile the religion of angola and worship idol and so do all the people in his kingdom it be true that he have great desire to become a Christian after the example of the king of congo but because there have not be as yet any possibility to send priest unto he that may illuminate and instruct he he remain still in darkness the foresay signior odoardo tell i that in his time the king of angola send a ambassador to the king of congo request that he will send he some religious person to inform he in the christian religion but the king of congo have none there that he can spare and therefore can send he none at this day both these king do traffic together and be in amity one with another the king of angola have now clear and discharge himself for the injury and slaughter that be commit upon those of congo and upon the Portugal at Cabazo the language of the people of angola be all one with the language of the people of congo the language of the people of angola because as we tell you before they be both but one kingdom only the difference between they be as common it be between two nation that border one upon another as for example between the Portugal and the castilian or rather between the venetian and the calabrian who pronounce their word in a diverse manner and utter they in several sort although it be all one speech yet do they very hardly understand one another we have signify unto you heretofore that the bay of cow do divide the kingdom of angola in the midst and hitherto we have treat but of the one half thereof the rest of the kingdom of angola describe now we will describe unto you the second part of it which lie from the say bay of cow towards the south from this bay then to the black cape call Capo negro negro 1. the black cape by the coast of the ocean they do reckon two hundred and twenty mile of such country and soil as the former be and possess by many lord that be subject to the king of angola from Capo negro there run a line towards the east through the midst of the mountain that be call monti Freddi monti Freddi 1. the cold mountain that be to say the cold mountain which also in some certain part of they that be high than the rest towards the equinoctial be term by the Portugal monti nevosi or snowy mountain and so end at the root of other mountain that be call the mountain of crystal out of these snowy mountain do spring the water of the lake Dumbea Zocche the mounain of crystal this foresay line from the mountain of crystal draw onward towards the north through the mountain of silver till you come to Malemba where we tell you the kingdom of congo be divide and part the river of Coari in the midst and this be the country possess by the king of angola whereof I have no more to say then be already set down neither of the quality of his person nor of his court. chap. 8. of the circuit of the kingdom of congo possess by the king that now be according to the four border above describe begin therefore at the river Coanza and draw towards the equinoctial 375. mile you shall find the river that they call Barreras Vermellias the west contain 375. mile or the red pit which be indeed the ragged ruin of certain rock wear by the sea and when they fall down do show themselves to be of a red colour the north 540. from thence by a direct line upon the north that which the king possess be 450. mile and then the say line divide itself towards the south pass by the hill of crystal not those that we tell you before do belong to angola the east 500 but other that be call by the same name and so by the mountain of salnitro traverse the river Verbela at the root of the mountain of silver it end at the lake the south 360. which be the space of 500 mile the four line run along the river Coanza which issue out of the say lake and contain 360. mile so that the whole realm now possess by don Alvaro the king of congo be in compass 1685. mile the kingdom of congo contain in compass 1685. mile but the breadth thereof begin at the mouth of the river Zaire where the point be which in the Portugal speech be call Padraon and so cut the kingdom of congo in the middle and cross over the mountain of the sun and the mountain of crystal in breadth 600. mile there it end contain the space of 6^0 mile and within 150. mile near to the river Nilus very true it be indeed that in ancient time the predecessor of this prince do reign over many other country thereabouts which in process of time they have lose and although they be now in the government of other the title or style of the king of congo yet do the king of congo retain still to this day the title of those region as for example don Alvaro king of congo and of and of Matama and of Quizama and of angola and of Cacongo and of the seven kingdom of and of the pangelungo and lord of the river Zaire and of the and Anziquana and of Loango chap. 9 the six province of the kingdom of congo and first of the province of Bamba this kingdom be divide into six province that be to say Bamba Songo Batta and Pemba the province of Bamba which be the great and the rich be govern by don Sebastian mani Bamba the first province be Bamba and the description of it sebastian chief governor of Bamba and those that rule under he cousin to the king don Alvaro last decease and it be situate upon the sea coast from the river ambrize until you come to the river Coanza towards the south this don Sebastian have under his dominion many prince and lord and the name of the great of they be these don antonio mani-bamba who be lieutenant and brother to don Sebastian and mani-lemba another and mani-dandi and mani-bengo and mani-loanda who be governor of the island of Loanda and Mani-Corimba and mani-coanza and mani-cazzanzi all these do govern all the sea coast but within land for that part which belong to angola there be another people call the who dwell on the border of angola be subject to the say mani-bamba and they be these Angazi Chinghengo Motollo Chabonda and many other of base condition note that this word mani signify a prince or a lord mani what it signify and the rest of the word be the name of the country and lordship where the lord rule as for example mani-bamba signify the lord of the country of Bamba and Mani-Corimba the lord of the country of Corimba the confine of Bamba which be a part of Bamba and so likewise of the rest this province of Bamba confine with angola the country of Quizama on the south and upon the east of it towards the lake Achelunda lie the country of Quizama which be govern like a common wealth and be divide among a number of lord who in deed live at their own liberty do neither obey the king of congo nor the king of angola and to be short these lord of Quizama after they have a long time quarrel with Paulo diaz yet at last they become his subject because they will avoid the yoke of the king of angola and by their good aid and assistance do Paulo diaz great help himself against the say king of angola now the aforesaid country of Bamba Bamba the principal province of all congo as we have tell you be the principal province of all the realm of congo and in deed the very key and the buckler and the sword and the defence thereof and as it be the frontier which oppose itself against all their enemy for it resist all the revolte and rebellion of those quarter and have very valorous people in it that be always ready for to fight so that they do continual keep their adversary of angola in great awe and if it happen at any time that their king stand in need they be always at his command to annoy the other country whensoever when need require Bamba yield for a need 400000 man of war he may have in camp four hundred thousand man of war and yet that number be but only the six part of the whole kingdom though indeed it be the better part and the strong the principal city of this province lie in the plain which be between the river Loze and ambrize Panza the principal city of Bamba and be call Panza which be a common name for every town there dwell the lord of the province and it be distant from the sea a hundred mile in this signory also do the hill begin mine of silver and other metal where the mine of silver and other metal be find and so stretch out towards the kingdom of angola it be very rich for upon the coast of the sea there they have great store of the Lumache which be use for money over all the kingdom of congo beside there be also a great traffic and market for slave that be bring out of angola then in any place else for there be yearly buy by the Portugal above five thousand head of negro which afterwards they convey away with they and so sell they into diverse part of the world the people of this province be in arm the most valiant of all the kingdom of congo valiant mighty and strong man in Bamba they go arm like the sclavonian with long and large sword that be bring they out of Portugal there be among they very mighty man that will cleave a slave in the midst at one blow and cut of the head of a bull at one stroke with one of those sword and that which be more and will peradventure seem incredible one of these valiant man do bear upon his arm a certain vessel of wine which be the four part of a butt and may weigh about 325. pound until it be clean empty moreover they do carry bow and arrow whereat they be very quick and nimble and withal their long target make of the daunt skin whereof we tell you before when we make mention of the Anzichi the creature that be find in this province be first the elephant certain creature in Bamba province elephant which do breed over all the kingdom of congo but principal in the country of Bamba because it abound in wood in pasture and in water more than any of the rest by reason of the many river that run through it and therefore the country be as it be appropriate to nourish and breed such a kind of beast as be indeed of a unreasonable bigness a elephants foot 4. span broad for signior odoardo tell i that he have oftentimes take the measure of a elephants foot in the dust you may find hereby what the bigness of the whole elephant be if you will use the art of proportion as Pythagoras do by the foot of Hercules Aul. lib. 1. cap. 10. and one of they be in plain diameter four span broad whereby if you frame the whole circle of the foot according you may by proportion find out the bigness of the whole body of the beast this foot they call malo-manzao that be to say the foot of a elephant and if in Portugal in Italy and in Germany there have be see in our time any of these creature that be far lesser in respect of the aforesaid hugeness you must understand that they be but young and bring into those country in their tender age of purpose to make they tame the elephant live 150. year but in these quarter they say that the elephant do live a hundred and fifty year and that until the middle of their age they continue still in grow a elephant tooth of 200. weight and to confirm this truth he add that he have see and weigh diverse of their tooth which be not of home as some think and their weight amount to 200. pound a piece after the rate of 12 ounce to every pound in the language of congo the elephant tooth be call mene-manzao that be to say the tooth of a elephant and their young one be call moana-manzao that be a young elephant their ear be great than the great target that the turk use to wear in length six span in shape like a Eglantine and towards their shoulder they grow to be narrow and sharp with their ear and with their trunk and with their tail they beat away the fly that trouble they yea and some have leave it in writing that where they can reach with their trunk with their ear or with their tail they will gather their skin together and so nip the poor fly to death between the wrinkle they have in their tail certain hair or bristle as big as rush or broom-sprig certain hair in the elephant tail very precious of a shine black colour the old they be the fair and strong they be and of great price among they for the people of that country do great esteem they because the noble man and woman of the kingdom of angola and of the their neighbour do use to adorn and bedeck their neck withal and therefore do love they for that they be indeed very fair and rare and grow upon so goodly a beast they be very strong and like a twine cord so that if a man shall strive to break they asunder with both his hand he shall not be able with all his force and strength to crack they but rather spoil his hand with they and for the cause late rehearse many there be which wait for the elephant when they ascend some steep and narrow way do come behind they and with very sharp knife cut of their tail the poor beast be not able in those strait to turn back to revenge itself not with his trunk to reach his enemy and this they do only to have those hair which they sell for two or three slave a piece other light and courageous person there be that trust much to their swiftness in run do he in a wait and set upon the poor beast behind while they be in feed and at one blow attempt to cut off their tail and so endeavour to save themselves by run away in a round for the greatness of the beast be such as outright it be very swift because it make very large stride though in deed but slow and in the plain be far quick than any lusty horse but in turn round it lose much time and so the huntsman escape in safety and therefore many have be surprise and slay by the elephant that have seek to escape from they by run away outright our ancestor a error of ancient writer be not well inform in these matter have leave in writing that the elephant can not lie down upon the ground but that they use to lean themselves against a tree which be before weaken or saw in sunder by the hunter both the elephant and the tree fall down to the earth and so be take but signior odoardo affirm upon his credit that they lie down upon the ground that they kneel upon their knee and that they will with both their forefoot leap upon the tree to feed on the leaf and stoop down to drink of the water that be in their cave and that they have their jointe as other creature have save that in some part they do somewhat differ from other as for example from the hoof of their forefoot up to their shoulder you shall not perceive that they have any more than two joint in their feed they use to shake and root up the great tree with the force of their shoulder the manner of the elephant feed and strength of their whole back but the small tree they take between both their tooth and so bow they and pluck they down that they may feed upon the leaf of they insomuch as sometime they break one of their tooth with so do and this be the cause why you shall find diverse of they in the field that have lose their tooth they chew their meat with their short tooth which be not see as their two long tusk be and they carry it to their mouth by their long Snout or trunk which be to they in steed of a arm and a hand the tip of their trunk be fashion and divide into little slit and as it be finger wherewith they will take up very small thing as nut and straw and berry and so reach they to their mouth as I Philippo Pigafetta have see myself at Lisbon the female of these creature do bear their brood in their womb for the space of two year and no more the shee-elephant and forasmuch as the young elephant can so quick be bring up for it grow very slow the milk be keep from it and so it wax apt to feed of itself and therefore mother nature have provide that the elephant be not great with young but from seven year to seven year their skin be hear beyond all credit the elephant skin for be four finger thick it can be pierce no not with the shot of a harquebus and signior odoardo report that with a little gun which be call a Petreraa one of they be strike without any wound make but indeed he be grievous bruise so that he run away from that place all in a rage the space of three day journey and there die after he have slay certain slave that he meet by the way the manner of take the elephant the people of that country have not the skill to tame these beast whereby they may reap great commodity and profit for carry their stuff from place to place for diverse other good use but yet they take they by dig certain deep trench in the place where they use to pasture which trench be very narrow at the bottom and broad above to the end the beast may not help himself and leap out when he be fall into they these trench they cover with sod of earth and grass and leaf because the beast shall not see their train but pass over they remain there entrench whereupon the gentleman beforenamed tell i that he have see with his own eye a very strange and admirable thing in Coanza a strange effect of nature namely that a young elephant follow his dam fall down by chance into one of these pit and after that she can not with all her skill and strength draw he out of it she bury he therein and cover he with earth with branch and with bow insomuch as she fill the pit up to the top to the end that the hunter shall not enjoy her calf choose rather to kill it herself then to leave it to the mercy of the cruel huntsman this love and kind mother not fear the people that stand round about she and shout against she and threaten she with sundryweapon and utter strange clamour and noise to affray she and cast many fire at she but assure herself in her own strong and valiant nature do labour and toil from morning till night that she may draw her calf out of the pit and when she find that it be not possible for she to achieve what she desire than she cover it in manner as we have tell you the elephant be a very gentle beast and trust great in his natural strength he fear nothing nor hurt any man that do not trouble he the nature of the elephant and haunt near to man house without do any harm at all if he espy man that go in his walk he will not meddle with they unless they seek to molest he save that sometime peradventure he will gentle with his Snout hoist they upward into the air who he meet withal in his way and that be all the hurt he will do unto they these elephant do great delight in water and if a man be desirous to see they his best way be to lie somewhere nigh to the river and lake where they use to haunt about noon tide to drink to refresh themselves and to bathe their body in the water for there they will stand up to their belly and all the rest of their body that be above the water they will wash all over with the water that they snuff up into their snout for that purpose and because there be so many ford and pasture as be say in the kingdom of congo therefore be there very great store of these creature in that country for signior odoardo affirm that in the way between Cazanze and Loanda in a little grassy valley he have see about a hundred of they in a company old and young that follow their dam and these be the first young one that ever he see till that day and herewithal you must understand that they use to go together in herd as kine and camel and other such like gentle creature do and not alone like lion and other such wild beast now the reason why this country abound so in ivory be easy to be yield for so many elephant be breed in that region they make no account of that commodity in time past but only after that the Portugal begin to traffic with those country it grow in estimation and so have gather together in so many age a infinite quantity thereof which they find in their field they have sell they till this day at a very good pennyworth it be not know rhinoceros whether there be in that country any other beast that be so big as a elephant be nor whether there breed therein any rhinoceros which be a creature as big indeed as the elephant and in India be call a but yet there be bring into the country of the Anzichi some of their horn that grow upon their nose that be both of great value and estimation and also use for the help of diverse disease so that it be very credible and likely that there be some of they to be find in those quarter there be also to be find in this country certain other fourfooted beast the Dantes somewhat less than ox of colour red with horn like goat horn which be very smooth and glister and incline to black whereof they make diverse pretty knack as they do likewise of the buff horn they have their head and their hair like the head and hair of ox and their skin be of great estimation and therefore they be carry into Portugal and from thence into Germany to be dress and then they be call Dantes the king of congo be very desirous to have some man that have skill to cleanse they and dress they and to make they fit for use to the end he may employ they for armour of defence and yet those nation do already use they for shield and target and do find that they will resist the blow of a weapon and especial the shot of a arrow they kill they with harquebuse and with arrow but if they do espy the huntsman they will set upon he and be by nature very fierce and courageous they will so knock he and thump he with their foot and their muzzle because they can do he any harm with their horn that they will leave he either half dead or stark dead there be also a infinite number of wild buff wild buff wild ass that go wander about the desert in the kingdom of the Anzichi and wild ass likewise which the greek call there be beside these other beast call Empalanga Empalanga which be in bigness and shape like ox save that they hold their neck and head aloft and have their horn broad and crooked three long divide into knot and sharp at the end whereof they may make very fair cornet to sound withal and although they live in the forest yet be they not noisome nor harmful the skin of their neck be use for shoe-sole and their flesh for meat they may likewise be bring to draw the plough and do good service in any other labour and till of the ground moreover they feed great herd of kine and tame ox other fruitful cattle tame hog and wild boar flock of sheep and goat signior odoardo affirm that the goat and the sheep do bring forth two and three and four lamb or kid at a time and two when they have few and never one alone at any time and because their pasture be so fat they do all suck and milk their own dam which he prove himself to be true in his own house where he have very great store of that cattle there be wolf also which love the oil of palm beyond all measure wolf and have a great send a property that Virgile attribute to dog the smell send of dog they will smell this oil a far off and steal it in the night time out of their house of straw and sometime from those that carry it by the way while the poor soul do rest themselves and sleep the oil as shall be tell you be make of the palm tree it be thick and hard like butter and it be a marvel to see how these wolf do take a bottle that be full of this liquor between their tooth and so cast it on their shoulder and run away withal as our wolf here do with a sheep there be very great store of fox fox that steal hen as our fox do and further in this country of Bamba there be a innumerable quantity of hunt game hunt game as stag falo-dee roebuck and Gazelles whereof he affirm that he have see exceed great herd as also of coney and hare because there be no hunter to kill they in the region of Pemba there be many wild civet-catte in Civet cat which the Portugese call Algazia and some of these the people of that country have make tame that they may enjoy their civet in the smell whereof they do great delight but this be before the portugese do traffic with those country and in Manibatta there be catch many sable in Batta sable with very white hair and exceed fine call but no man may wear these skin unless the prince permit he so to do for it be hold in great estimation and every sable be worth a slave towards the Anzichi they catch Marterns also in marten wherewith they apparel themselves as in due place we will note unto you ape in (@) and monkey monkey and such other kind of beast small and great of all sort there be many in the region of that lie upon the river Zaire some of they be very pleasant and gamesome and make good pastime and be use by the lord there for their recreation and to show they sport for although they be unreasonable creature yet will they notable counterfeit the countenance the fashion and the action of man in every one of these region abovenamed there be some of the aforesaid creature in some place more and in some place few of adder and snake in these country there breed a certain kind adder and snake of a huge scantling that in respect of our country be very strange and of a excessive greatness for you shall find some that be 25 span long and five span broad and the belly and the mouth so large that they can swallow and receive into their belly a whole stag or any other creature of that bigness and it be call that be to say a great water-adder the author do not set down the name it will go forth of the water up to the land to prey for his victual and then return into the river again and so it live in both the element it will get itself up upon the bow and branch of tree and there watch the cattle that feed thereabouts which when they be come near unto it present it will fall upon they and wind itself in many twine about they and clap his tail on their hinder part and so it strain they and bite so many hole in they that at last it kill they and then it draw they into some wood or other solitary place where it devour they at pleasure skin horn hoof and all now it fall out that when it be thus full and as it be great with so monstrous a meal it become almost drink and very sleepy so that any child may kill it and in this sort will it remain full and satisfy for the space of 5. or 6. day together and then return again to prey these adder do change their skin in their ordinary season yea and sometime after they have eat so monstrous and the say slough when they be find be gather up and reserve for a show of so unmeasurable a creature these adder be also great esteem by the pagan negro for they do use to roast they and eat they for meat and make more account of they then they do of hen or any such delicate flesh they find great store of they when they have occasion to burn their thick wood for there they shall have they lie on the ground roast with the fire beside these there be viper also viper well know unto that people which viper be so venomous that such as be bite by they do die within the space of 24 hour but the negro be acquaint with certain herb that will heal their wound there be also certain other creature another strange creature which be as big as ram have wing like dragon with long tail and long chap and diverse row of tooth and feed upon raw flesh their colour be blue and green their skin bepaynt like scale and two foot they have but no more the pagan negro do use to worship they as god and at this day you may see diverse of they that be keep for a marvel and because they be very rare the chief lord there do curious preserve they and suffer the people to worship they which tend great to their profit by reason of the gift and oblation which the people offer unto they there be there also to be find chameleon chameleon which have four foot and breed upon the rock and live of the wind and the air of the bigness and likeness of a eft with a sharp head and a tail like a saw they be for the most part of the colour of the sky but somewhat more dusky and greenish and if you stand to look a while upon they you shall see they change themselves into diverse colour they dwell much upon high rock and tree to the end they may take air wherewith they be nourish other serpent there be that be venomous that carry upon the tip of their tail a certain little roundel like a bell a strange serpent which ring as they go so as it may be hear it may be it be there set by nature of purpose that people shall beware of they and it be find by experience that these bell and the head of the serpent be very good remedy against a ague and against the tremble of the heart these kind and sort of land-creature be to be find in these region beside other also that be common to be have in other country it rest now that we speak somewhat touch bird the ostrich and first of all of the ostrich because it be big than all the rest these ostrich be find in those part of and of Batta that be towards the Muzambi the young ostrich do spring out of their egg be warm and disclose by the eye and heat of the sun their feather be use in steed of ensign and banner in war peacock mingle with some plume of the peacock and be fashion in the likeness of a shadow against the sun and forasmuch as I be fall into the speech of peacock I must tell you by the way that in the part of angola there be peacock bring up private in a certain wood that be compass about with wall and the king will not suffer any other body to keep those bird but only himself because they be for the royal ensign as I tell you before and it be read in ancient history of Alexander the great that he do also privilege this bird at such time as he first see it in Europe there be also indie-cocke and hen and goose and duck of all sort both wild and tame fowl of diverse sort partridge so many as child take they with begin other bird they have likewise as pheasant which they call gallignole pigeon bird of prey turtle and of these small bird call Becca a infinite number bird of prey as eagles-royal falcon gerfaulcon and spar-hawk and other great store which notwithstanding the people never use to hawk withal bird of the sea as pelican for so the Portugal do call they white and great bird of the sea which swim under the water and have their throat so wide that they will swallow a whole fish at once this bird have so good a stomach and natural so hot that it easy digest the fish that it swallow whole and the skin of it be so hot that the people of that country do use to wear they and to warm their cold stomach withal and therefore make great reckon of they there be many white heron and grey bittern other kind of foul that feed in the wash there and be call royal bird other fowl there be of the likeness of a crane with a red bill and red foot as big as stork and their feather for the most part red and white and some dark grey goodly bird they be to look too and the people of the country do call they fleming because they do much resemble they and be good meat to eat they have parrot of gray colour parrot bird of music great and very talkative and other of

be great store of spring of indifferent good water to drink and at certain time do not harm any man and of all sort of cattle great abundance the top of the mountain be sever and distinguish from all the rest of the hill which be about it and therefore the Portugal do call it the Otheiro the Otheiro that be to say a view or a watch tower or a singular height from whence you may take a sight of all the champaign round about only towards the east and towards the river it be very steep and rocky for two cause do the first prince of this kingdom place this habitation in the foresay height of this mountain the reason why they build in this place first because it lie in the very midst and as it be in the centre of all the realm from whence he may present send aid to any part of his kingdom that may stand in need of relief and second because it be situate in a territory that be by nature mount aloft have a very good air and of great safety for it can be force by the chief common high way that go up to the city and look towards the sea be distant from thence 150. Miles as have be tell you which way be very large and competent though it go somewhat about encompass you shall ascend five Miles from the bottom to the top of the mountain five mile from the bottom of the hill to the top at the foot thereof on the east side there run a river whereunto the woman do descend by the space of a mile walk to wash their clothes a river at the hill foot in diverse other part thereof there be sundry valley plant and manure neither do they suffer any part of the country thereabouts to be leave untilled or unused because it be the country where the court remain the city be seat in a corner or angle of the hill towards the southeast the particucular situation of the city which don Alfonso the first Christian king do compass about with wall and give unto the Portugal a several place for themselves a several place for the Portugal shut up likewise within wall then do he also enclose his own palace and the king with another wall and in the midst between these two enclosure leave a great space of ground where the principal church be build the principal church and market place with a fair market place before it the door and gate aswell of the lodging of the lord as of the Portugal inhabitation do open on the side of the say church for in the uppermost end of the market place do diverse great lord of the court dwell and behind the church do the market place run into a narrow street where there be also a gate and beyond that gate many house towards the east without these wall which do enclose the king house and the city of the Portugal there be a number of other building erect by diverse lord every man make his several choice of the place which he think most fit and convenient for his dwell near unto the Court so that the greatness of this city can well be determine or limit beyond these wall also that thus do compass this city there be a great champagne plain full of village and sundry palace where every lord possess as it be a whole town within himself the circuit of the Portugal city contain about a mile and the king house as much the wall be very thick the gate be not shut in the night time neither be there any watch or ward keep therein and although that plain do lie very high and aloft good store of water yet be there great abundance of water in it so that there be no want thereof but the court and the Portugal city do all drink of a certain fountain that spring continual towards the north and lie down the hill as far as a gun will shoot and from hence they do fetch all their water and bring it to the city in vessel of wood of earth and of leather upon the back of their slave all this plain be very fruitful the plain very fruitful several sort of grain and well manure it have meadow full of grass and tree that be always green it bear sundry sort of grain but the principal and best of all be call Luco Luco which be very like to mustardseed but that it be somewhat big when it be grind with hand-querns for so they use to do it yield a very white meal whereof they make bread that be both white and also of a very good savour and wholesome withal neither do it give place to our wheat in any sort save that they do not celebrate the sacrament with it of these grain there now be great store over all the kingdom of congo but it be not long since that this seed be bring thither from that part of the river Nilus where it fall into the second lake white Milles call the Mazza of congo there be also a white kind of millet call the Mazza of congo that be to say the corn of congo and another grain which they call Maiz Maiz but they make no account of it for they give it to their hog neither do they great esteem of Rice the foresay Maiz they common term by the name of mazza-manputo that be to say the Portugal corn for they call a Portugal Manputo there be moreover diverse and sundry sort of tree diverse kind of tree bear fruit that bear very great store of fruit insomuch as the great part of the people do feed upon the fruit of the country as citron lemon and special orange very full of liquor which be neither sweet nor sour and be ordinary eat without any annoyance or harm at all and to show the fruitfulness of this country the say signior odoardo report that he have see from a kernel of the fruit of a pome-citrone which be leave within the rind thereof there spring up within the space of four day a pretty tall sprig other fruit there be which they call Banana Banana and we very think to be the muse of Egypt and Soria save that in those country they grow to be as big as tree but here they cut they yearly to the end they may bear the better the fruit be very sweet in smell and of good nourishment in these plain there grow likewise sundry kind of palm-tree diverse kind of palm-tree one that bear date and another that bear the indian nut call because they have within they a certain shell that be like to a ape and thereupon they use in Spain to show their child a Coccola when they will make they afraid another palm tree there grow also very like to the former but of a more strange and singular property for it yield oil the oil of palm wine vinegar fruit and bread the oil be make of the shalt of the fruit and be of the colour and substance of butter save that it be somewhat greenish they use it as other people do use oil and butter and it will burn like oil they anoint their body withal and beside it be very good to eat they press it out of the fruit as oil be press out of the olive and then they boil it and so preserve it the bread be make of the stone of the fruit itself the bread of palm which be like to a almond but somewhat hard and within the same be there a certain kernel or pith which be good to eat very wholesome and of good nourishment the fruit of the palm the whole fruit together with the utter shall be green and they use to eat it both raw and roast the wine be draw from the top of the tree the wine and vinegar of palm by make a hole therein from whence there distill a liquor like milk which at the first be sweet but afterwards sour and in process of time become very vinegar to serve for salad this wine they drink cold and it move to urine very much so that in those country there be not a man that be trouble with gravel or stone in the bladder it will make they drink that drink too much of it but in deed it be of a very good nutriment wherein you must note that they do not build thus rustical and shepherd-like for want of stuff to build withal great store of stone to build with all for in the mountain of the realm of congo there be a number of place that yield most exquisite fine stone of diverse kind from whence you may dig out whole pillar and principal and base and other piece as big as you listen if you be dispose to build insomuch as it have be confident affirm that there be to be find among they many mass and lump of stone which be of such thickness and hugeness that you may cut out a whole church even of one whole piece yea and of the same kind of stone whereof the be make that be erect before portadel in Rome beside this there be whole mountain of Porphyry of jasper and of white marble and of other sundry colour which here in Rome be call marble of Numidia of Africa and of Aethiopia certain pillar whereof you may see in the chapel of pope Gregory other stone there be that be speckle with grain or strike but among all the rest that kind be most admirable which have in it fair jacinthe that be good jewel for the streak be disperse like vein over all the body of their mother-stone if you shall divide they and pluck they out as you will pick the kernel out of a pomegranate they will fall into grain and little piece of perfect jacinth but if you please to make pillar or obelisk or other such like memorials of the whole mass you shall see they shine and sparkle full of most fair and goodly jewel there be also other kind of rare stone which make a show of mettle in they as of copper and of sundry other colour that be very fresh and bright and smooth whereof you may make image or any other work of singular beauty and therefore it be not the scarcity of matter or stuff that be the cause of this their simple building see that their mountain have such plenty of the foresay stone yea and perhaps more store of other kind then be to be find in any other place of the whole world lime and timber and cattle to carry and draw want of workman to build beside lime and tree for beam and cattle both for carriage and draw in the cart and all other manner of provision that be requisite for building true it be in deed that they want mason and cutter and plasterer and carpenter and other such artificer for when the church and the wall and the other fabric in those country be build the workman be bring thither out of Portugal there be also tamarind Stuffe for build ship and house and cassia and ceda in such multitude grow all along the river of congo beside other tree of a unmeasurable length and thickness that a infinite number of ship and house may be build of they their garden do bear all manner of herb and fruit herb and fruit as pompion melon cucumber colewort and such like beside other sort that do not agree with our climate of Europe chap. 2. of the original beginning of Christendom in the kingdom of congo and how the Portugal obtain this traffic the k. of Portugal don Giovanni the second the first traffic of the Portugal into congo be desirous to discover the east indies send forth diverse ship by the coast of Africa to search out this navigation who have find the island of Capo Verde and the isle of saint Thomas and run all along that coast do light upon the river Zaire whereof we have make mention before and there they have good traffic and try the people to be very courteous and kind afterward he send four for the same purpose certain other vessel to entertain this traffic with congo who find the trade there to be so free and profitable and the people so friendly left certain Portugal behind they to learn the language mani the k. uncle entertain the portugese and to traffic with they among who one be a mass-priest these Portugal converse familiar with the lord of who be uncle to the king and a man well strike in year dwell at that time in the port of Praza which be in the mouth of Zaire be very well entertain and esteem by the prince and reverence as though they have be earthly god and descend down from heaven into those country but the Portugal tell they that they be man as themselves be and professor of Christianity and when they perceive in how great estimation the people hold they the foresay priest and other begin to reason with the prince touch the christian religion and to show unto they the error of the pagan superstition Mani-sogno convert and become a christian. and by little and little to teach they the faith which we profess insomuch as that which the Portugal speak unto they great please the prince and so he become convert with this confidence and good spirit the prince of go to the court to inform the king of the true doctrine of the christian Portugal and to encourage he that he will embrace the christian religion which be so manifest and also so wholesome for his soul health hereupon the king command to call the priest to court to the end he may himself treat with he personal the king of congo promise to become a christian. and understand the truth of that which the lord of have declare unto he whereof when he be full inform he convert and promise that he will become a christian. and now the Portugal ship depart from congo and return into Portugal and by they do the king of congo write to the king of Portugal don Giovanni the second with earnest request that he will send he some priest with all other order and ceremony to make he a christian. the priest also that remain behind have write at large touch this business and give the king full information of all that have happen the k. of Portugal send priest to the k. of congo to instruct he agreeable to his good pleasure and so the king take order for sundry religious person to be send unto he according with all ornament for the church and other service as cross and image so that he be thorough furnish with all thing that be necessary and needful for such a action in the mean while the prince of cease not day and night to discourse with the Portugal priest Mani-sogno promote the christian religion who he keep in his own house and at his own table aswell that he may learn the christian faith himself as also instruct the people therein so that he begin to favour christianity with all his power and forasmuch as the christian religion have now take root and begin to bud in those country and for that both the people and also the king himself do continue in their earnest desire to purge themselves from that abominable superstition he do instant deal with the priest that he will proceed in the sow and disperse of the christian doctrine as much as he can and in this good affection do they wait for the Portugal ship that shall bring they all provision for baptism and other thing thereunto appertain at the last the ship of Portugal arrive with the expect provision which be in the year of our salvation 1491 and land in the port which be in the mouth of the river Zaire the ship return from Portugal 1491. Mani-sogno and his train entertain the portugese the prince of with all show of familiar joy accompany with all his gentleman run down to meet they and entertain the Portugal in most courteous manner and so conduct they to their lodging the next day follow according to the direction of the priest that remain behind Mani-sogno build a church the prince cause a kind of church to be build with the body and branch of certain tree which he in his own person with the help of his servant most devout have fell in the wood and when it be cover they erect therein three altar in the worship and reverence of the most holy Trinity mani and his son baptize and there be baptize himself and his young son himself by the name of our saviour Emanuel and his child by the name of Anthony because that saint be the protector of the city of Lisbon now if any man here demand of i what name the people of these country have what name the people of congo have before they be christen before they receive christianity of a truth it will seem incredible that I must answer they that be to say that the man and woman have no proper name agreeable to reasonable creature but the common name of plant of stone of bird and of beast but the prince and lord have their denomination from the place and state which they govern as for example the foresay prince which be the first Christian in congo be call Mani-sogno that be to say the prince of and when he be christen be call Emanuel but at this day they have all in general such christian name as they have learn of the Portugal after a mass be celebrate and song a sermon contain the sum of christian religion one of the priest that come from Portugal go up and make a brief sermon in the Portugal language declare the sum of the new religion and faith of the gospel which they have receive this sermon the priest that be leave behind have now learned the congo speech do more at large expound to the lord that be in the church for the church can not possible hold the innumerable multitude of the people that be there gather together mani rehearse the sermon to his people at the conversion of their prince who afterwards come abroad unto they and rehearse the whole sermon with great love and charity move and exhort they to embrace likewise the true belief of the christian doctrine when this be do all the portugese put themselves on their way towards the court the portugese go to the court to baptize the king to baptize the king who with a most fervent long attend the same and the governor of take order that many of his lord shall wait upon they with music and sing and other sign of wonderful rejoice beside diverse slave which he give they to carry their stuff command also the people that they shall prepare all manner of victua; to be ready in the street for they so great be the number of people that run and meet together to behold they as the whole champagne seem to be in a manner cover with they and they all do in great-kindness entertain and welcome the Portugal christian with sing and sound of trumpet and cymbal and other instrument of that country and it be a admirable thing to tell you that all the street and high way that reach from the sea to the city of saint saviour be one hundred and fifty mile be all cleanse and sweep and abundant furnish with all manner of victual and other necessary for the portugese in deed they do use in those country when the king or the principal lord go abroad to cleanse their way and make they handsome and therefore much the rather upon this special occasion when the portugese who they reverence as though they have be some of the old hero do purchase for their king the jewel of religion and salvation of his soul and general for every one of they the clear knowledge of God and of eternal life three day journey from the place whence they depart the courtier of congo meet the portugese they descry the king courtier that come to meet they to present they with fresh victual and to do they honour and so from place to place they encounter other lord that for the same purpose be send by the king to receive the christian who be the messenger and bringer of so great a joy when they be come within three mile near to the city all the court come to entertain and welcome the Portugal with all manner of pomp and joyfulness and with music and sing as in those country be use upon their solemn feast-day and so great be the multitude of people which abound in the street that there be neither tree nor hillock high than the rest but it be load with those that be run forth and assemble to view these stranger which bring unto they this new law of their salvation the king himself attend they at the gate of his palace the king himself recceyve they in a throne of estate erect upon a high scaffold where he do public receive they in such manner and sort as the ancient king of that realm accustom to do when any ambassador come unto he or when his tribute be pay he or when any other such royal ceremony be perform and first of all the ambassador declare the embassage of the king of Portugal the Portugal ambassador declare his embassage which be expound and interpret by the foresay priest that be the principal author of the conversion of those people after the embassage be thus deliver the k. rejoice at the embassage the king raise himself out of his seat and stand upright upon his foot do both with his countenance and speech show most evident sign of the great joy that he have conceive for the come of the christian and so sit down again the people rejoice at it and incontinent all the people with shout and sound their trumpet and sing and other manifest argument of rejoice do approve the king word and show their exceed good like of this embassage and further in token of obedience they do three time prostrate themselves upon the ground and cast up their foot according to the use of those kingdom thereby allow and commend the action of their king and most affectionate accept of the gospel which be bring unto they from the lord God by the hand of those religious person then the king take view of all the present that be send he by the king of Portugal the k. view the present send unto he by the k. of Portugal and the vestiment of the priest and the ornament of the altar and the cross and the table wherein be depaint the image of saint and the streamer and the banner and all the rest and with incredible attention cause the meaning of every one of they to be declare unto he one by one and so withdraw himself and lodge the ambassador in a palace make ready of purpose for he and all the rest be place in other house of several lord where they be furnish with all plenty and ease the day follow the king cause all the Portugal to be assemble together in private consultation among the portugese for the christen of the k. and for the build of a church where they devise of the course that be to be take for the christen of the king and for effect the full conversion of the people to the Christian faith and after sundry discourse it be resolve and conclude that first of all a church shall be build to the end that the christen and other ceremony thereunto belong may be celebrate therein with the more solemnity and in the mean while the king and the court shall be teach and instruct in the christian religion the king present command that with all speed provision shall be make of all manner of stuff necessary for this building as timber stone lime and brick according to the direction and appointment of the workmaster and mason which for that purpose be bring out of Portugal a insurrection raise by the devil to hinder the progress of christian religion but the devil who never cease to cross all good and holy proceed raise new dissension and conspiracy and let against this promote of the christian faith which in deed begin to overthrow and destroy the power that he have long hold in that realm and in steed thereof to plant the most healthful tree of the cross and the worship of the gospel and this he do by procure a rebellion among certain people of the Anzichi and of Anzicana which dwell upon both the bank of the river Zaire from the foresay fall upward to the great lake and be subject and belong to the king of congo now this monstrous river be restrain and keep back by these fall do swell there mighty and spread itself abroad in a very large and deep channel in the breadth whereof there be many island some small and some great so that in some of they there may be maintain about thirty thousand person in these island and in other place adjoin to the river thereabouts do the people make a insurrection and renounce their obedience to the king and slay the governor that he have send thither to rule and all this be do by the devil of purpose to interrupt the propagation of Christianity which be now begin and to hinder it by the mean of this rebellion but the king by the inspiration of God provide a good remedy for this mischief and send thither his elder son Mani-sundi go against the rebel call Mani-sundi within who province that country lie and yet afterwards the trouble and tumult fall out to be so great and dangerous that the king must needs go himself in person to pacify these broil howbeit he resolve to be baptize before his go and so be enforce to forbear the build of the church of stone and with all speed in steed thereof to erect one of timber which church he in his own person with the advice of the Portugal the k. build in haste a church of timber do accomplish in such manner and sort as it ought to be and therein do receive the sacrament of holy baptism and be name don Giovanni and his wife donna Eleonora the k. and q. of congo christen after the name of the king and queen of Portugal and the church itself entitle and dedicate to s. saviour the church of s. saviour but here it be to be note that all these stir and rebellion of the people aforesaid arise by the cunning sleight and instigation of the devil and not of the poor soul themselves that dwell in those island of the great lake the latin history of the indies do report amiss of this rebellion as it be write in the first book of the history of the indies late set forth in latin for the lake be distant from the confine of the city of congo about two hundred mile neither have the inhabitant thereabouts any knowledge of congo but only by hearsay in those day and very little they have of it as yet at this day and beside that the book be faulty in the name of that people that rebel for it call they Mundiqueti whereas in deed the Portugal do right call they Anziqueti the same day wherein the king be baptize diverse other lord follow his example be baptize likewise diverse lord baptize have first learn certain principle of the christian faith the k. go in person against the rebel and discomfit they and when all this be do the king go in person to disperse the turbulent attempt of his adversary against who he find the prince his son and the lord of Batta already fight with a formal army but at the arrival of the king the enemy yield and submit themselves to the obedience which before they perform and so he return in triumph to the city of congo and the prince his son with he who present be desirous to become a Christian and be christen by the name of the first prince of Portugal Mani-sundi christen and many other with he call Alfonso and with he also be christen many gentleman and cavaliero and other of his servant that come with he out of his province but see the devil once again the utter enemy of christian religion how he prosecute his former intent to hinder christianity among these people for when he perceive that he prevail nothing by these war he incense the mind of the king second son that he will not agree to receive the new keligion which his father Mani-pango resist the gospel his mother his brother so many other lord have embrace sow his cockle and darnel not only in he but also in many other lord that favour he who be addict rather to the sensuality of the flesh than the purity of the mind resist the gospel which begin now to be preach especial in that commandment wherein it be forbid that a man shall have any more wife but one a matter that among they be more hard and difficult to be receive than any other commandment whatsoever because they be use to take as many wife as they will and thus the two brother be divide between themselves either of they do stiff maintain his several opinion the elder brother don Alfonso do with great fervency defend christianity and burn all the idol that be within his province the second brother call Mani-pango because he be governor of the country of do resist it mighty and have get the great part of the principal lord of to be on his side for there be diverse of the new christen lord who lady see themselves separate and forlorn of their husband-lord by force of the christian law do take it as a great injury and scorn do unto they and blaspheme and curse this new religion beyond all measure these lord unite themselves together with other Mani-pango and his complice accuse Mani-sundi to his father and begin to plot treachery against don Alfonso hope that if they can rid he out of the world the christian faith will utter cease of itself and therefore Mani-pango and his complice give intelligence to his father that the prince don Alfonso favour the christian faction only to the end that under the colour of his countenance and favour they may raise a insurrection and rebellion against he and so drive he out of his kingdom the king give credit to their information the k. deprive Mani-sundi of his government and deprive his son of the government wherein he be place but the providence of God which reserve he for a great matter do relieve he by the good mediation and counsel of his friend who entreat the king his father that he will not be move to anger before he have examine the answer and reason of the prince his son wherein the king be especial persuade by Mani-sogno who as we tell you be before christen Mani-sogno make intercession for his brother and call don Emanuel and by good hap be in court at that present this man be the ancient courtier and lord of that time singular well belove of the king and all his people do with sound reason and dexterity of wit procure the king to revoke the sentence that be give against the prince don Alfonso so that the king be afterwards thorough inform both of the honest mind and action of his son perceive that the accusation plot against he be false and malicious Mani-sundi restore and thereupon restore he again to his former government with a special charge that he shall not proceed with such rigour against the gentile for the propagation and exaltation of the Christian religion but he be full of fervent charity and godly spirit cease not for all that to advance the faith of the gospel and to put the commandment of God in execution chap. 3. don John the first christian king be dead don Alfonso his son succeed of his war against his brother of certain miracle that be wrought and of the conversion of those people now together with the death of the king the funeral of k. John celebrate by k. Alfonso there be also publish the succession to the crown of don Alfonso be then present who in his own person do accompany the corpse of his dead father to the burial withal the lord of the court and all the Christian Portugal which be solemnize after the manner of Christendom with service and prayer for the dead and all this with such funeral pomp as be never see before among those people but they which heretofore be adversary to this new king doubt of their own safety if they shall remain in the court unite themselves with Mani-pango who be now depart into the province of his own government Mani-pango rebel against his brother and while his father live be whole employ in fight against the Mozombi and certain other people that have rebel against he when he hear of the death of his father and understand that his brother be already place in the seat royal he take truce with his enemy and gather together a great army begin to go in arm against his brother and lead with he almost all the whole realm which in deed favour he to the number of two hundred thousand man king Alfonso await his come at the royal city with a very small number save that he be direct advise and assist by the good ancient lord Mani-sogno who unite himself unto he in the strength and virtue of the holy christian faith the king power both slender and timorous and make a list of all those arm friend that he have to defend he against so great a enemy find by computation that they do not amount to the number of ten thousand among which there be but about one hundred christian natural of that country beside some few Portugal which by chance arrive there at that time all these people be indeed too few for such a encounter and therefore not very resolute to abide any attempt but become very doubtful and timorous by reason of the great power that Mani-pango bring with he but the king trust confident in his strong faith and in the celestial aid and assistance comfort and strengthen his soldier by all the mean he can and so do the good old lord his uncle who cease not both night and day with word and deed to encourage that small number which they have to expect and endure the assault of their adversary with all manhood and courage assure they that God will be their help and succour thus while they attend the proceed of their enemy Mani-pango and his force set forward to the besiege of the city with so great a noise of warlike instrument and cry and shouting and terrible threaten that the poor few which be in the city aswell christian as other faint in their heart and fail in their courage and come and present themselves before the king say that he have not power enough to resist so powerful a enemy and therefore they think it better for he to grow to some concord and composition and to abandon the new religion which he have late begin to profess to the end he may not fall into the hand of his cruel adversary the king to his soldier but the king be resolute and full of religious constancy reprove their cowardice and call they dastard and base people and will they if they have any mind or desire to forsake he and go to the enemy that they shall so do as for himself and those few that will follow he he do not doubt but assure trust though not with the possibility or strength of man yet with the favour of God to vanquish and overcome that innumerable multitude and therefore he will not request they either to join with he or to put their life in hazard against his adversary for his sake but only they may rest themselves and expect the issue that shall follow thereon but they for all this speech become never a whit the more courageous the king soldier depart from he but rather wax more timorous and be utter determine to forsake the king and to save themselves now they be scarce out of the city and on their way homewards when by great good fortune they meet with the good old lord Mani-sogno who with some few of his follower have be abroad to survey the enemy camp Mani-sogno meet with they and to make provision for such thing as be necessary in such a action to he they declare all that they have before declare to the king that they think it to be a point of express madness to put their life and good in danger with so few people against a infinite multitude and that without all doubt it be a safe way to compound with the enemy and so save themselves the good lord with great piety and christian valour answer they that they shall not so quick fall into despair but as the king have tell they before they shall look upon jesus Christ the saviour of the world who faith and religion they have so late and with so great zeal gain and purchase who also most assure and undoubted will succour and defend those that be he and so entreat they that they will not like rash head people change their mind from that holy doctrine which they have with such fervency of late receive add moreover that they have not to fight with a strange nation nor with a people that come from far country but with their own kinsman and countryman so that they may always have opportunity if need so require to yield themselves and in all friendship and kindness to be embrace behold I pray you say Mani-sogno my age now arrive to a hundred year and yet I bear arm for the zeal and defence of the religion that I have enter and for the homage and honour that I owe to my king and you that be in the flower of your year do you show yourselves to be so base and fearful and unfaithful to your own natural king if algate you be not mind to fight yourselves yet encourage your vassal and subject and do not dismay they let we expect the first encounter of the enemy and thereupon we shall not want fit occasion to take some other course and provide for our safety with these comfortable word the fugitive return and ask the king forgiveness the lord recover their spirit that be quail and return back with he to seek the king who be in the church at his prayer beseech God to send he help and succour they wait for he until he come forth and then kneel down upon their knee before he request pardon for their fault and want of duty which they have show unto he be their prince in that they will have forsake he when he be in this extreme danger and promise that they will put on a new and constant courage for the defence of he and of the law and religion which they have receive and that they will fight for the same even until death the k. give thanks to God but the king who perceive well that this comfort and help come from God himself first give he hearty thanks secret from the bottom of his heart and vow that he will sacrifice himself for the maintenance of his faith and gospel and then with a cheerful countenance he say I do believe lord that thy greatness be infinite and that thou can do all thing and can make of little much and of much little whensoever it please thou neither do I any thing doubt but that thou will yield aid to this my weakness and assist the same with thy invincible force so that through thy gracious favour with these few and weak person I shall become the conqueror not only of this army but also of a far great if it shall come against i and I promise thou o my God beside that which I have already speak that I will all the day of my life promote and exalt thy true faith thy holy name and thy most wholesome doctrine the king erect a cross of a great length in testimony and memory of which his confession he do present cause a cross to be plant and erect in the midst of the market place right against the church which his father have build this cross be of a wonderful length for it be fourscore span long and the cross-bar in proportion answerable thereunto now the eternal God who know the faith from whence this vow of the good king do proceed vouchsafe to comfort he with a celestial vision which be a very clear and admirable light at the shine whereof a vision appear to he he cast himself upon his knee and weep and lift up his hand and eye to heaven but speak not a word for that he be overcome with tear and sigh and whole ravish in spirit but that which he himself see be see of no body else neither will he ever publish the same to any man all those that be in his company do even as he do and for a while lose the sight of their eye and by reason of that miraculous light remain in a trance the arm of the king of congo at the last every man lift up his eye and perceive that there be imprint on he five sword very bright and clear which for the space almost of a hour continue unmovable as it be in a circle but all they can neither understand nor expound what be the meaning thereof the five sword the king take for his arm as be to be see in his signet royal which have be use ever sithence that time yea even by the king that now live and reign the cross also that be thus plant by vow be to be see in the same place wherein it be erect at the front of the church which church be call saint cross of the cross there plant and of the miracle that there appear this cross the last king that dead be don Alvaro father to the king that now be renew and make another of the same bigness that the first be of in remembrance of such a miracle for the old cross be in time decay and consume and quite fall down the aforesaid vision do great confirm the mind of the citizen which before be quail and do wonderful appall and full terrify the enemy when they understand the news thereof the proud message of Mani-pango to the King notwithstanding Mani-pango send unto the king and signify unto he and to all the rest that be with he that if they do not incontinent yield themselves and deliver the city unto he and create and swear he for their king and withal abandon and relinquish their new christian religion he will put they all to the edge of the sword but if they will so do he will free pardon they hereunto the lord that stand on the king part answer the king answer that they be most ready to die in defence of their prince and of the christian Faith but in particular the king send he this message that he nothing fear his terrible threat but rather as his kind brother be very sorry even from his heart to see that he walk in darkness and stray out of the way of light that the kingdom do by law belong unto he and be not fraudulent usurp by he and that the religion which he have receive be assure deliver he from God who no doubt will protect and maintain he therein and withal beseech he that he will estrange himself from his false belief and worship of the devil wherein he have be nourish and bring up and that he will be baptize for so he shall become the child of God and merit the glory celestial the king reward his follower then the king send to fetch his jewel and other rich ornament of household which he have at home and the better to encourage these lord that take his part he most gracious distribute they among they all wherewith they remain very great satisfy and bind themselves to prosecute his enterprise and to follow his ensign with a most ardent courage this be do the very same night the one half almost of the base people that be in arm certain timorous fugitive run to the camp of Mani-pango be surprise with a very great fear do secret fly into the camp of and have thus revolt give Mani-pango to understand that the king and all the rest of his retinue be utter dismay and discourage that every man be devise with himself how he may escape and that they have none other mean to save themselves but only by take the lane that lead down to the river which as we have tell you be distant from the city about the space of a mile at the end of which lane a stratagem of Mani-pango between the river and the hill there be a little Moor about two foot deep on the right hand and on the left hand be the mountain and the garrison of that have besiege and beset the hill so that there be none other issue for they to escape but only by pass over the Moor which be in length as far as the shot of a harquebus can reach and as much in breadth and then to come to the river Mani-pango believe all this that they have relate unto he send present to stop that passage with plant sharp stake in the bottom of the Moor which be cover with water to the end that if his enemy shall fly in the dark of the night because they will not be see they shall be all stake and take therein all that night he with all his army remain in great joy and await the fresh morning that he may give the assault upon the city bethink himself in the mean while what course may be most easy and convenient for he to attempt the same but don Alfonso on the other side have confess himself Mani-pango assault the city and consult with all the most faithful and loyal friend that he have expect his enemy who assure himself of the victory and have now grant all the citizen good and all the state and governemente of the kingdom to his great lord about he very early in the morning with a furious violence give assault to the city on that side which be towards the north where the great and wide plain restrain itself into a narrow strait enter as it be into a round circle natural compass about with certain hill and then make a large way as broad as a man may shoot with a gun until you come to the site or place where the city stand which be a little plain of two mile compass wherein as it have be tell you the city and the church and the lord house and the king court be situate in this place do don Alfonso with those few that he have with he settle himself against the pagan Mani-pango discomfit without any fight and against his enemy brother who before he can confront the king be utter discomfit disperse and put to flight whereupon the king perceive that he be overthrow and drive to run away be wonderful amaze not know himself how this matter come to pass see that he have not join battle nor fight with his enemy and therefore must needs think that it so fall out by some hide and secret mean to he unknown notwithstanding the day follow Mani-pango return to the assault in the same place Mani-pango the second time discomfit in like manner but he be in the same manner once again discomfit and constrain to fly whereby he know assure that this his loss and overthrow be not occasion by the valour of his enemy but only by some miracle so that the people of the city mock and scorn those idolater and take stomach unto they for these two victory thus happen begin now to make no reckon of they and will with all violence have run upon they to who their adversary make this answer tush you be not the man that have thus vanquish we but it be a certain fair lady all in white which with her admirable brightness have blindede we and a knight ride upon a white palfrey that have a red cross upon his breast and he it be that fight against we and turn we to flight which when the king understand he send to tell his brother that of those two the one be a virgin the mother of Christ who faith he have embrace and the other be s. james who both be send from God to succour and relieve he and that if he also will become a Christian they will likewise show great grace and favour unto he Mani-pango assault the Cittieon both side at once but Mani-pango will not accept of this message but all the night follow do put himself in a readiness to besiege the city upon both side at once the one with one part of his army at the straight above mention and the other with another part of his people himself in his own person compass about by the lane that ascend from the river and so in a place utter unprovided of either watch or ward he think to attempt the victory those that be above at the strait do first join battle and be quite discomfit and overthrow and himself hope to have thrust forward on the other side while his enemy be whole occupy in defend themselves at the strait find himself great deceive for his people be already put to flight by those of the city who perceive the great noise that and his troop make in ascend the hill on the other side run with all speed to meet with that danger and drive he and all his people back again put they in disarray and then so vex and molest they with such a fury of dart and other weapon which they throw among they that be overcome with fear and danger run away the stratagem of Mani-pango turn to his own destruction and fall into the snare and net which he himself have lay for the christian for light among the foresay stake he be with one of they thrust into the body and so be surprise with a evil death he finish his life as it be in a rage for you must understand that the sharp end of the say stake be envenom with a certain poison the death of Mani-pango which take hold of the blood and enter somewhat into the flesh will kill without all cure or remedy by this victory and death of his brother do the king remain in security and liberty wiihout all contradiction and then think with himself that his people and subject be in a great doubt and quandary and dare not for fear present themselves before he by reason of the error that they have commit against he like a good prince he send to signify unto they that he will pardon their former fault and receive they into his grace and favour whereupon they come and yield themselves unto he with all obedience the rebel yield to the king mercy all save the captain general who name be mani-bunda for he fear great to appear before the king for very shame of his disloyalty and villainy but yet at the last he obtain his pardon with a certain penance enjoin he that he shall go and serve in the build of the church whereupon he become afterwards so humble and devout a Christian that when the king will have ease he of that travel he will not by any mean give over his labour until such time as all the church be whole build and finish the kingdom be thus pacify and all thing well establish the king don Alfonso take order that they shall present go in hand with the fabric of the principal church the building of the church call saint cross call s. cross which be so name of the cross that be there plant as we tell you before and also because upon the feast day of the holy cross the first stone be lay in the foundation thereof moreover he command that the man shall bring stone and the woman shall fetch sand from the river for the further of this work the king will needs be the first porter himself and upon his own shoulder bring the first basket of stone which he cast into the foundation and the queen her basket of sand likewise thereby give a example to the lord and the lady of the court to do the like and to encourage and hearten the people in so holy a action and so this fabric be further by so good workmaster and workman in a very short time be full finish and therein be celebrate mass and other divine service with great solemnity beside a number of lord and other that be there baptize and christen so that the multitude of such as come to be partaker of the holy baptism abound so great that there be not priest enough to execute that office after this the king dispatch

Alfonso dispatch the Portugal ambassador and mother of his own into Portugal who till this time have remain at the court by reason of these trouble and with he he send also another ambassador of his own call don Roderigo and diverse other that be of kin both to himself and to his ambassador to the end that they shall learn both the doctrine of the christian in Portugal and also their language and

Diego very sumptuous as also in the ornament and furniture of his palace he be beside very courteous and liberal and will bestow large both upon his own subject and also upon the Portugal with great cost will he provide and buy such stuff as please he and will often say that rare thing shall not be in the hand of any but only of king he use to wear one suit of apparel but once or twice and then he will give it away to his follower whereupon the Portugal perceive that he do so great esteem cloth of gold and arras and such other costly household stuff they bring great store thereof out of Portugal so that at that time arras-hanging and cloth of gold and of silk and such like lordly furniture begin to be of great estimation in that kingdom in the time of this king there be a three bishop of saint Thomas and congo by nation a Portugal who with the usual ceremony be entertain both by the way the three b. of s. Thomas and of congo and also in the court at saint saviour and now the devil the common enemy of christian religion be much grieve with the happy success and promote of the catholic faith begin to sow his Darnell of division between the friar and priest dissension between the friar and priest and the new bishop and their new bishop which spring up and arise from the long liberty wherein they have now live so many year without a pastor so that every man esteem himself not only to be as good as the bishop but also to be a far better man than he be and therefore will yield no obedience to their prelate in such sort that there be raise among they so great a discord and dissension as it wrought a grievous scandal and wicked example among the people but the king like a good catholic and a faithful do always maintain the bishop part and to cut of these trouble and stir he send some of these priest to prison into Portugal and other into the isle of saint Thomas and some other go away with all their substance of their own accord and by these mean the doctrine of these minister in steed of increase do great diminish through their own default neither be our common adversary herewithal content but will needs proceed further by set discord between king and subject after the death of k. Diego three prince at once challenge the kingdom and all three slay for after the death of this king there start up three prince at once to challenge the succession the first be the king son who few of they favour because they desire to have another so that he be slay incontinent the two other that remain be of the blood royal one of they be create king by his favourite and follower with the good like of the great part of the people but utter against the mind of the Portugal and certain of the lord who aim and endeavour to set up the other insomuch as the foresay lord together with the Portugal go into the church to kill the king elect make this reckon with themselves that if they slay he the other must of necessity be make King but at that very self same time those of the contrary faction have slay the king that be already make by the Portugal persuade themselves assure that he be dead there will be no difficulty for they to obtain the state for their king because there be none other least that by law can challenge the sceptre royal and thus in a hour and in two several place be these two king murder at once in these conspiracy and slaughter when the people see the Portugal slay and disperse that there be no lawful person leave to enjoy the royal crown they lay all the blame upon the portugese who be the causer of all these mischief and thereupon they turn themselves against they and slay as many of they as they can find only they spare the priest and will not touch they nor any other that dwell in other place see therefore as before be say that there be none of the blood royal leave to be place in the government don Henrico create king they make choice of one don Henrico brother to don Diego the king decease and this Henrico go to war against the Anzichi leave behind he in his steed for governor under the title of king one don Alvaro a young man of twenty and five year of age son to his wife by another husband k.

shoulder a certain cape like a hood upon their bare skin they have a certain round garment like a rotchet which they call Incutto reach down to their knee make after the manner of a net but the stuff of it be very fine cloth of the say palm-tree and at the skirt there hang a number of thread-tassels that make a very gallant show these rotchet be turn up again and tuck upon their right shoulder that they may be the more at liberty on that hand upon that shoulder also they have the tail of a Zebra fasten with a handle which they use for a kind of bravery according to the most ancient custom of those part on their head they wear cap of yellow and red colour square above and very little so that they scarce cover the top of their head and wear rather for a pomp and a vanity then to keep they either from the air or from the sun the most part of they go unshodde but the king and some of the great lord do wear certain shoe of the old fashion such as be to be see in the ancient image of the roman and these be make also of the wood of the palm-tree the ancient apparel of the maan sort the poor sort and the common people be apparel from their middle downwards after the same manner but the cloth be courser and the rest of their body all naked the woman use three kind of traverse or as it be aprons beneath their girdlestead one be very long and reach to their heel the second short

apparel after that manner do keep their old custom the woman also go after the Portugal fashion save that they wear no cloak but upon their head they have certain veil and upon their veil black velvet cap garnish with jewel and chain of gold about their their neck but the poor sort keep the old fashion for only the lady of the court do bedeck themselves in such manner as we have tell you after the king himself be convert to the christian religion the court of congo now imitate the court of Portugal he conform his court in a certain sort after the manner of the king of Portugal and first for his service at the table when he dine or sup open in public there be a throne of estate erect with three step cover all over with indian tapestry and thereupon be place a table with a chair of crimzen velvet adorn with boss and nail of gold he always feed alone by himself neither do any man ever sit at his table but the prince stand about he with their head cover he have a cupboard of plate of gold and silver and one that take assay of his meat and drink he maintain a guard of the Anzichi and of other nation that keep about his palace furnish with such weapon as be above mention and when it please he to go abroad they sound their great instrument which may be hear about five or six mile and so signify that the king be go forth all his lord do accompany he and likewise the Portugal in who he repose a singular trust but very seldom it be that he go out of his palace twice in a week he give audience public yet no man speak unto he but his lord the custom and law of congo and because there be none that have any good or land of their own but all belong to the crown there be but few suit or quarrel among they save peradventure about some word they use no writing at all in the congo tongue in case criminal they proceed but slender for they do very hardly and seldom condemn any man to death if there be any riot or enormity commit against the portugese by the Moci-conghi for so be the inhabitant of the realm of congo call in their own language they be judge by the law of Portugal and if any mischief be find in any of they the king confine the malefactor into some desert island for he think it to be a great punishment to banish he in this sort to the end he may do penance for his sin then at one blow to execute he and if it so happen that those which be thus chastise do live ten or twelve year the king use to pardon they if they be of any consideration at all and do employ they in the service of the state as person that have be tame and well school and accustom to suffer any hardness in civil disagreement there be a order that if a Portugal have any suit against a Moci-Congo he go to the judge of congo but if a Moci-Congo do implead a Portugal he cite he before the consul or judge of the Portugal for the king have grant unto they one of their own nation to be judge in that country in their bargain between they and the Portugal they use no writing nor other instrument of bill or bond but dispatch their business only by word and witness they keep no history of their ancient king nor any memorial of the age past because they can write they measure their time general by the moon they know not the hour of the day nor of the night but they use to say in the time of such a man such a thing happen they reckon the distance of country not by mile or by any such measure but by the journey and travel of man that go from one place to another either load or unload touch their assemble together at feast their manner of assembly or other meeting of joy as for example when they be marry their instrument of music they sing verse and ballad of love and play upon certain lute that be make after a strange fashion for in the hollow part and in the neck they be somewhat like unto our lute but for the flat side where we use to carve a rose or a rundell to let the sound go inward that be make not of wood but of a skin as thin as a bladder and the string be make of hair which they draw out of the elephants tail and be very strong and bright and of certain thread make of the wood of palm-tree which from the bottom of the instrument do reach and ascend to the top of the handle and be tie every one of they to his several ring for towards the neck or handle of this lute there be certain ring place some high and some low whereat there hang diverse plate of iron and silver which be very thin and in bigness different one from another according to the proportion of the instrument these ring do make a sound of sundry tune according to the strike of the string for the string when they be strike do cause the ring to shake and then do the plate that hang at they help they to utter a certain mingle and confuse noise those that play upon this instrument do tune the string in good proportion and strike they with their finger like a harp but without any quill very cunning so that they make thereby I can tell whether I shall call it a melody or no but such a sound as please and delight their sense well enough beside all this which be a thing very admirable by this instrument they do utter they conceit of their mind and do understand one another so plain that every thing almost which may be explain with the tongue they can declare with their hand in touch and strike this instrument to the sound thereof they do dance in good measure with their foot and follow the just time of that music with clap the palm of their hand one against the other they have also in the court flute and pipe which they sound very artificial and according to the sound they dance and move their foot as it be in a moresco with great gravity and sobriety the common people do use little rattle and pipe and other instrument that make a more harsh and rude sound than the court-instrument do in this kingdom their physic when any be sick they take nothing but natural physic as herb and tree and the bark of tree and oil and water and stone such as mother nature have teach they the ague be the most common disease that reign among they and plague they in winter by reason of the continual rain that bring heat and moisture with it more than in summer and beside that the sickness which here we call the french disease and Chitangas in the congo tongue be not there so dangerous and so hard to be cure as it be in our country they heal the ague with the powder of a wood their medicine for a ague call Sandale or Saunders whereof there be both red and gray which be the wood of aguila this powder be mingle with the oil of the palm-tree and have anoint the body of the sick person two or three time withal from the head to the foot their medicine for the headache and other grief of the body be let of blood the party recover when their head ache they let blood in the temple with certain little box horn first by cut the skin a little and then apply the cornet thereunto which with a suck of the mouth will be fill with blood and this manner of let blood be use also in Egypt and so in any other part of a man body where there be any grief their medicine for the french pock they draw blood in this fashion and heal it likewise they cure the infirmity call Chitangas with the same unction of Saunders whereof there be two sort one red as we tell you and that be call Tavila the other gray and be call Chicongo and this be best esteem for they will not stick to give or sell a slave for a piece of it their purgation they purge themselves with certain bark of tree make into powder and take in some drink and they will work mighty and strong when they take these purgation they make no great account for go abroad into the air cure of wound their wound also they common cure with the juice of certain herb and with the herb themselves and the say signior odoardo have affirm unto i that he see a slave which be stab through with seven mortal wound of a arrow and be recover whole and sound only with the juice of certain herb well know unto they by experience so that this people be not encumber with a number of physician for surgery for drug for syrup for electuary for plaster and such like medicine but simple do heal and cure themselves with such natural plant as grow in their own country whereof they have no great need neither for live as they do under a temperate climate and not ingorge themselves with much variety of meat to please their appetite nor surcharge their stomach with wine they be not great trouble with those disease that common be engender of meat and drink that remain undigested chap. 8. of the country that be beyond the kingdom of congo towards the cape of good-hope and of the river Nilus now that we have see the kingdom of congo and the condition both of the country and people that dwell therein and also of the nation thereunto adjoin it remain that we discourse a little further and that with all brevity of the rest of Africa towards the cape of good-hope all along the ocean whereby they use to sail into India even as far as the red sea and then we will return back again into the inland and treat of the river Nilus and of preti-gianni and of all his kingdom to the end that so far as our matter will bear we may make a perfect relation of those region which hitherto have not so well and so right be conceive of every man beyond the kingdom of congo we have signify unto you that there be other country belong to the king of angola and beyond that towards the cape of good-hope the kingdom of Matama a king call Matama who rule over diverse province which be call Quimbebe this realm as we tell you from the first lake and the confine of angola contain all the rest of the country southwards till you come to the river of Bravagul r. Bravagul r. Magnice the mountain of the moon which spring out of the mountain of the moon and join with the river Magnice and that spring out of the foresay first lake these mountain be divide by the tropic of Capricorn towards the pole antarctike and beyond this tropic lie all the country and border of the cape of good-hope which be not rule and govern by any one king but by diverse and sundry several prince in the midst between that cape and the tropic be the say mountain of the moon so famous and so great renown among the ancient writer who do assign they to be the original head and spring of the river Nilus which be very false and untrue as the situation of the country do plain show and as we a little hereafter will discover unto you this country be full of high and rough mountain it be very can and not habitable it be frequent and haunt with a few person that live after the manner of the arabian under little cabin in the open field and apparel with the skin of certain beast it be a savage and a rustical nation without all faith and credit neither will they suffer any stranger among they their furniture be bow and arrow they feed upon such fruit as the land breed and also upon the flesh of beast among these mountain of the moon there be a lake call gale the lake Gale a very little one it be and lie somewhat towards the west out of this lake there issue a river call Camissa Camissa 1 the sweet river and by the Portugal name the sweet river which at the point of the cape of good-hope void itself into the sea in that very place that be term the false cape the false cape for the ship of the indies sail that way do first discover another great cape which be call the cape of the needle and then afterwards this lesser cape the cape of the needle whereupon they call it the false cape because it be hide and cover with the true and great cape between these two cape or promontory there be the distance of a hundred mile contain the largeness and breadth of this famous cape which be divide into two point as it be into two horn it make a gulf where sometime the Portugal ship do take fresh water in the river that they call the sweet river the inhabitant of this coast which dwell between these two point another note that the colour of black in man skin do not proceed from the heat of the sun be of colour black although the pole antarctike in that place be in the elevation of thirty and five degree which be a very strange thing yea the rude people that live among the most cold mountain of the moon be black also this I write of purpose to advise and move the philosopher and such as search the effect of nature that they will fall into their deep contemplation and speculation and thereupon teach we whether this black colour be occasion by the sun or by any other secret and unknown cause which question I for this time do mean to leave undecided now forasmuch as this promontory of good-hope be the great cape of all the cape of good-hope very dangerous and stretch out into the sea far than any other in the whole universal world and be very dangerous to pass as all promontory be and for that also the sea be there most terrible and from the land there blow most horrible wind which cause that ocean to be exceed tempestuous and stormy so that many Portugal ship of admirable burden have be cast away therein and last because the ancient historiographer do never know it no not so much as by hearsay and it be not long ago since the king of Portugal fleet do first discover the same it shall not be impertinent but rather a matter of great convenience in this place to decipher the measure thereof and to make so manifest a declaration of it as may serve also to understand how great the navigation be from Portugal into India by compass the coast of the cape of good-hope only almost the space of six thousand mile as a little hereafter it shall be show unto you for from the river of Ferdinando Poo where the say cape begin to jut-out into the sea this be a point of the cape of good-hope as far as to the point which we call the point of needle there be contain upon the shore more than two thousand and 200. mile from the north to the south and on the contrary side from the say point to the cape of guarda-fuy right over against the island of Socotora they reckon more than three thousand and three hundred mile by the coast from the south to the north. so that from Lisbon compass about the shore of Africa and all the cape of good-hope unto the kingdom of goa there be more than fifteen thousand mile and from thence afterwards to malaca and to China and so forward there remain so long a journey that never yet in any time hitherto have there be so great and so dangerous a navigation undertake and perform as this of the Portugal neither with great vessel nor with small why it be call the cape of good-hope it be call the cape of good-hope because all such as sail that way aswell in go forth as in return home do especial and principal aim at this mark that they may pass and get beyond this promontory which when they have do they account themselves to be out of all danger and as it be to have perform their journey and upon this their general desire they give it the name of the cape of good-hope now to return to our purpose and to talk further of the coast of Africa beyond the cape or point of the needle there be many competent harbour and haven Seno Formoso Seno Lago the principal whereof be Seno Formoso the fair bay and Seno Lago the bay of the lake for there the sea make a certain gulf wherein be sundry island and port and somewhat beyond there run into the sea the river of s. Christopher river of saint Christopher and at the mouth thereof there lie three pretty islet a little further forward the coast run all along by a country do nadal which the Portugal call Terra do Natal the land of the nativity because it be first discover at Christmas Capo Pescheria and so reach to the cape call della Pescheria between which cape and the river Magnice r. Magnice the kingdom of Buttua within the land be the kingdom of Buttua who territory be from the root or bottom of the mountain of the moon until you come to the river Magnice towards the north the kingdom of Monomotapa r. Bravagul where the country of Monomotapa stand and westward from the river Bravagul towards the sea all along the bank of the river Magnice store of gold mine in this kingdom there be many mine of gold and a people that be of the same quality and condition that the people of Monomotapa be as hereafter shall be show unto you and so go along the shore of the ocean you come to the river Magnice which lie in the very entrance of the kingdom of Sofala and the empire of Monomotapa chap. 9 of the kingdom of Sofala this kingdom begin at the river Magnice which spring out of the first lake of Nilus the original of the river Magnice and convey itself into the sea in the midst of the bay between the point Pescheria and the cape call Capo Correnti situate in twenty and three degree and a half of the pole antarctik under the tropic of Capricorn with this river near unto the sea three river run into Magnice there join three other notable river the principal whereof be by the Portugal call saint Christopher because upon the day of that saint feast it be first discover 1. r. Nagoa but by the inhabitant it be name Nagoa 2. r. Margues the second take the name of one Lorenzo Margues that first find it these two river do spring original from the mountain of the moon so great renown among the ancient writer but by the people of the country they be call Toroa out of which mountain they do think that famous Nilus take also his beginning but they be utter deceive for as we have already tell you the first lake arise not out of those mountain Nilus arise not out of the mountain of the moon but lie a great way distant from it and between it and they be there a very great and a huge low plain beside that the stream that flow from the say mountain do run towards the east and bestow their water upon other great river so that it be not possible for they to pass into the foresay lake much less into Nilus consider especial that the river Magnice spring out of that first lake and by a far different course from the course of Nilus run towards the east and so join itself with the two river aforesaid 3. r. arroe the three be call arroe and arise on another side out of the mountain of the gold-mine of Monomotapa and in some place of this river there be find some small piece of gold among the sand these three river enter into the great Magnice near unto the sea and all four together do make there a great water in a very large channel and so discharge itself into the ocean from the mouth of this river all along the sea coast the r. of Cuama stretch the kingdom of Sofala unto the river Cuama which be so call of a certain castle or fortress that carry the same name and be possess by mahometan and pagan but the Portugal call it the mouth of Cuama because at the entry into the sea this river divide itself into seven mouth where there be five special island beside diverse other that lie up the river all very full and well people with pagan this Cuama come out of the same lake and from the same spring from whence Nilus flow and thus the kingdom of Sofala be comprise within the say two river Magnice and Cuama upon the sea coast the kingdom of Sofala it be but a small kingdom and have but few house or town in it the chief and principal head whereof be a island that lie in the river call Sofala which give the name to all the whole country it be inhabit by mahometan and the king himself be of the same sect and yield obedience to the crown of Portugal because he will not be subject to the empire of Monomotapa and thereupon the Portugal there do keep a fort in the mouth of the river Cuama and do trade in those country for gold and ivory and amber which be find upon that coast the commodity of Sofala gold ivory and amber and good store of slave and in steed thereof they leave behind they cotton-cloth and silk that be bring from Cambaia and be the common apparel of those people the inhabitant of Sofala the mahometan that at this present do inhabit those country be not natural bear there but before the portugese come into those quarter they traffic thither in small bark from the coast of Arabia foelix and when the Portugal have conquer that realm the mahometan stay there still and now they be become neither utter pagan nor hold of the sect of Mahomet from the shore and coast that lie between the two foresay river of Magnice and Cuama the empire of Monomotapa full of gold-mine within the land spread the empire of Monomotapa where there be very great store of mine of gold which be carry from thence into all the region thereabouts and into Sofala and into the other part of Africa and some there be that will say that salomon gold salomon Gold which he have for the temple of jerusalem be bring by sea out of these country a thing in truth not very unlikely for in the country of Monomotapa there do remain to this day many ancient building of great work and singular architecture of stone of lime and of timber the like whereof be not to be see in all the province adjoin the empire of Monomotapa be very great and for people infinite the people of Monomotapa they be gentile and pagan of colour black very courageous in war of a middle stature and swift of foot there be many king that be vassal and subject to Monomotapa who do oftentimes rebel and make war against he their weapon be bow and arrow and light dart this emperor maintain many army in several province the k. of Monomotapa maintain many army divide into legion according to the use and custom of the roman for be so great a lord as he be he must of necessity be in continual war for the maintenance of his estate and among all the rest of his soldier the most valorous in name be his legion of woman who he esteem very high and account they as the very sinew and strength of his military force these woman do burn their left pap with fire left-handed amazon because they shall be no hindrance unto they in their shoot after the use and manner of the ancient amazon that be so great celebrate by the historiographer of former profane memory for their weapon they practise bow and arrow they be very quick and swift lively and courageous very cunning in shoot but especial and above all venturous and constant in fight in their battle they use a warlike kind of craft and subtlety for they have a custom to make a show that they will fly and run away as though they be vanquish and discomfit but they will diverse time turn themselves back and vex their enemy mighty with the shot of their arrow and when they see their adversary so greedy of the victory that they begin to disperse and scatter themselves then will they sudden turn again upon they and with great courage and fierceness make a cruel slaughter of they so that partly with their swiftness and partly with their deceitful wile and other cunning shift of war they be great fear in all those part they do enjoy by the king good favour certain country where they dwell alone by themselves and sometime they choose certain man at their own pleasure with who they do keep company for generation sake so that if they do bring forth male-children they send they home to their father house but if they be female they reserve they to themselves and breed they in the exercise of warfare the empire of this Monomotapa lie as it be in a island the situation of the empire of Monomotapa which be make by the sea-coast by the river Magnice by a piece of the lake from whence Magnice flow and by the river Cuama it border towards the south upon the lord of the cape of good-hope before mention and northward upon the empire of Moenemugi as by and by shall be show unto you but now return to our former purpose that be to say the kingdom of Angoscia to run forward upon the sea-coast after you have pass over some part of the river Cuama there be a certain little kingdom upon the sea call Angoscia which take the name of certain island there so call and lie direct against it it be inhabit with the like people both mahometan and gentile as the kingdom of Sofala be merchant they be and in small vessel do traffic along that coast with the same ware and commodity wherewith the people of Sofala do trade a little beyond the kingdom of mozambique sudden start up in sight the kingdom of mozambique situate in fourteen degree and a half towards the south and take his name of three island r. meghincate that lie in the mouth of the river Meghincate where there be a great haven and a safe and able to receive all manner of ship the realm be but small and yet abound in all kind of victual it be the common land place for all vessel that sail from Portugal and from India into that country in one of these isle which be the chief and principal call mozambique and give name to all the rest as also to the whole kingdom the island of mozambique and the haven aforesaid wherein there be erect a fortress guard with a garrison of Portugal whereupon all the other fortress that be on that coast do depend and from whence they fetch all their provision all the armada and fleet that sail from Portugal to the indies if they can finish and perform their voyage will go and winter I say in this island of mozambique and those that travel out of India to Europe be constrain of necessity to touch at mozambique to furnish themselves with victual this island when the Portugal discover India be the first place where they learn the language of the indian and provide themselves of pilot to direct they in their course the inhabitant of mozambique the people of this kingdom be gentile rustical and rude they be and of colour black they go all naked they be valiant and strong archer and cunning fisher with all kind of hook as you go on forward upon the foresay coast there be another island call Quiloa the kingdom of Quiloa in quantity not great but in excellency singular for it be situate in a very cool and fresh air it be replenish with tree that be always green and afford all variety of victual it lie at the mouth of the river Coavo which spring out of the same lake from whence Nilus flow and so run about sixty mile in length till it come near to the sea and there it have a mighty stream and in the very mouth of it make a great island which be people with mahometan and idolater and a little beyond that towards the coast on the west you may see the say island of Quiloa this island be inhabit with mahometan also the island of Quiloa and the inhabitant thereof which be of colour something whitish they be well apparel and trim adorn with cloth of silk and cotton their woman do use ornament of gold and jewel about their hand and their neck and have good store of household stuff make of silver they be not altogether so black as the man be and in their limb they be very well proportion their house be make of stone and lime and timber very well wrought and of good architecture with garden and orchard full of herb and sundry fruit of this island the whole kingdom take the name which upon the coast extend itself from Capo delgado the cape delicate that border mozambique and Quiloa and be situate in nine degree towards the south and from thence it run out unto the aforesaid river of Coavo in old time the kingdom of Quiloa be the chief of all the principality there adjoin and stand near to the sea but when the Portugal arrive in those country the king trust so much to himself that he think he be able with his own force not only to defend himself against they but also to drive they from those place which they have already surprise the king of Quiloa overthrow by the portugese and drive out of the island howbeit the matter fall out quite contrary for when it come to weapon he be utter overthrow and discomfit by the portugese and so flee away but they take and possess the island and enrich themselves with the great spoil and booty that they find therein they erect there also a fortress which be afterward pull down by the commandment of the king of Portugal because he think it not necessary consider that there be other sufficient enough for that coast. and here we may not leave behind we the isle of s. Laurence the commendation of the isle of s. Laurence so call by the Portugal because they do first discover it upon that martyr feast day it be so great Historia China part. 3. cap. ' Isola s Lorenzo 275. leghe and 90. that it contain in length almost a thousand mile and stand right over against the coast which we have describe begin direct at the mouth of the river Magnice which be in twenty and six degree of the south and so go forward to the north it end right against the mouth of Cuama in the kingdom of Quiloa the great island of s. Laurence be in length 275. league and in breadth 90. league the last chapter of the history of the kingdom of China print in Macao the first latin book that ever be print in China make mention of this island by the name of Madagascar in these word Madagascar Madagascar contain almost 300. league between this island and the firm land there be as it be a channel which at the entry westward be three hundred and forty mile broad in the midst where it be narrow over against the island of Mozambiche a hundred and seventy mile and for the rest it enlarge itself very much towards India and contain many isle within it the ship that go from Spain into India or return from India to Spain do always for the most part pass and sail in and through this channel if by time or weather they be not force to the contrary and sure this island deserve to be inhabit with a better people because it be furnish with singular commodity for it have many safe and sure haven it be water with sundry river that cause the earth to bring forth fruit of diverse kind as pulse and rice and other grain orange lemon citron and such like fruit flesh of all sort as hen etc. and venison as wild boar and deer and such

other they go coast along the shore with certain bark that be make but of one stock of a tree which they hollow for that purpose the most part of they do not willing entertain stranger neither will they consent that they shall traffic or converse with they notwithstanding in certain port the Portugal do use to trade with the islander for amber sundry island in the channel wax silver copper rise

Christopher and then of santo Spirito and another call magliaglie and so the rest as the isle of Comoro the kingdom of Mombaza rich in gold and silver and pearl Anzoame Maiotto and some other but let we return to the sea side and prosecute the coast of the kingdom of Quiloa where we leave next unto it be the kingdom of Mombaza in the height of three degree and a half towards the south which take the name from a island inhabit with mahometan which be also call Mombaza where there be a fair city with house that have many sollar furnish with picture both grave and paint the king thereof be a

with pagan and mahometan and yield obedience to the empire of Mohenemugi a little beyond the kingdom of Melinde be the kingdom of Melinde which be likewise but a little one extend itself upon the sea coast as far as the river Chimanchi and lie in the height of two degree and a half and up the stream of that river it reach to the lake Calais the space of a hundred mile within land near unto the sea along the bank of this river there be a great deal of country inhabit by pagan and mahometan the tail of a sheep in Melinde weigh common 25. or 30. pound of colour almost white their house be build after our fashion but there be one particularity to be admire that their mutton or sheep be twice as great as the sheep of our country for they divide they into five quarter Aser affirm that he have see tail of egyptian sheep that weigh 50. l. a piece and sometime 120. l. a piece if a man may so call they and reckon the tail for one which common weigh some twenty and five or thirty pound the

house the woman and inhabitant of Melinde they cover themselves with taffeta so that they be not know but when they listen themselves in this country there be a very good haven which be a land place for the vessel that sail through those sea general the people be very kind true and trusty and converse with stranger they have always entertain and welcome the portugese and have repose great confidence in they neither have they ever offer they any wrong in any respect in the sea between these two cape of Mombaza three isle 1. monsie 2. zanzibar 3 Pemba and Melinde there be three isle the first be call monsie the second zanzibar and the three Pemba all inhabit only with mahometan that be of colour white these isle abound in all thing as the other do whereof we make mention before these people be somewhat incline to arm but they be in deed more addict to dress and manure their ground for there grow much sugar which in small bark they carry away to sell into the firm land with other fruit of that country beside these three realm last describe Quiloa Melinde and Mombaza within the land be the great empire of Moenemugi towards the west it border upon the south the empire of Mohenemugi with the kingdom of mozambique and with the empire of Monomotapa to the river Coavo upon the west with the river Nilus between the two lake and upon the north it join with the empire of Prete Gianni towards the sea this emperor stand in good term of peace with the foresay king of Quiloa Melinde and Mombaza by reason of their traffic together and the better to secure the intercourse and trade by sea by mean whereof they have bring unto they much cloth of Cotton and cloth of silk from diverse country and other merchandise that be well esteem in these part and particular certain little ball that be make in the kingdom of Cambaia of a kind of bitumen or clammy clay like unto glass but that it be as it be of a red colour which they use to wear about their neck like a pair of bead in steed of necklace it serve they also in steed of money for of gold they make none account likewise with the silk that be bring unto they they do apparel themselves from the girdle downwards in exchange and barter of all these commodity they give gold silver copper and ivory but on the other side towards Monomotapa there be continual war yea and sometime so bloody that it be hardly discern who have get the victory for in that border there meet together two of the great and most warlike power and force that be in all those region that be to say on the party of Monomotapa there come forth into the field the amazon of who we tell you before and on the party of Mohenemugi be the Giacchi as the Moci-conghi do call they but in their own tongue they be call Agagi the Giaechas or Agagi who do sometime so great afflict the kingdom of congo as you may remember neither be these people less courageous or strong than the amazon but be of a black complexion and presumptuous countenance they do use to mark themselves above the lip upon their cheek with certain line which they make with iron instrument and with fire moreover they have a custom to turn their eye lid backward so that their skin be all black and in that blackness show the white of their eye and those mark in their face it be a strange thing to behold they for it be in deed a very dreadful and devilish sight they be of body great but deform and live like beast in the field and feed upon man flesh in fight they show themselves exceed courageous and do utter most horrible shout and cry of purpose to daunt and affray their enemy their weapon be dart and pavise of leather that cover all their whole body and so defend themselves therewith sometime they will encamp together and stick their pavise in the ground which be unto they in steed of a trench sometime they will go forward in the battle and shroud themselves under they and yet annoy their adversary with the shot of their dart and thus by warlike policy they do ordinary plague their enemy by endeavour with all subtlety to make they spend their shot in vain upon their target and when they see that they have make a end of shoot then do they renew the battle a fresh and drive they to flight make a cruel slaughter of they without all mercy and this be the manner which they use against their enemy the amazon and the amazon but the amazon on the other side which be very well acquaint herewithal do fight against they with other military stratagem as we have above declare and do overcome the force of their adversary with their swiftness and great skill in matter of war for they do assure themselves that if they be take they shall be devour and therefore with double courage they fight for life that they may overcome and in any case save their life from that fierce and cruel nation and in this sort do they maintain continual war always with great mortality on both side these agag dwell at the begin of the river Nilus where it run northwards out of the lake upon both the bank of the river till it come to a certain limit wherein they be bound and then westward all over the bank of the say Nilus even to the second lake and to the border of the empire of prete-gianni touch these agag I think it convenient in this place to add all this which before I have omit between the confine of this and prete-gianni there be sundry other petty lord and people that be of a white colour and yield obedience sometime to one of these two prince and sometime to the other they be man of a far great stature than all the rest of the people in those country chap. 10. the rest of the coast of the ocean to the red Sea of the empire of Prete Gianni and the confine thereof of the famous river Nilus and the original spring thereof and now to return to our former treatise of the coast beyond the realm of Melinde towards the cape of guarda-fuy there be many place inhabit with mahometan all along the sea side of colour be white upon this shore there be diverse good haven many good haven where the ship of sundry country do traffic with the foresay merchandise the first of these place be call Patee the second Brava the three the four affion the cape of Fuy and the last be the famous promontory and cape of guarda-fuy which because it be very great and jut out a good way into the sea be well know to all sailor that come from India and from Ormuz and from Arabia it be the place and harbour where the Portugal be wont to attend and yearly with their navy to watch for the vessel of the mahometan that be lade with precious merchandise do sail into those part without their licence they be the lord of the traffic and trade for spicery and all other commodity that be bring from India so that every year the Portugal fleet do take great prize of merchant ship in that place as the english and the french do at cape saint Vincent after you have compass about the foresay cape of guarda-fuy diverse port on the sea coast towards the red Sea toward the red sea you shall come to other town and haven of the mahometan the first of they be call Methe and another beyond that call Barbora and this be the further place wherein you shall find any people with white skin for here the man begin to be all black then there be Ceila and Dalaca and malaca and Carachin and all this coast be call in that country language the people that inhabit therein be all black valiant in arm and apparel from the girdle downward with cloth of Cotton but those that be of the best account among they do wear upon their shoulder certain cloak with hood call Bernussi such as the old roman use and be term it abound in gold and in ivory and in metal and in victual of all sort then follow the mouth or entrance into the red gulf the red Sea otherwise call the red sea well know to every man in number they be two cause by a island that lie between they and be call Babelmandel the one of they towards the west be fifteen mile broad the two entrance into the red sea and have a deep channel and through this do all the great ship enter the other be a little one and contain in breadth but five mile and yet be full of shallows and shelf of sand and some rock so that the whole mouth be but thirty mile in all the one cape on the side of Africa be call Rosbel and the other towards Arabia foelix be ara. from this place all the western coast of the say gulf run up to suez the length of the red sea 1200 mile which be the far town thereof northwards and be distant from these mouth twelve hundred mile all this gulf both on the one side and on the other near to the bank be much pester with Islettes and shelf that be very shallow and afford free and safe navigation but only in the midst for the sea follow the motion and stream of the ocean with great swiftness do keep the channel and the bottom in the middle very clean and neat by cast up the filth and sand upon the bank on both side and now forasmuch as we be to speak of the empire of Prete Gianni the empire of Prete Gianni who be the great and the rich prince in all Africa let we tell you in brief that his state and government at this day reach from the two mouth of the red sea unto the island of Syene which be under the tropic of cancer except the coast of the say sea for about fifty year ago he lose they by negligence and suffer the Turk to take they from he so that the confine of his estate be these viz. towards the north-east and the east the great part of the red sea towards the north Egypt towards the west the desert of Nubia and towards the south the country of Mohenemugi and so in a gross and general account the empire of this christian king may happy be in compass some four thousand mile the principal city where he most remain and keep his court bel-malechi his chief city be call bel-malechi he rule over many province that have their several king he be very rich his estate be very rich and abound in gold in silver in precious stone and in all sort of metal his people be of diverse colour as white black and a middle colour between both they be of a very good stature and have good countenance his courtier and lord be apparel with cloth of silk and adorn with gold and sundry jewel there be among they a law for apparel a law for apparel according to the several degree of man for certain person there be for who it be not lawful to wear any other garment but such as be make of dress skin these people be in a manner christian his people be christian for they do observe certain ceremony of the law of the hebrew a great solemnity upon the feast of the assumption of our lady upon the feast day of our lady in August all the king and principal lord assemble themselves together in the city aforesaid to celebrate that feast every man bring with he his tribute that he owe to the king and the people come from all part in pilgrimage to perform this their devotion they have a very solemn procession and out of the church from whence they walk they carry with they a image of the bless virgin the mother of God which be as big as any common person and all of Gold this image have for the eye two very rich and great ruby all the rest of the body be garnish and adorn with jewel and curious work and it be carry upon a frame make of gold of a wonderful and admirable workmanship in this procession also there come abroad in public show Prete Gianni himself either upon a chariot of gold or else upon a elephant all garnish and trim with jewel and such rare and precious thing and cover all over with cloth of gold the multitude of people that run to see this image be so great that many be stifle in the press and die thereupon this king be call by a corrupt term Prete the right name of Prete Gianni for the right name be Bel-Gian now Bel signify that which be chief perfect and excellent in anything and gian be a prince or a lord and be apply to every man that have a government and jurisdiction and therefore belgian be asmuch to say as the chief prince and be so join together in one word it appertain to the king alone and to no man else he bear also the surname of David as the emperor of Rome do use the name of Caesar now it remain that we do discourse of the river Nilus the river Nilus which do not spring in the country of Bel-Gian much less out of the mountain of the moon nor as Ptolemy write out of the two lake Ptolemie disprove which he set down in parallel from the east to the west with a distance of about four hundred and fifty mile between they for in the altitude of the same pole wherein the say author place those two lake lie also the kingdom of congo and of angola towards the west and and on the other side eastward be the empire of Monomotapa and the kingdom of Sofala with a distance from sea to sea of twelve hundred mile now within all this space as signior odoardo affirm unto i there be but one only lake to be find which lie in the confine of angola and Monomotapa and contain in diameter a hundred ninety and five mile of the western side of this lake the people of angola do give sufficient information and of the other side eastward those of Sofala and Monomotapa so that there be a full and perfect knowledge of this one lake but of any other thereabouts there be no mention at all make and therefore it may well be conclude that there be none other to be find in that altitude of degree true it be in deed that there be two lake but they be situate in place quite contrary to that which Ptolemie write for he as it have be tell you place his parallel from west to east but these be situate from the south to the north as it be in a direct line with the distance of about four thousand mile between they some that dwell in those country do hold a opinion Nilus do not hide himself under the ground and then arise again as some say that Nilus after it be issue out of the first lake hide itself under the ground and afterwards rise again but other do deny that it be so signior odoardo do justify it to i that the true history and certainty of this matter be that Nilus do not hide itself under the ground but that it run through monstrous and desert valley without any settle channel and where no people inhabit the true spring of Nilus be out of the first lake and so they say it sink into the bottom of the earth from this first lake in deed do Nilus spring which lie in twelve degree towards the pole antarctike and be compass about like a vault with exceed high mountain the great whereof be call Cafates upon the east the second lake and the hill of sal-nitrum and the hill of silver on another side and last with diverse other mountain on the three part this river Nilus run for the space of 400. mile direct towards the north and then enter into another very great lake which the inhabitant do call a Sea it be much big than the first for it contain in breadth two hundred and twenty mile and lie under the line equinoctial of this second lake the Anzichi who be near neighbour to congo do give very certain and perfect information for they traffic into those part the people that dwell about the second lake and they report that in this lake there be a people that sail in great ship and can write and use number and weight and measure which they have not in the part of congo that they build their house with stone and lime and that for their fashion and quality they may be compare with the Portugal whereupon it may be well gather that the empire of prete-gianni can be far from thence from this second lake the river Nilus run forward to the island of Meroe the island of Meroe for the space of seven hundred mile and receive into it sundry other river the r. Coluez the principal of they all be the river so call because it issue out of a lake of the same name and situate in the border of Melinde after that Nilus be come to Meroe it divide itself into two branch and so compass about a good high territory which be call Meroe upon the right hand whereof towards the east there run a river name Abagni the r. Abagni that spring out of the lake and cross over the empire of Prete Gianni till you come to the say island and on the other side westward there be diverse other river the r. Saraboe among which Saraboe be one when Nilus have thus receive these river into it and have compass the island with both his arm he wax great than he be before and meet again in one channel and by Aethiopia which be call Aethiopia above Egypt run to the fall as they call they which lie in a very low valley that be very narrow and straight and shut the river within a very little channel the isle of Syene so that it fall from aloft downward with a most horrible noise near to the isle of Syene and from thence water all Egypt it disgorge his stream into the mediterranean sea the two branch of Nilus fall into the mediterranean sea which lie direct over against the island of Cyprus by two of his principal branch the one call at this day the mouth of Damiata on the east and the other the mouth of Rossetto on the west and forasmuch as we be now come to the very end of this discourse concern Nilus it will be very convenient the cause of the increase of Nilus that we touch in brief the occasion of his increase as we have tell you before the principal cause of the increase of Nilus be the great quantity of water that rain from heaven at such time as the spring begin here in these country but there with they in winter which may be to speak general about the begin of April this water fall not as the water fall in these region of Europe but it fall most abundant and come down not in small drop like our rain but be pour down as it be with pail and bucket so that because it fall with so great violence and in so great a quantity the earth can suck it up nor drink it in for the ground be ragged and somewhat bend downward the water scour away with a exceed fury and run into the river cause they to swell and to rise in a marvelous manner and so overflow the country you must herewithal consider especial that they have these continual rain for the space of five whole moon together that be to say in April May june july and August but principal in May june and july for then be the water in their great pride and hereupon it come to pass that the country be full of mountain and very high hill as have be tell you and consequent replenish with diverse brook and rillet and lake they all join and meet together in the channel of the great river do make they so great and so large that they contain and carry more water than all the river of the universal world and the lake grow to such a excessive compass and wideness that it be a wonder as may be see in the discourse touch the cape of good-hope and all these kingdom of congo and the country there adjoin where there be lake of so extraordinary a bigness that in the language of those region they be not call lake but sea and thus you see how the river Nilus in the time and season before mention the several course of sundry great river on the one side do run most furious from those country into the north to water Egypt and the river Zaire and the river Nigir on the other side westward and eastward and towards the south other huge and monstrous river which at certain determine and limit time do never fail to increase as Nilus do and this be the effect of they which be ordinary see every year especial in cairo and over all Egypt where Nilus begin to rise about the end of june and continue his rise till the twentieth of September as I have see myself but the occasion and cause of this increase have be until this present time very secret and obscure (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) 1. the river that fall from head hom. Odis 4. and although the ancient writer begin even at Homer have after a sort and in general term leave in writing that Nilus do increase by rain yet have they not so distinct and plain discourse thereof as signior odoardo have do and testify the same by his own view and knowledge for some there be that have assign the cause of this overflow to be the rain that come from the mountain of the moon other have attribute it to the snow that be melt in those mountain and yet Nilus do not swell or rise any thing near to the mountain of the moon but a great way from they towards the north and beside that the season of winter do rather breed snow then yield any heat to melt it and now that I have with good diligence inquire of signior odoardo these matter above write the conclusion of this book upon such point as I have before plot to myself and he also propound the rest unto i of his own mere motion like a man of high conceit as in truth he be and satisfy i with such answer as be set down in this discourse yet I do assure myself that every man will not rest full content and satisfy herewith especial such as be curious and practise in matter of the world and skilful in the science the geographer will peradventure desire to understand more and the physician and the master of mineral and the historiographer and the merchant and the mariner and the preacher and some other that be different from these in respect of their profession but signior odoardo have promise with as much speed as possible he may to return to Rome from congo whether he sail present after he have finish this treatise which be in may 1589. with very ample information and further instruction for the supply of that which here want touch Nilus and his original and such other matter in the mean time that little which be contain in these few leaf be not very little but yet if perhaps there be any thing find therein that may be either profitable or strange or delightful or fit to pass away the time and to drive away melancholy let it be whole ascribe to the right noble and reverend father my lord Antony Migliore bishop of San Marco and commendador of santo Spirito who be the author of this work to be publish for the common benefit
