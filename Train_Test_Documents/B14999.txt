a true and tragical discourse show the most lamentable misery and distress calamity endure by 67. english man which be send for a supply to the plant in Guiana in the year 1605. to make a long and tedious discourse of that which may be utter in few word expe^^ce teach do rather move a loathe in the reader than any way procure a like either in reader or hearer in which respect I have rather desire brief to deliver a plain truth which of itself to the wise and discreet be ever most acceptable then with file phrase or eloquent term which indeed in i be want to add any thing more than be most true neither to represent or lay open to the view of the world aught more than what myself with my associate have have as woeful experience as ever in my judgement have any creature live under the canopy of heaven only thus much I think it not impertinent to deliver for the better explanation of that which follow I make no question but that the great sort of people which either have travail themselves have conversation with travailer or employ themselves to much read be not ignorant that in the main of America in that part thereof which be vulgar call the west India among many other large territory and dominion be the great and mighty kingdom of Guiana situate near about the middle of the say continent or somewhat more southerly it be near under that equinoctial line the souther most part thereof and extend itself to about some 5. or 6. degree of north latitude be border on the south-west with Perue on the south with Amazonis on the north with Mexico and on the east with the ocean Sea the say country of Guiana be first discover or make know to our english nation as far as I can learn about the year of our lord 1594. at the charge and direction principal of sir Walter Raleigh the same again second by himself the year follow afterward again by captain keymish and oth^^^ at the charge of the say sir Walter Raleigh it be repute to be the chief place for gold mine in all the west India but the prosecution thereof be leave off for a time by what occasion I know not it so happen that in the year of our lord 1602 captain Charles Leigh make a voyage thither for the discovery thereof and find a fit place for habitation determine to procure the plant of a colony there in the river which say determination at his return be put in practice with the furtherance and special charge of the worshipful knight sir olive Leigh certain man be send thither there to inhabit under the conduct of the aforesaid captain Charles Leigh who remain there about a year and a half where he with many of his company die for a supply unto which company be another company send in the year 1605. at the charge of the say sir olive Leigh and certain other adventurer of which company myself be one all under the conduct and lead of captain sen-iohn who be embark in the olive branch of sir olive Leigh whereof be captain and master under God captain catlin and Arthur chamber be thus ready do set sail the twelve of April one thousand six hundred and five nothing happen worth note till we come as high as the north cape where a english bark overtake we four of our gentleman by reason of their sickness be desirous to return home again so that get their passage for Lisbon they take their leave of we who name be master Rogers master catlin master sanders and another who name I do not now remember so we continue our course to the canary and so to cape Blancko in Barbary and from thence to the i will of mayo in which time of our voyage it fall out as often it happen in such action that our company be divide as be some seaman and the rest landman who be for the most part many time of contrary nature there be some heart-burn and malice one against another which rest not only in the common sort but rather and most chief in our captain who haughty mind not brook contradiction on either side have like to have grow to a dangerous distension have it not be appease by the diligent persuasion of some other of the company who plausible spirit be more addict to unity and peace than any way like of such dangerous and indirect course they well foreknow that civil discord have be the overthrow of mighty kingdom and great common weal and therefore well may have be the utter subversion of our so weak and slender govern company but all party be now as it seem to the outward view quiet we go a shore upon the say i will of mayo to take in fresh water and s^lt where we find 5. portugal which have be rob by the french and there set a shore where have stay five day hunt of goat and refresh of our man we depart to saint jago where we land the five portugal in reward of which kindness of we the inhabitant take three of our man and keep they as prisoner while they send seven league into the country to know the governors pleasure and at night send they aboard again have take certain commodity from they which they have to buy some of their fruit from thence have weigh our anchor with a merry gale we sail towards our desire place to the country of Guiana but miss of our expectation here begin the first scene of our ensue misery for whether it be our master want of knowledge that we fall not with the prefix place or that the current which our master allege to be the reason that set very strong to the north-ward put we so far short thereof or whither as of all other that be most certain it please God in that place at that time and in such a manner to let we feel some part of his heavy displeasure conceive against we for our time former misspend so as I say the end of our hope be the beginning of our misery for ply to and again wander as it be in a wilderness of woe betwixt hope and despair the time pass away and with the time our victual the only hop^ of our health exceed waste thereupon our allowance be great shorten and with the same and other occurrence our man mind very much distract which breed among we many fearful and dangerous mutiny and as one misery come still in the neck of another so fare it with we for with our want of victual we be near unto the equinoctial and the sun in that part of the zodiac which be near unto our zenith it be so exceed hot that with the vehemency thereof many of our man fall marvelous weak and some of they die namely our carpenter mate John Browne our cook and Robert pain and many other be be weak that they be not able to come above the hatch this extremity cause we though against our stomach to entreat the master to bring we to the near shore he can and so have be seventeen week at sea in stead of our hopeful expectation of attain to a pleasant rich and golden counteey and the comfortable company of our friend and countryman there as we suppose then resident we be bring to a island in the west India somewhat distant from the main call Santa Lucia have about twelve degree of north latitude inhabit only with a company of most cruel cannibal and man-eater where we have no soon anchor but the carebye come in their periagoe or boat aboard we with great store of tobacco planton potato pine sugar cane and diverse other fruit with hen chicken turtle and guavas for all which we content and please they well these Carrebyes at their first come in our sight do seem most strange and ugly by reason they be all naked with long black hair hang down their shoulder their body all paint with red and from their ear to their eye they do make three stroke with red which make they look like devil or antic face wherein they take a great pride the next morning we go a shore with all our weak man where there be six or seven house plant by a pleasant fresh water river which captain sen-iohns buy for a hatchet of a indian captain call Anthony who can speak a little spanish and he tell we he have be a slave to the Spaniard in the i will of Margareta so he and all his company go to another town some three mile of while our sick man be a shore refresh themselves our master will have depart and have leave they to shift among the Carrebyes but captain sen-iohn and the chief of our company will not consent thereto and see it be in vain all of we for to venture home in the ship with that small allowance we be willing to come a shore and there to live until it shall please God to send some mean to bring we a way upon that condition they shall deliver unto we one great piece and every man his musket and weapon and half the munition in the ship with all our chest and commodity whatsoever which he will not grant before we have subscribe to a certain write which he write to excuse himself at his return into England so we receive four little barrel of powder and ten round bullet for the great piece which when we bring a shore do much fear the indian for they ask we if we bring it to kill they but to please their humour we tell they it be to kill the spaniard and then they come and help we a shore with she and with all our chest of their own accord now after they have deliver all thing a shore out of the boat we think it good to stay she and to keep she for our own use for we do not know what need we may have of such a commodity afterward so we send the sailor aboard in a indian boat only three will not go but will stay with we so we be in all leave a shore threescore and seven in the isle of saint Lucca at night when we be all sit together at supper about a great fire which they can well perceive from the ship when it be dark and as it shall seem in revenge of their boat before they depart they purpose to let we know they be not well please with the action they shoot a great piece at we with a single bullet but as it please God it fall down by the side of our house and miss we which if it have come amongst we we sit so thick it can not have choose but have be the death of many of we this make captain sen-iohn discharge our piece at they without intent to hurt they but fair overshoot they for he may have sink they and will if they have shoot once more then present they weigh anchor and depart the next morning captain sen-iohn go in the boat with fifteen more in his company to trade with Anthonio his father for Rone cloth which he have save at sea great store but when we come there contrary to our expectation we find our ship there trade with they who have incense the indian sore against we tell they that we be have people and will take all they have from they and will cut their throat and as we tow alongst the shore they discharge half a dozen piece of ordnance and a volley of small shot at we but there great shot overshoot we and light upon the rock and scar the indian a shore mighty and their small shot light short without harm we their decermination be to drive we from our boat or else to have sink she for their great shot come so thick that we be force to leap a shore into the wood then they man their Periago and come to take our boat away which we perceive enter she again and escape all their malice so we return home again safe and they depart towards saint Vincent the eighteen or of August 1605. after the departure of our ship we remain in peaceable manner among the indian daily trade with they for all manner of victual as planton potato Penas papaians Pumpins gallobashoe pap mammy Guiavas with diverse other fruit and tobacco abundance all very pleasant to eat also they bring turtle hen and chicken woodcock and snipe with some pelican as for the turtle we ourselves do use every night by course to send out six to catch they which be easy do by reason that every night they use to come a shore and lay their egg in the sand and by the heat of the sun they be hatch at their come out of the water they do make as broad a tract as a cart with their sin by which mean we be lead to the place where they do sit and so we turn they on their back which be do they can do nothing but so lie till they be dead the meat of they do eat like unto veal and I have see take out of one of they to the number of six or seven hundred egg which we do fry with the fat or oil of the turtle and also with cassada we do make exceed good whitepot and pudding put the egg and oil into it also the guana be proportion like a serpent more than a ell long with four short foot in eat it be like a coney and have in his belly to the number of five and twenty or thirty egg this cassada be a root of a tree who juice be poison but be squeass the flower do make a excellent kind of bread and will keep long the indian do marvel much at our manner of dress our meat and they will be familiar and will dine with we very often but by no mean we can not make they eat salt for they use to eat all their meat season with guinea pepper their woman come very seldom unto we for they be very jealous over they once or twice there come some woman with they unto who we give shirt to cover their nakedness whereof they seem proud their ancient woman be very ugly by reason of their side breast which do lie like empty bag but those which have not give suck be well proportion and proper also we have a net with the which we will get at one draught as many fish of diverse sort as will serve all our company a day a little before our arrival three spanish ship be cast away and much of the good these indian have save with their boat and hide it in the wood they have so much Rouen cloth that all their periagoe have sail thereof they also have great store of stuff sirge and spanish woollen cloth cloak and apparel insomuch that if we have have a bark of forty tun burden we can have load she home with such commodity as will have make a save voyage all which we can have buy for hatchet knife bead fishhook and thimble with other trifle thus for the space of five or six week we go not much abroad but cut down the wood about our house every day and mount our great piece upon broad table which we ourselves have saw lest the Carrebyes shall at any time assault we soon after this there come another captain from saint Vincent call Augraumart which be brother to Anthonio who be offend with he for sell the house unto we for the which cause Anthonio bid we kill he and tell we he purpose to bring twelve periagoe load with Carrebyes to kill we but we find this Augraumart very kind unto we and be willing to do or tell we any thing we desire he for he teach we to make a which he make of small sharp flint stone beat into a broad board to grate our cassada on whereof we make our bread and he tell we that Anthonio will cut our throat and therefore bid we kill he this make we doubtful which to trust to we have certain article draw which be to be observe wherein captain Nicholas sen-iohn be captain his brother Alexander lieutenant Miles Pet and Philip glascock be commander for the appoint of our watch John Rogers be our interpreter for the spanish tongue and be to buy and bargain with the indian for all the company both for commodity and victual master garret master tench Francis brace and myself be appoint to order the domestical matter Carebie signify in their language a valiant man all the occasion that we make whereby the Carrebyes shall fall out with we be that one of our company do sell a sword unto captain Anthonio which be contrary to the article we have set down for none be upon pain of severe punishment to sell either sword dagger or hedgebill which when we know Alexander sen-iohn with a dozen more go to his house and find he in his bed which they call a Hamaco with a little fire under he because he be not well and the sword stand by he which young sen-iohn take and bring forth to we this drive he into a great rage against we for never after that will he be familiar with we the Carrebyes do wear for a ornament upon the small of their naked aim a foursquare plate which master Browne a goldfine tell captain sen-iohn have three part of it gold who ask the Carrebyes where they get it who present point we to a great mountain on the northwest part of the island who top we may see from the place where we dwell but Anthonio say there be none these contrary tale make we suspect some villainy and that it be but a policy to draw some of our company thither whereby they may the better deal with we for at home they d^rst not attempt any thing against we both for fear of our great piece and also we will not suffer they to bring their bow and arrow within our sentinel yet our captain will not be content till we consent that he shall go to the mountain and take with he all sort of commodity to bargain with the indian for cloth and he take old Browne the goldfine and his son George Browne John Rogers master look the three sailor who name be John Fleming Thomas Butler Owen a Welshman james garret and one joseph and Christopher two grocer and one master Euans with diverse more to the number of sixteen and upon a Monday they all embark in the boat take eight day victual with they promise to return betwixt that and the next Monday leave his brother Miles Pet Philip glascock m. garret m. tench and myself to rule at home upon Tuesday and Wednesday the indian do not come unto we with victual as they have wont which make we after suspect that they be at the slaughter of our man at the mount and upon Wednesday myself with 3. more go to Antonio house where we find a great number of woman but not pass half a score man make great preparation of victual some bake of cassada other roast and boil of great fish and turtle I offer to buy some of they but they refuse and will not neither will they look of any commodity we have which make we much marvel for before that time they never deny we so we depart and by the way we light of a narrow path wherein we travel a little and all along the way do grow abundance of Guiava tree who fruit be as big as a apple and very pleasant to eat the green one be wholesome for the bloody flux we have not travail a mile but we enter down by a thicket into a most pleasant garden of potato which drive we into great admiration to behold the manner of it for it be make round like a bower encompass with a green bank so equal that make we think some christian have make it for a strength to save they from the indian and upon the top thereof do grow a company of the most tall tree that ever I behold which do natural grow so near one to another and so thick from the root to the top that we can not perceive the sky through they but follow the path we perceive it to pass through a narrow cut in the bank where we travel two or three mile further pass through many goodly garden wherein be abundance of cassada potato tobacco cotten-wool-tree and Guiava tree in diverse place as we travail we do marvel to see the huge and great tree that be there for most of they be five or six fathom about and fear that we shall be benight we return the same way again with as much green tobacco potato and cassada as we can carry which do much content our man at home for the indian have not bring any victual in three day before at night six of our man go to seek for turtle and find two very great one but can not bring they home for when they have turn they on their back it begin to rain thunder and lighten so extreme that they have much a do to get home themselves and so it continue all night with the most horrible thunderclap that ever I hear with lightning and rain as light as day which cause we to awake and after prayer to fit all night by great fire drink of Tobacc with extraordinary mirth amongst ourselves little foresee the danger that befall to we the next day early the next morning we go to bring home our turtle and there we find a great number of Carrebyes on the shore and three or four boat by they roast of land crab for what purpose they be so gather together we know not but lest we shall suspect they of any bad intent towards we they will we to eat with they and bring home our turtle to our house all that forenoon we keep good watch for there be very many which come both by sea and land and Augraumart and his father come with a great number of indian and bring in his hand a quarter of a turtle and a hundred egg and give they to young sen-iohn and tell he that if he will go to his brother Antonius house he shall have great store of victual and that he shall see his wife and the more to persuade we to go he promise that we shall have hamaca for to sleep in which be the bed they use their woman do make they of Cotten that grow natural on the tree whereof they have abundance we many time make s^te unto they for their hamaca because they will be a mean to save we from the sting of curtain Flor call a musketo the which will so torment we with their pay love sting and cause we to swell as though we have the leprosy for they will sting through three pair of stocking but they be not willing till now on the sudden that we shall have any and because they be so kind to we we take they all into our house and be very merry and pleasant with they and give they which they delight much in but master tench who have wont to be a curious corrector of we in our merriment do show himself so extraordinary pleasant that he fall a sing of catch with the Carrebyes and cause they in drink carouse of and water if we have be determine to have kill they we may have do it at that time with small danger we have a hundred and above of they within out house without either dough or arrow and when some of our company make such a motion as to put they to the sword for some of we be half and more jealous of they that they have do some mischief to our captain by reason one of our company do say that he hear a indian say that the captain of the english have his hand cut off at the mount but this be not regard but be impute that he have misconstrue the carrobye language master tench be against it say God will not be please with such a bloody act against such harmless people and therefore will we not to do it without they give the first occasion wherein he wrong himself and we all in seek to save the life of they who within three hour after most cruel murder he before dinner they all depart but Augraumart and his father who dine with we and present after dinner eighteen be choose to go to Antonio house with Augraumart and his father who have neither bow nor arrow only his father have a brasell sword this they do lest we shall suspect their treachery but we not fear any treason because we have be often time well use there before go on bold and some of our company think that the very fight of our piece be sufficient to terrify they for attempt any villainy against we and therefore do not negarde either to charge they or to light our match in this careless and secure manner we travail through a little neck of land which run far into the sea and then we enter upon the sand which be so extreme hot with the reflection of the sun that we be not able to travail apace be load with our piece but master Alexander have put off his doublet and give his boy his piece and go jest and play arm in arm with the two Carrebyes a good space before we until we come to a point of land a quarter of a mile from Antonio house and then he call we to come forward but he be light and cool do keep a great way before we still and when he least suspect danger augraum^^t make as though he will embrace he and sudden clasp hold with one hand on his rapier and the other on his dagger and his father with a great Brussell sword strike he down before we can come at he but he recover again then come the arrow so thick out of the wood that we can not get our match in the cock for pull the arrow out of our body so among we all be but five or six piece discharge which when the indian see give fire they do fall flat on the ground shout and cry with a most hellish noise name we by our name when they hit we then we retire back to a point of land think there to have fit our piece and to have give they a volley of shot but there come another ambush on our back and round about we insomuch that we be enforce to forsake our piece and betake we to our sword which do much encourage they for when they see we can not hurt they with our piece they will come so near we as though they purpose to make choice in what place to hit we of some they shoot in the face other through the shoulder and of other they will nail their foot and the ground together master Budge and Robert Shaw run into the sea and there be both drown and kill with arrow master tench have a little Bucklet with the which bee do save himself a long time but at the last a arrow pass through both his leg that he can not go and stoop to pull it out they kill he and if any of we offer to run at one or two of they they will run away and of a sudden twenty or thirty will enclose we and still shoot arrow in they till they be down and then will they with a great brassell sword beat they to death and after will rifle they master kettleby do behave himself very gallant for he do not respect what arrow he receive in his body so he can but reach one stroke at a carrebye but they be too nimble for we in regard they be naked yet nevertheless we run through they all think that if we have escape that ambush there have be no more to trouble we but as I be a pull arrow out of his body to the number of twenty at the least there come the three ambush out of the wood from whence come a arrow and hit he in the breast which he perceive will be his death for he can not stand but as I hold he but I be force to let he go and shift to save myself then I over take young sen-iohn his body almost full of arrow of which I pull out a number but what for the blood that run from he and the extreme heat he be in by his run he be not able to overtake the re^t of our company that be before and still the Carrebyes do gather ground upon we and the arrow come thick on every side then he will i to entreat they stay and when I have overtake one I cause he to stay which he be unwilling to do for he tell i his sword will not come forth of the scabbard so I take hold of the hilt and betwixt we both pull it out but before we have make a end these cruel and bloody Carrebyes have encompass young sen-iohn yet to my grief I do stand and behold his end who before he fall do make they run like so many cur from a lion for look which way he run they all flee before he his body be so load with arrow that he fall to the ground and upon one hand and knee he do keep they from he with his sword so much he scorn so base to die at their hand we two be then the only mark they aim at for have rifle young Seniohus they pursue we very hot which cause we make haste to four of our fellow who be enter into a narrow path which lead through the wood from the sand to the house where we dwell but there be in the path a other ambush which drive they back to the sand again and when they see we so hardly chase they enter the path with we again the one side of the path be a high mountain the other go down a low valley the first four take up the mountain by which mean they be a fair mark for they to hit who drop down one after another all this time neither harry which be m. Stokeleys man a merchant now in Bucklersbery nor myself be shoot but as we think desperate to run through they in the narrow path there come a arrow and pierce quite through his head of the which he fall sudden and I run to lift he up but he be dead without speak one word to i at all then come there two arrow and hit i in the back the one direct against my heart the other through my shoulder blade so with my sword in my hand I run upon they desperate think before I have die to have be the death of some of they and in my run I see captain Anthony with a arrow in his bow draw against i who stand until I come very near he for he purpose to have speed i with that shot which when I see come I think to put it by with my sword but it light on my hand and pass through the handle of my sword and nail both together but I continue run at he still and before he can nock another I make he and all the rest turn their back and run into the sand again which opportunity when I espy I leap into the wood down to the valley where I find a great lake and hear they with great shout and cry which they use in sign of triumph and victory pursue i still I leap into the lake with my sword nail to my hand and two arrow in my back and by the help of God swim over but with much ado for the further side be shallow water but I wade in mud up to the waste which have almost spend i now when I be over I convey myself into the thick part of the wood make all the haste I can to give my fellow which be at home warning lest the indian shall set on they unaware and in my go I come into a path and seek for a great tree to see if by the aim of the island I can perceive which way our house stand then sudden I hear a great noise which make i stand behind a tree and there I see two or three indian go by i which I imagine be go to set on they at home but it please God I get home and give warning before their come so Miles Pet charge our great piece and all our man be in readiness for their come then present they all come in sight upon the sand who we send away by shoot of our great piece and come no more in 3. day in which time we fortify ourselves with our chest and upon Monday morning before we have make a end of prayer there come to the number of 13. or 14. c. indian both by sea and land and there beset we round make a noise with their horn and make most horrible cry which they no use the more to terryfle their enemy and we do answer they again with the like cry divide ourselves into 4 part according as we have make our fort of our chest place five in every fort and three to the great piece where Miles Pett myself and another be then they shoot their arrow among we as thick as hail and lest they shall follow in upon we and make use of those arrow again we gather they all together and make great fire with they before their face and many time they purpose to rush in upon we by multitude and to have beat we down with their brazell sword but our great piece be so mount that very ready we can turn it which way we please and look which way their great company go we let she fly among they so perceive that they can not prevail against we they put Cotten wool upon the end of their arrow and put fire on they and shoot at our house which be make on long cane or reed and sudden take fire by reason of the heat of the day and burn down to the ground fasten on our chest which be our fort and burn all down to the ground the extreme heat of the flame do make our man forsake their fort and retire behind the great piece to the seaside which encourage the carraby mighty m. William kettleby lay close unseen of the indian upon the sand and with a long piece he will reach they 12. score pace and gall they much otherwise they will have come on the back of we by sea but he shoot their boat thorough and thorough and scare they for enter that way now when all our man be flee behind the great piece only Philip Glascocke and Richard Garrat stand behind the smoke and mark where they purpose to enter and each of they discharge half a score time at they at last Philip Glascocke receive a arrow in his head and richard Garrat one in his breast and two in his back and when the indian see that all be flee but they two they purpose to enter through the smoke upon we but in the enter he give a warning to Miles Pett to turn the piece against the smoke which present we do and let fly among they and drive they all back with most lamentable skrike and cry no doubt but that shot be the death of many of they for she be charge with stone then they blow their great horn and all retired back to their boat without shoot one arrow at we after that our house be burn and all our chest which before be our fort we fortify ourselves with the remnant of the stake and thatch which we save from burn set it in the ground slepewise cover it with sand and earth which save we ever after from their arrow in all these extreme danger and imminent calamity which all this while we endure let the christian reader judge in what a perplex state we be plunge see still one misery to follow another and each misery far exceed the former as first our danger at sea to be famish then a comfortless remedy against famishment to be let in a far remote and unknown place among a cruel barbarous and inhuman people without hope of ever have any mean to recover the sight of our native and dear country and friend then the loss of our captain and other which before in all extremity be still some comfort unto we and now last these lamentable stratagem of the massacre of our fellow and friend therein see as in a glass the utter ruin and butcherly murder of our own self be we make most assure account to drink of the same cup but this be the least of our fear and not the great of our misery for be now for a time rid of our bloodthirsty * * which depart in their enemy our provision of victual be all waste spend and spoil and have no mean to get any more it will have move the heart of the cruel tyrant in the world to compassion but in the midst of all this unendurable misery it please God contrary to our expectation in some sort to relieve we even by our enemy for when all the rest be out of sight one Periago return very well provide of victual and three or four come on land with as much as they be able to carry of cassada potato and planton and cry unto we to exchange with they first hold up their bow and after lay they on the ground again in sign of peace which we perceive send out three likewise to bargain without weapon carry knife bead and other trifle which be do they depart and we return give praise to God thus miraculous for to feed we for we have no mean of ourselves to get any then the net with the which we have wont get asmuch fish of all sort as will suffice we all for a day the indian take from we thus for the space of 6. or 7. day every day fight for the space of three or four hour and then our victual begin to fail again which cause we to hold out a flag of truce which the indian perceive come in peaceable manner unto we then one Francis brace by mean of his french tongue make they understand that our desire be to give they all that we have if they will let we have a Periago to carry we away which one captain Antonio willing consent unto and the next day after bring she draw she ashore within the compass of our fort we give they of hatchet knife and bead until they be content and to please they the more we give they every one a shovel or a spade and so they depart and then we go all to work some to make the sail which we make of very good roane-cloath and some to make the mast and every one do labour all that he can to be ready against night for Antonio tell we that his brother Angravemart will come the next day from s. Vincent with twelve all lade with man and arrow who word we always find true for he can not dissemble and we conclude rather than we will stay and die so miserable at the carraby hand who thirst for nothing but to eat our flesh and drink our blood as they have do with many other of our fellow we promise unto the lord who have all this time fight for we to betake ourselves unto his mercy and doubt not but that he will guide we safe to some christian harbour and upon the 26 of September 1605. at one a clock after midnight we embark all 19 in that little vessel or boat which the indian have make all of one tree she be not so broad as a Wherry but it be almost as long again our rope for our sail be our garter and our yard a lance she have a little Rother or helm but not one of our company have skill how to use it neither have we compass to direct we but sail by the sun in the day and by the star in the night keep always betwixt south-west and west for we imagine the main land of the west-indies lay so the victual that we have be not sufficient to serve that company three day for we have not above twenty biscuit three cassada cake a dozen planton and some thirty potato and of water some four or five gallon and a little barrel half full of rice which master Garrard have give he to serve in the country of Guyana if we have get thither and as it please the lord he have save it until this our great necessity for the preservation of our life for all our other victual be go in two day our water in three day and then Richard Garrard give to every two of we a porindish of his rice twice a day which we wash in salt water and so eat it rawt thus we continue at sea seek for land for the space of ten day where we endure one great tempest although to our great peril look always when we shall be swallow up in the huge wave the storm continue for the space of four and twenty hour both boisterous for wind and rain for all the sea be in a white foome which be unto we in the midst of our danger a great comfort for we save the rain water and drink it glad thank God for that good refresh who likewise send the very fowl of that air to leede we for they be weary of their flight will rest they on the side of our boat so that we take they and dry they in the sun with a little gunpowder and eat they our boat be so near the water that every wave come over her ready to sink she but that four of we do nothing but lave it out again by course to speak of the misery we endure there it be unpossible for I can express it upon the ten day after our come forth of s. Lucia be the five of October one Thomas Morgane die not be able to live of that small allowance and at twelve a clock at noon we throw he overboard and within a hour after it please God to glad we with a joyful sight of the land then we boi up our sail fall to row with all the force we can make to the near place imagine all danger be pass but the wind be calm we be benight before we can come at it and so want the light of the day we be upon the rock before we be aware and by reason that the breach of the wave be so great and violent we can not hold she off but forcible run against the rock and there split our boat to the very midst and all our man turn out I only hold the helm think the next wave will heave she over the rock not know she to be split but the breach be so great that it turn i under put i in great danger to be grate to piece with her weight above i against the great rock and at the last we all recover ourselves some sit upon great rock other on the root of great tree think there to save ourselves till the morning and I find a long pole which fall out of our beat take it and ask if any will venture to the shore with i which Francis brace perceive take the other-ende so we two wade to the land and then the rest all follow and some bring perrywinckle in their hand and break they out of the shell and do eat they raw then every one cry out for fresh water so William pick and myself go to seek for water but we have not go half a hour but we come to our fellow again without find of any water to comfort we withal so the place where we land prove to be a break island encompass with the sea about a league from the main as soon as it be day we ^igged pity's in the ground for fresh water but can find none that be to be drink some go to the boat to save such commodity as be leave undrve away with the sea other find perrywinckle on the rock which be all the victual we have to eat but our stomach be so weak we can not eat above two or three a day thus not know what course to take to save our life from famine one Miles Pet William pick and myself go and hale the boat out of the rock to the shore which be split to the very midst and so far with our sword we cut off and put in a head in the midst and fasten it with our dagger knife and bodkin stop all the leak with our shirt so five of our company venture in she to the main land their name be Miles Pett William Kettlebie William pick Francis brace and William butcher leave Richard Garrard Philip Glascocke John coxford and myself with the rest in this hungry and desolate island and at last it please God to bring they to the main land they hale their boat alongst the shore cross many great river wherein they be pursue by diverse devour serpent of the sea as the who be of such force that they will pull a horse under water and devour he and will travel more than two league from the water to seek their prey and also that greedy shark who have three rank of tooth set like a see and will bite off a man thigh at one snatch yet God preserve they miraculous and when they be like to give over travel be in despair for ever to find any spaniard for to succour they with food God pity their estate guide they to a place where they find a great earthen pot full of wheat flower which they boil with fresh water a pot of flower set in a cave by some indian and satisfy their hungry appetite with thanks to God for the same and within two day after they meet with three spaniard and with half a dozen indian and Negro travel from Carraccas to Coro drive horse and mule load with merchandise who see their weakness for want of victual unload their beast to feed on the grass while they feed our hungry man with plenty of their good cheer show they great courtesy suffer they to ^ide and go themselves afoot two or three day till they come to a town of civil indian call Tocoya where they stay to refresh they and there they let the spaniard know in what miserable case they leave we in a desolate island where we endure the great misery that ever man do and live for we continue fifteen day have no kind of meat but periwinkle or whelk tobacco and salt-water which do nothing at all nourish we yet it take away the desire of hunger and save we from eat one another in that fifteen day five of our company pine to death for hunger their name be John Perkins Edward Greene Jerome Swash Thomas stub and a old man call John tobacco be the chief food I find to do i good and do preserve my life and those which can take it down do keep strong but those which can not take it at all die first by note one or two of our man to die we know when any of we draw near our death which be first they will swell very big and after fall to the very bone and then want natural strength in their back to hold up their head it will fall down and droop in there bosom and within twelve hour after they will die at the 15. day end Francis brace have more strength than the rest guide the three spaniard to the island where we be we little expect it for we think they have be kill either by wild beast or savage and we have give over look for comfort but every one particular desire God that himself may not be the last man of die which conceit be worse than death itself unto we but his return do add much comfort unto we in that dis^esse for they bring we victual which when we have eat have almost kill we by reason of the weakness of our stomach be so far spend that we can not digest it although we do eat it very spare the next day the spaniard carry we to the main land where we have horse bring we and the good we have they take it all for the king of Spain use and then they convey we to Tocoya where we which be weak remain for fifteen day and those which be strong go to Coro fifty league from Tocoya at the 15. day end one of the three spaniard who name be signior Carow Vallo come for we with horse who show himself as careful to we as if we have be his own countryman and friend and in 5. day bring we to Coro to our fellow where we be bring before the governor and by a Fleming which can speak a little english which have be prisoner there sixteen year we be examine of the cause of our come on that coast who excuse we very well for he know that if we confess whither we be determine to go meaning Guiana they will either have put we to death or condemn we to the galley to row but ^e tell they that we never purpose to come into the west indies but that we be by misfortune and tempest drive on that coast and tell they of all the misery and danger we have endure and escape which drive they into great admiration say we be devil and not man and the Fleming tell we the father of their church say that if we have be good christian we deserve to be canonize for saint but in regard we be lutheran it be more by the devil mean then by the providence of God we escape those danger so all the chief of the town be there every man be desirous to take one of we who do not use we like prisoner but be as careful of we as of their own child not suffer we to want any thing that be necessary for the procure of our health myself be extreme sick of the Callienturo one captain who marry his daughter with who I dwell who name be Francisco Lopus have good skill in physic come daily to my chamber and there let i blood purge and diet i give his daughter in charge not to

country and kill dear and wild pork for we and will bring we ape munckye parrot and any thing that they think we delight in the country there about Coro do yield abundance of sugar honey ginger and pitch also they have very good wheat grow there but their bread be altogether make of Maiz of that which they have great plenty for they reap four time a year this Maiz they do make it with the juice of suger-cane which make it a excellent kind of bread and it will keep long as biscuit also they make their drink of this Maiz and of potato which be very strong and sweet for the indian will quick be drink therewith whilst we be there a Spaniard ride into the country to a place of his with his brother to make tobacco where he have many indian dwell one of his chief indian which use to be familiar with he take a new hatchet which his master have bring with he and ask his master what it cost and sudden cleave his head therewith which his brother perceive run for his rapier think to revenge it but the indian woman have steal it a way before and so they kill he also with their bow and arrow and three or four negro which seem to resist they and thereupon he flee to the mountain gather a great company unto he promise they that if they will aid he against the spaniard in Coro he will give they their wife and daughter in marriage but before they put it in practice captain by a policy take he feast among his fellow and woman and take thirty with he and bring all to Coro where they be to suffer death with great torment to terrify the rest not to do the like and of some they cut off their thumb and cut the sinew of their two forefinger whereby they want the benefit of shoot our entertainment be such that we can not desire to part from they to come into our own country without offend they for there be a frigate at Coro ready to go for Carthagena four of we make entreaty for passage which be Philip Glascocke Richard Garrard William pick and myself all the rest be in the country upon pleasure some in one place and some in another and when the ship be ready to depart our signior persuade the governor not to let we go without he have a letter from the viceroy that we may pass in safety into Spain and so for England and then he show they a letter that it be at our own choice whether we will go or tarry yet because they be loath to part with we they will the father of their church to tell we that if we will stay we shall be as themselves and they will willing bestow their daughter and their good upon we also they tell we that now England and Spayn be all one in religion and that our saviour Christ come in a vision upon the cross and appear before our king majesty and tell he that he be in a error and bid he turn and be as the catholic be for they be good christian and how at the sight thereof three of our chief bishop be strike into a trance for the space of three day and after they recover again they preach that they shall all repent and become catholic add further that the king have send to the pope to send learned man into England to teach their doctrine aright which we well perceive be only the suggestion of their popish priest thereby to have make we hearken to their doctrine yet notwithstanding all their allurement on both side our desire be for our own country and so three procure mean for to go but William pick by mean the governor say that four be too many to venture in the ship be stay so about the last of April Philip Glascocke Richard Garrard and myself take our leaf to depart leave all with who we dwell very sorry who give we great store of provision for our passage and weep as though they have part from their own brother and child they be very loath to let we go to Carthagena for fear we shall be put into the galley and the governor of Coro himself write unto the chief man of Carthagena in our commendation as to don Pedro bar who be his son in law but it take small effect for as soon as we arrive there which be the six
