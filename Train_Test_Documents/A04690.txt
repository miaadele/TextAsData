A DISCOVERY OF THE BARMVDAS, OTHER VVISE called the Ile of Diuels.
I Being in ship called the seaventure, with Sir THOMAS Gates, our Gouernour, Sir GEORGE Sommers, and Captaine Newport, three most worthy honoured Gentlemen, (whose valour and fortitude the world must needes take notice off, and that in most Honourable
designes) bound for Virginia, in the height of thirty degrees of northerly latitude, or thereabouts: we were taken with a most sharpe and cruell storme vpon the fiue and twentieth day of Iuly, Anno 1609. which did not only separate vs from the residue of our fleete, (which were eight in number) but with the violent working of the Seas, our ship became so shaken, torne, and leaked, that shee receiued so much water, as couered two ^ire of hogsheads aboue the ballast; that our men stoode vp to the middles, with buckets, baricos, and kettles, to baile out the water, and continually pumped for three dayes and three nights together, without any intermission; and yet the water seemed rather to increase, then to diminish: in so much that all our men, being vtterly spent, tyred, and disabled for longer labour, were euen resolued, without any hope of their
liues, to shut vp the hatches, and to haue committed themselues to the mercy of the sea, (which is said to be mercilesse) or rather to the mercy of their mighty God and redeemer, (whose mercies exceed all his works) seeing no helpe, nor hope, in the apprehension of mans reason, that any mothers child could escape that ineuitable danger, which euery man had proposed and digested to himselfe, of present sinking. So that some of them hauing some good and comfortable waters in the ship, fetcht them, and drunke one to the other, taking their last leaue one of the other, vntill their more ioyfull and happy meeting, in a more blessed world; when it pleased God out of his most gracious and mercifull prouidence, so to direct and guide our ship, (being left to the mercy of the sea) for her most aduantage; that Sir George Sommers (sitting vpon the poope of the ship, (where he sate
three dayes and three nights together, without meales meate, and little or no sleepe) couning the shippe to keepe her as vpright as he could, (for otherwise shee must needes instantly haue foundred) most wishedly happily discryed land; whereupon he most comfortably encouraged the company to follow their pumping, and by no meanes to cease bayling out of the water, with their buckets, baricos, and kettles; whereby they were so ouer wearied, and their spirits so spent with long fasting, and continuance of their labour, that for the most part they were fallen asleepe in corners, and wheresoeuer they chanced first to sit or lie: but hearing news of land, wherewith they grew to bee somewhat reuiued, being carried with wil and desire beyond their strength, euery man busled vp, and gathered his strength and feeble spirits together, to performe as much as their weake
force would permit him: through which weake meanes, it pleased God to worke so strongly as the water was staide for that little time, (which as we all much feared, was the last period of our breathing) and the ship kept from present sinking, when it pleased God to send her within halfe an English mile, of that land that Sir George Sommers had not long before discryed: Which were the Ilandes of the Barmudas. And there neither did our ship sincke, but more fortunately in so great a misfortune, fell in betweene two rockes, where shee was fast lodged and locked, for further budging: whereby we gayned, not only sufficient time, with the present helpe of our boate, and skiffe, safely to set, and conuey our men ashore (which were one hundred and fifty in number) but afterwards had time and leasure to saue some good part of our goodes and prouision,
which the water had not spoyled, with all the tackling of the ship, and much of the yron about her, which were necessaries not a litle auaileable, for the building and furnishing of a new ship and pinnis, which we made there, for the transporting and carrying of vs to Virginia. But our deliuery was not more strange in falling so opportunely, and happily vpon the land, as our feeding and preseruation, was beyond our hopes, and all mens expectations most admirable. For the Ilands of the Barmudas, as euery man knoweth that hath heard or read of them, were neuer inhabited by any Christian or Heathen people, but euer esteemed, and reputed, a most prodigious and inchanted place, affoording nothing but gusts, stormes, and foule weather; which made euery Nauigator and Mariner to auoide the^, as Scylla and Charibdis; or as they would shunne the Deuill
himselfe; and no man was euer heard, to make for the place, but as against their wils, they haue by stormes and dangerousnesse of the rocks, lying seauen leagues into the Sea, suffered shipwracke; yet did we finde there the ayre so temperate and the Country so aboundantly fruitful of all fit necessaries, for the sustentation and preseruation of mans life, that most in a manner of all our prouisions of bread, beare, and victuall, being quite spoyled, in lying long drowned in salt water, notwithstanding we were there for the space of nine moneths (few dayes ouer or vnder) not only well refreshed, comforted, and with good satiety contented, but out of the aboundance thereof, prouided vs some reasonable quantity and proportion of prouision, to carry vs for Virginia, and to maintaine our selues, and that company wee ^ound there, to the great releefe of
them, as it fell out in their so great extremities, and in respect of the shortnesse of time, vntill it pleased God, that by my Lords comming thither, their store was better supplyed. And greater, and better prouisions wee might haue made, if we had had better meanes for the storing and transportation thereof. Wherefore my opinion sincerely of this Iland is, that whereas it hath beene, and is still accounted, the most dangerous infortunate, and most forlorne place of the world, it is in truth the richest, healthfullest, and pleasing land, (the quantity and bignesse thereof considered) and meerely naturall, as euer man set foote vpon: the particular profits and benefits whereof, shal be more especially inserted, and hereunto annexed, which euery man to his owne priuate knowledge, that was there, can auouch and iustifie for a truth. Vpon the eight and twentieth
day of Iuly 1609. (after the extremity of the storme, was something qualified) we fell vpon the shore at the Barmudas; where after our generall Sir Thomas Gates, Sir George Sommers, and Captaine Newport, had by their prouident carefulnesse landed all their men, and so much of the goods and prouisions out of the ship, as was not vtterly spoyled, euerie man disposed and applyed himselfe, to search for, and to seeke out such releefe and sustentation, as the Country afforded: and Sir George Sommers, a man inured to extremities, (and knowing what thereunto belonged) was in this seruice, neither idle nor backward, but presently by his carefull industry, went and found out sufficient, of many kind of fishes, and so plentifull thereof, that in halfe an houre, he tooke so many great fishes with hookes, as did suffice the whole company one day. And fish is there
so aboundant, that if a man steppe into the water, they will come round about him; so that men were faine to get out for feare of byting. These fishes are very fat and sweete, and of that proportion and bignesse, that three of them will conueniently lade two men: those we called rock fish. Besides there are such aboundance of mullets, that with a seane might be taken at one draught one thousand at the least, and infinite store of pilchards, with diuers kindes of great fishes, the names of them vnknowne to me: of crayfishes very great ones, and so great store as that there hath beene taken in one night with making lights, euen sufficient to feede the whole co^pany a day. The Country affordeth great aboundance of Hogs, as that there hath beene taken by Sir George Sommers, who was the first that hunted for them, to the number of two and thirty at one
time, which he brought to the company in a boate, built by his owne hads. There is Fowle in great numvpon the Ilands, where they breed, that there hath beene taken in two or three houres, a thousand at the least; the bird being of the bignesse of a good Pidgeon, and layeth egges as bigge as Hen egges vpon the sand, where they come and lay them dayly, although men sit downe amongst them; that there hath beene taken vp in one morning, by Sir Thomas Gates men, one thousand of egges: and Sir George Sommers men, comming a little distance of time after them, haue stayed there whilst they came and layed their eggs amongst them, that they brought away as many more with them; with many young birds very fat and sweet. Another Sea fowle there is that lyeth in litle holes in the ground, like vnto a cony-hole, and are in great numbers, exceeding
good meate, very fat and sweet (those we had in the winter) and their eggs are white, and of that bignesse, that they are not to be knowne from Hen egges. The other birds egges are speckled, and of a different colour: there are also great score and plenty of Herons, and those so familiar and tame, that wee beate them downe from the trees with stones and staues; but such were young Herons: besides many white Herons, without so much as a blacke or gray feather on them; with other small birds so tame and gentle, that a man walking in the woods with a slicke, and whistling to them, they wil come and gaze on you, so neare that you may strike and kill many of them with your sticke; and with singing and hollowing you may doe the like. There are also great store of Tortoses, (which some call Turtles) and those so great, that I haue seene a
bushel of egges in one of their bellies, which are sweeter then any Henne egge: and the Tortose it selfe, is all very good meate, and yeeldeth great store of oyle, which is as sweete as any butter; and one of them will suffice fifty men a meale, at the least: and of these hath beene taken great store, with two boates, at the least forty in one day. The Country yeeldeth diuers fruits, as prickled peares, great aboundance, which continue greene vpon the trees all the yeare; also great plenty of Mulberries, white and red: and on the same are great store of Silke-wormes, which yeeld cods of silke, both white and yellow, being some course, and some fine. And there is a tree called a Palmito tree, which hath a very sweet berry, vpon which the hogs doe most feede; but our men finding the sweetnesse of them, did willingly share with the hogs for them, they being very pleasant
and wholsome, which made them carelesse almost of any bread with their meate; which occasioned vs to carry in a manner all that store of flower and meale, we did or could saue for Virginia. The head of the Palmito tree is very good meate, either raw or sodden, it yeeldeth a head which waigheth about twenty pound, and is farre better meate, then any cabbidge. There are an infinite number of Cedar trees, (the fairest I thinke in the world) and those bring forth a very sweet berry, and wholsome to eate. The Country (for as much as I could find my self, or heare by others) affords no venimous creature, or so much as a Rat or Mouse, or any other thing vnwholsome. There is great store of Pearle, and some of them very faire, round, and Orientall; and you shall finde at least one hundred seede of Pearle in one Oyster; there hath
beene likewise found, some good quantity of Amber Greece, and that of the best sort. There are also great plenty of Whales, which I conceaue are very easie to be killed, for they come so vsually, and ordinarily to the shore, that we heard them oftentimes in the night a bed; and haue seene many of them neare the shore, in the day time. There was borne vpon the Barmudas, at the time of our being there two children, the one a man child, there baptised, by the name of Barmudas: and a woman child, baptised by the name of Barmuda: as also there was a marriage betweene two English people vpon that Iland. This Iland, I meane the mayne Iland, with all the broken Ilandes adiacent, are made in the forme of a half Moone, but a little more rounder, and diuided into many broken Ilands,
and there are many good harbours in it, but wee could finde one especiall place to goe in, or rather to goe out from it, which was not altogether free from some danger, and that lyeth on the Southeast-side, where there is three fathoms water, at the entrance therof, but within sixe, seauen, or eight fathoms at the least, where you may safely lie land-locked, from the danger of all winds and weathers, and more to the trees. The co^ming into it, is so narrow and straight betweene the rocks, as that it will with small store of munition be fortified, and easily defended, with all aduantage the place affords, against the forces of the Potentest King of Europe. There are also plenty of Haukes, and very good Tobacco, as I thinke, which through forgetfulnesse, I had almost omitted:
now hauing finished and rigged our ship, and pinnis, the one called the Deliuerance, the pinnis the Patience, wee prepared and made our selues ready, to ship for Virginia, hauing powdred some store of hogs flesh, for prouision thither, and the company thereof, for some reasonable time: but were compelled to make salt there for the same purpose, for all our salt was spent and spoyled, before wee recouered the shore. Wee carryed with vs also a good portion of Tortose oyle, which either for frying or baking did vs very great pleasure, it being very sweete, nourishing, and wholsome: the greatest defects we found there, was tarre and pitch for our ship and pinnis, in steede whereof wee were forced to make lime there of a hard kinde of stone, and vse it: which for the present occasion and necessity,
with some wax we found cast vp by the Sea, from some ship wracke, serued the turne to pay the seames of the pinnis Sir George Sommers built, for which hee had neither pitch nor tarre: so that God in the supplying of all our wants, beyond all measure, shewed himselfe still mercifull vnto vs, that we might accomplish our intended voyage to Virginia, for which I confidently hope, hee doth yet reserue a blessing in store, and to the which I presume, euery honest and religious heart will readily giue their Amen. When all thinges were made ready, and commodiously fitted, the winde comming faire, wee set saile and put off from the Barmudas, the tenth day of May, in the yeare 1610. and arriued at Iames towne in Virginia, the foure and twentieth day of the same Moneth: where
wee found some threescore persons liuing. And being then some three weeks or thereabouts passed, and not hearing of anye supply, it was thought fitting by a generall consent, to vse the best meanes for the preseruation of all those people that were liuing, being all in number two hundred persons. And so vpon the eight of Iune one thousand six hundred and ten, wee imbarked at Iames Towne: not hauing aboue fourteene dayes victaile, and so were determined to direct our course for new-found-land, there to refresh vs, and supply our selues with victaile, to bring vs home; but it pleased God to dispose otherwise of vs, and to giue vs better meanes. For being all of vs shipped in foure pinnices, and departed from the towne, almost downe half the Riuer, wee met my Lord de la
Warre comming vp with three ships, well furnished with victaile, which reuiued all the company, and gaue them great content. And after some few dayes, my Lord vnderstanding of the great plenty of Hogges and Fish, was at the Barmudas, and the necessity of them in Virginia, was desirous to send thither, to supply himselfe with those things, for the better comforting of his men, and the plantation of the Country. Whereupon Sir George Sommers being a man best acquainted with the place, and being willing to doe seruice vnto his Prince and Country: without any respect of his owne priuate gaine: and being of threescore yeares of age at the least, out of his worthy and valiant minde, offered himselfe to vndertake to performe with Gods help that dangerous voyage
for the Barmudas, for the better releefe and comfort of the people in Virginia, and for the better plantation of it, which offer my Lord de la warre, very willingly and thankfully accepted: and so vpon the nineteenth of Iune, Sir George Sommers imbarked himself at Iames towne in a small barge of thirty tonne, or therabout, that he built at the Barmudas: wherein he laboured from morning vntill night, as duelie as any workeman doth labour for wages, and built her all with Cedar, with little or no yron worke at all: hauing in her but one boult, which was in the k^son: notwithstanding thanks be to God, shee brought vs in safety to Virginia, and so I trust he will protect him, and send him well backe againe, to his hearts desire, and the great comfort of all the company there.

The Barmudas lyeth in the height of two and thirty degrees and a halfe, of Northerly latitude, Virginia bearing directly from it, West, North west, two hundred and thirty leagues.
