the invitement to this golden trade show the cause of the first king it and orderly proceed therein it have be the usual course for the most part of such as travail foreign part in the obseruiug and set down such thing as they see to neglect the note of what be hold public in regard that after the whole company be they 60. 40. or but ten together have take perfect view it stand conceit the same be as well manifest to our whole country whereby diverse time many thing worthy of note here at home to such as take pleasure in read of other man adventure and delight in variety of other nation be either quite leave out or slit in so poor a manner as the reader go away unsatisfied I have receive this caveat from that worthy gentleman mr. Samuel who be so diligent a searcher and setter forth of all our english travail of who true industry those great volume he have publish to the world shall be perpetual witness spend therein as he right term it his talon for his country service and be likewise encourage by he after he have see and read my journal brief relate each day particular in my travail into this great and spacious country whereof by God grace I intend to write lay as it be a command upon i not to conceal that which by publish may first tend unto the advancement of God glory and next undoubted the honour wealth and preferment of our own nation likewise have be still earnest invite by all sort of people and especial by some of worthy note as occasion have fall out at any time whereby I have be draw into discourse of these travail that I ought not nor may not without offence leave unpublish that which do proffer so apparent hope of so great a golden trade which at this time seem so needful that by the general complant of our great want the earth have shut up her rich bowel towards we in other place the rather to invite we to seek after that which lie as it be under our nose in respect of other travail and have be lest as a conceal business untell our time of need that then it may be more effectual follow and more serious regard for apparent proof whereof first there be no historian but will accord that in all ancient history discourse of the inward part of Africa assure always call by the name of Ethiopia it have be note for the golden region in the whole conquest of Alexinder as Curtius set it down lie only have a great desire to visit these part of Ethiopia but never come there the roman likewise careful relater of their great victory do speak little of the interior part of Africa their great entrance be in the war of jugurth and in pursuit of he only mention be make of a great desire they have to search the south part in regard they be thereunto invite by those rich and golden arm they find those black people to come against they withal where of so many golden shield be carry to their famous city in their so glorious triumph but in their discovery they have no success return with the loss of most of their people in regard as be allege they meet with diverse dry and sandy desert to pass wherein as many be lose and overwhelm so again the parch heat and continual drought be cause of the perish of many other and enforce their return without any satisfaction the self same cause continue still for which we need not search write book but talk or discourse with any merchant of this city of London who have yearly trade and commerce in Barbary be the near part of Africa adjoin unto we and many time from our country into their principal harbour run in twelve day and in the like time again from they to we and inquire of they whence the Moor of Barbary have that rich gold he make his Chequens of and they will tell you there be no gold grow within the confine of Morocco or Fez at least that be know or make use of but that the great abundance of the trade of the moor in in Barbary for their gold that rich gold they have be fetch and bring into the country by the natural inhabitant for which they undergo great travail only by land wherein they do pass great desert of sand with much danger as appear by the loss they receive many year of diverse both of their people and camel yet so commodious be their trade and follow with such great diligence and government that among themselves none be admit but principal person and by especial order without entertain any other nation what respect or familiarity so ever they have gain among they this in effect have be the sole ground to attain unto that knowledge which I presume here to write for my country service wherein duty especial require i to manifest the care and diligence of those noble and worthy gentleman who be the ground and original of this hopeful work unto who these my labour as their own proper right be dedicate who virtue aim at good action in this our bless and peaceful time and cessation from those sea affair they be wont to be bufy in summon they up to in choir and make search after the goldn hope and upon good ground conferance with such principal merchant of Barbary as their wisdom can make choice of attain some better satisfaction to their former knowledge of the Moor of marchandize as I light have touch before wherein their practice and true understanding in the mathematics assure they the moor unknown travail must be to the south-west if other way our quotidian trade into all and every part of the mediterrane sea must needs have have some or other intelligence and therefore unite themselves together conclude upon a lawful and warrant-able course to undergo the search of this the king majesty letter patent golden trade by the south-part and to adventure upon those promise river that fall into the main ocean on the south-west side wherein it now require I shall brief relate the manner of their proceed in the year 1618. in the month of September they set forth a ship call the Catherine burden 120. tun and in she employ on George Thompson a man about fifty year of age who have live many year a merchant in Barbary the carcazon of good he carry with he amount unto 1856 f. 19 s. 2 the first voyage have his instruction from the governor and company to enter in the river of Gambra and with such shallop as he have and be think convenient for he to follow his trade and to discover up the river leave the ship in a secure harbour all which in his part be careful perform in his absence through the overmuch trust of our english heart and fair familiarity we use to all nation with who we be in amity the ship be betray and every man leave in she his throat cut by a few poor deject portugese the ship take by the vagrant Portugal and the man slay and Melatos who they give free recourse aboard be only banish people and for the most runnagado from their country as when I come more particular to write of they will more fit be deliver Thompson upon intelligence be get far uppe into the river and find the inhabitant to use he courteous with the king allowance of the country seat himself upon the land and through the kindness of the inhabitant near those part where the ship be lose some of the english who come down from Thompson where safe convey many day travail over land until they find mean to meet with ship to transport they home with their woeful tiding whereupon the noble adventurer with all expedition set forth a pinnace of fifty ton call the s. John and in she a new supply of good and direction to Thompson either for his repair withal his company home the second voyage or as he do affect his trade or have hope of his discovery to make use of those good and abide there he utter refuse to come away and therefore send away the s. John who for that they come in a unseasonable time which then experience make they understand and through some other abuse which more convenient else where I shall set down which loss of many of her man return and as little comfort of gain to the adventurer only hopeful letter from Thompson invite they to a new supply and by the next season to send unto he a ship and pinnace with some especial commodity he make mention of confident affirm they shall no way doubt of a hopeful discovery where the moor of Barbary trade and a valewable return for their loss sustain promise in the mean time which such company as he have leave with he be in all only eight person in his small boat to search up the river which he attempt in a pair of oar take only two of his own company with he the rest people of the country which who he pass up the river and get to Tinda a place he aim at in hope to have have conference with a black merchant call Buckor Sano of who I shall have cause to speak in the relation of my own travail fail of he for that he be then in his travail within the land he stay not many hour above howbeit in that time he receive such intelligence of the trade he look after that such a ecstasy of joy possess he as it be and have be allege against he that grow more peremptory than he be wont and seem to govern with more contempt by a quarrel fall out among they one of his company captain Thompson slay slay he to the utter loss of what he have attain unto who in regard of emulation in strive to keep other he affect not in ignorance commit nothing to paper so as all his endeavour and labour be lose with he these thing I have presume to write that it may appear what rub have be in the infancy of this discovery and may partly make answer to the question may be propound by any that shall be please to read over my ensue discourse why so hopeful and promise a business shall be neglect and now I return to the worthy adventurer who little distrust this mishap not withstand Thompson be slay in march whereof they can have no intelligence in October after be a convenient season set forth again a ship and pinnace the ship call the Zion burden 200. ton and the s. John a pinnace of 50 ton the three voyage in this ship it please they to employ i the present writer and now what do ensue of this discourse be write from i either as a eye witness or what I have receive from the country people and none but such as be of esteem and as my confidence assure will deliver no false thing as where I come to speak of the black people in particular may be more apt conceive the 25. of October 1620. we set sail from dart-mouth the 4. of November when the day appear we be up with the island of Launcerot and the next day by noon past the canary island and have lay all that land the 17. of November we come to a anchor in the river of Gambra have have some occasion of stay by the way to the loss of near three day so as our the whole way from England to the river run in 20. day whole travail from dart-mouth thither be in 20. day we anckor some four league within the mouth of the river and to avoid inconvenience by intermingle one thing with another to set down each particular as they present themselves I have think it most acceptable to the reader to divide my discourse into particular head the more apt to be understand wherein I think it fit to begin with the particular handle in this book the description of the river with the limit and bound thereof so far as we have scene likewise what opinion experience make i hold for the continuance thereof and how necessary it be to be search into for advance the golden trade with a relation what we find live therein which may serve for sustenance and maintain the traveller next the several sort of people inhabit upon the land blackman alias mandingo or ethiopian fulby and the vagrant port all with the manner of their life building and fortification the state of their king and the title of other commander and their manner of life the government of the mary-buck or bissareas the discourse of their religion and separation from the rest and course of trade and therein speak of their lulietto or merchant with the relation of my meeting with Buckor Sano a great black merchant and commerce with he their juddy or fiddler and manner of meeting with the discourse of circumcision and report of their devil Ho-re what manner of trad be among the common people their order for till the ground and several sort of grain and other plant in use among they and therewith a ample relation of the time and season of the year when those great storm of thunder and lightning with abundance of rain do fall the unwholsomens of the air in those time and what natural reason may be all edge as well for those contagious time as also to avoid the inconvenience that have former by most of our nation be fall unto again what variety of wild beast aswell offensive and ravenous as also such as be for the sustenance and comfort of those as travail we find the country replenish with thereunto adjoin what land foul be likewise there the abundance of both which kind be always at hand to mend the diet of any ingenious looker out and with a brief conclusion from myself I shut up my discourse unto which several I now proceed and first to the river the description of the river this river whereof I now take in hand by God grace to write be situate in the latitude of 13 degree and @ by all or the most part of map and card and by some call by the name of Gambia by other gamba and by another sort set down Gambra to which latter name be most frequent I do apply myself for by the natural inhabitant either below in the mouth of it neither it above to the far I have travel be upon the true account I can keep some 320 league or 960 mile can I ever hear any proper name but only the word gee which in their language they use to all river and water it have one sole entrance which in the very mouth be about some 4 league broad and in the channel 3 fathom water at the least without any bar contrary to the set of it former forth where it be general note to have a bar and much sholer water than we have find after we be run some 4 league in it do spread itself into so many river bay and creek that for the space of some 30 league unto a town call Tauckro valley it be so intricate that many month may be spend to search each particular within that limit but for that my occasion of writing be ground upon the great hope and expectation that be from above I intend not to make any stay there but refer what be to be say until I speak of the inhabitant only as I proceed to let you know that the main channel be not to be mistake except within the limit aforesaid and then also through great neglect or rather some wilful ignorance thus with a fair stream this brave river shoot in flow from his mouth into the land near upon 200 league unto a town call Baraconda or some little above and that be the uttermost bound of his flow even in the low season of the year for as in all river run into the sea the increase of the inland water occasion by reins or snow do abate of the sea in draught so much more in this great river who swell upright 30 foot observe one due time and season of the year for ever must the sea force in those swell time be mighty drive back whereby a certain knowledge be attain which be the settle time to be follow eamest to meet with no impediment in pass up which impediment be only want of water to pass over flat which in the low season of the year in certain place be meet withal as be common see in all river of such mighty inlet which bank as it be be past present a fair passable river continue for many league and as we expect our season of winter and summer so do these inhabitant these time of flood occasion by abundance of rain which rain always proceed forth of the southeast and have their beginning much soon in the inland then at the river mouth so as in those part where we have have abode they begin to fall in the latter end of May and at the these be all more large write of where the tillage of the ground be handle river mouth not until the end of june these reins continue very violent for three month come down with great wind and very much thunder and lightniug not perpetual but as we say in sudden gust and storm the violence whereof be overpass the people continue their labour as where I write of their manner of tillage be more large set down as also a more free description of these contagious time the increase of the river likewise in the begin of the year before any rain be see to fall where we abide do make it propable that rain wasfallen within the land before we taste any all which affirm the great inlet of this hopeful river and give a assurance that it be passable if time and season be observe and with diligence follow with boat and vessel fit according as experience in travel it already so far may some way warrant a sufficient director next to show a continuance of this great stream when we have row beyond the ebb and flow and 12. day against the currant which we travail in the month of january when the water be at the low of his nourishment and then the shoal we meet withal and stop our further proceed have 9 inch water which shallowness continue not above to yard wherein if we have we be 10 of our own company that go up in a shallop and 4 black that I hire to carry up a Canoe be a able company together be only 10. of we and likewise have have provision of tool wherewithal and be assure of a trade and so friendly a people to converse withal as after we find any encouragement will have make we work a gut through that little distance and be past that place the river show himself again with fair promise so far as we bad occasion to look near a league and how far he may so continue we be ignorant and in those place above do we see sea-horse whosenature require deep water as where I write at large of he you may better perceive likewise the high still more store of crocodile which add encouragement of the largeness of the river and likewise a fair breadth between the shore I follow these probability to encourage the far search of the river which diligent follow may even in one season give a full satisfaction to the forward adventurer and if it so fall out we can meet with any town above stand by the river side it will assure prove a commodious place to make our abode in to take the advantage of the seasonable time and to make return to and again as experience must lead to the great advantage and for trade there be no question but a marvellous recourse will be unto we which be already testify in that so many hundred of they come down unto we to the remote place where we be enforce to stay build they house of read on both side the shore and the recourse still more and more increase in so much as we have intelligence the people be come from a great town call Iaye in their language and we do conceive it to be Gago if we have be furnish with commodity enough for they and likewise know the seasonable time for our passage in the these (...) river and convenient harbour for our safe abode and why may not the town they call Mumbar which they say be but 6. day journey from the place we stay at according to their travail which in the discourse of the people laster lie down belikewise upon the river if so how great a advantage may it bring unto we if we be mind to stay there when the Moor of Barbary come for at this town the caravan from Barbary do stay and abide we know their whole trade be for gold but what quantity they have here or what people it be they trade withal we be as yet ignorant and this adventure up the river will undoubted discover that the gold be there we be assure of have batter and have trade for some and upon trial the same in goodness that Barbary afford our country have the river to friend we shall be able though but few of we to defend ourselves from the rage of the Barbary Moor if he shall attempt any thing against we for undoubted when he shall see we enter into his trade he will appose what may be to affront we and although I have be promise safe defence by the country people yet a boat be a certain retreat and the river a constant friend to trust unto again what know we whither the river may bring we within the confine of those people who will not be see and be those to who our salt do pass of who in the relation of the country in his place as it follow I write and if it be as in all description that be set out it be lay down that the river of Senega and this river do meet yet can be in any probability but a few day journey above the place and hey we have already be at must needs reach to it and no doubt afterward that which afford two such branch must contain within himself a fair and promise stream which may take head from some great and large lake above such as be describe to be about Gago and if any such place shall be find what use or profit may arise can but promise a hopeful expectation and last if the inhabitant above be enemy among themselves as we see in the mouth of the river and hear likewise of they what advantage our force in the river may work will easy be consider in regard they have not the use of any the country people have no boat or canoe above the ebb and flow boat above where it ebb and flow so far as we have hitherunto be which be about 120. league or 360. mile which we be travel as I have say before only 12. day wherein be to be understand we labour not the whole day but set forward so soon as it be day light we contain work until 9 or 10. of the clock we labour to get up the river only 7. hour in 24. rest the heat of the day and again from 3. until the evening shut in and not at all in the night when it be cool and convenient for avoid of tree sink rock and shoal which in the day time we can see and have now take notice of and perfect write down that upon any second attempt we may be much bold and thereby ask lesser time for performance how beit our return downward for those 12. day travail be in 6. and God be praise both go come and stay there without sickness or loss of any one man nay more to our great comfort we find the high we go the more healthful our body and it be likely if town be find again near no town near the river side after we pass the ebb and flow the river they do so continue for from Baraconda whither the river flow we never hear nor see of any town or plantation nor recourse of any people unto we but what we send for neither show of any boat only some two or three bundle of Palmeta leave we find bind uptogether which our black will tell unto we some of the people have make shift to pass the river upon so as our passage then must needs afford more discouragement to the actor than any that can by God grace happen hereafter for we be discourage that the people above be of a bad condition if we can pass unto they which the inhabitant hold as impossible in regard they do affirm the river be full of tree sink and drift we shall meet withal and our time in pass be uncertain our provision which be small may fail we and poor God know we be provide of those material that will have help to maintain that principal in respect the place and way afford it and what experience hereafter can direct in that kind to do which be good comfort and encourager to the adventurer I will not by any mean leave unwritten there be abound in this river who be breed and live therein two sort especial as I may term they monstrous the one devour as the people report and the other dangerous as I have find the devour be the crocodile or Alegatha because they carry one and the same resemblance but the description of the crocodile who the country people call Bumbo doubtless I be persuade there be no other crocodile but such as we have see in this river who the people call by the name of Bumbo sundry time when we have drive they from the shore where they have be lie in the morning or otherwise forth of the water when we have observe the print they leave behind they upon the foft sand we have find by measure of rule his whole length from the point of his nose to the end of his tail contain thirty three foot the people of the country stand in such dread of these that they dare not wash their hand in the great river much less offer to swim or wade therein report how the people do fear he unto we many lamentable story how many of their friend and acquaintance have be devour by they neither do they at any time bring any of their cattle to pass the river as within ebb and flow they have diverse occasion to do but with great dread and ceremony for at all town within that compass they have small boat which we call canoe to ferry over withal which can receive a live beef only some five or six of the people but when they pass a beef over he be lead into the water with a rope to his horn whereby one hold he close to the boat and another take up his tail hold in the like manner the priest or mary-buck stand over the middle of the beast pray and spit upon he according to their ceremony charm the crocodile and another again by he with his bow and arrow ready draw to expect when the the manner they pass their cattle over the river for foare of Bumbo crocodile will cease and in this manner if there be twenty at a time the pass they one after another never think they safe until they be on the top of the river bank one thing more to show the fear they have of he when I be go in my discovery up the river have as I say only nine of our own people with i I do hire Blacke-men as I have occasion to use they to serve as interpreter likewise to send abroad and to help to row and get up the boat so that when I come to pass the flow and to go all against the currant I do furnish myself of four able blackman the first place we find a stiff gut to resist we the water be not above four foot deep for speedy and more easy pass our man go into the water and lay hand some one the one side of the boat and some likewise on the other wade along and lead she through which we find a good refresh the river be sweet and clear be comfortable in the heat by no mean I can not make any of my black people go out of the boat deny flat to go into the water say that Bumbo will have they after some the black will not go into the river two of these age there be another straight where be a necessity of more hand so that stripe myself I leap into the water the black see i prepare seem much to dissuade i but when they see i in the water they present consult together strip themselves and come likewise in the business end and we all aboard again I ask of they the cause make they come in have so earnest deny it before they make answer they have consider among themselves the white man their answer when they go in shine more in the water than they do and therefore it Bumbo come he will sure take we first so that after they never refuse to go in yet in all our whole passage do we never receive any assult but to the contrary where we have see great company of they lie upon the sand they have perpetual avoid we with the same shine that snake do use to avoid the noise and sight of man here only bold to show himself where the water be deep and the black people do not stick to say that since the white man have have to do in the river the crocodile be not so dangerous as in former time again whereby it do appear they be more abundant above whereas he do natural smell exceed sweet after the manner of musk so as in all place where they use to come one shore they leave a send behind they that many time we be not able to receive but enforce to stop our nostril some three day before we come to the high place we stay at we begin to find the river water which be our daily drink to change his relish the strong send of the crocodile change the taste of the river water and the fish be take in it but after we come there it have such a sweet musky taste that we not only refuse to drink of it but also can not endnre our meat to be dress therewith but seek out spring and fresh upon the land nay more those great fish which with our hook we take in that place lose the savour they have below and do taste and relish as the crocodile smell that we utter refuse to eat they ourselves but bestow they upon the people of the country which receive they thankful land likewise the cry and noise of they in this place be more than we have hear all the way for the noise he make be resemble right to the sound of a deep great well with which the great one call one to another and may be distinct hear a league which sure argue the continuance of this hopeful river and that some great lake above may be the nourisher of they the other be the sea-horse who in this river do wonderful abound and for that the name of sea-horse be a common word in regard of the greene-land voyage where they use the same to the sea-mosses they kill there who be of contrary the desctiption of the sea-horse shape I think it fit to describe this fish or beast or what I may call he because questionless there be never beast nor any thing in that kind set forth to show in these our country that will produce more admiration he be in fashion of body a complete horse as round buttocked as a horse of service and in his whole body answerable his head like unto a horse with short ear but palpable appear which he wag and stir as he show himself only towards his mouth he grow broad down like a bull and have two tooth stand right before upon his low chop which be great and dangerous in regard he strike with they his cry or neigh direct like a great horse and have in the same manner four leg answerable to his body whereupon he go and wherewith he likewise swim as a horse do yet in these be his great difference for they be somewhat short in proportion than horse be and where they shall be round hoofte it divide itself into five paw upon every which he have a hoof the whole foot contain a compass of great breadth as the beast be in growth insomuch as I have take the measure of some print they leave where they walk of twenty ynche over his manner of feed likewise resemble the horse for although he live all day in the river yet every night he go due on shore in diverse place feed upon their rice and corn do the country people much spoil but his general feed be upon low marish ground where the grass or sedge be the sea-horse feed in the night upon the shore green to which they resort in great company and in those reach of the river which have deep water and lie near and convenienst to such manner of ground do we always find great store in some place they go a mile from the shore side to their feed have track that be beat as hard and palpable as London high way he return by the break of day to the river where he be very bold when our boat come by he will hold his head above the water many time store of they together and so near as within pistol shoot snort neigh and toss the water make show of great displeasure and sometime attempt it for in my passage too and again in the river my boat be strike by they three time and one of the blow be very dangerous for he strike his tooth quite through which I be enforce a dangerous blow by a sea-horse with a great deal of diligence to stop or it have danger our sink but the hazard of they may be well avoid if man be provide to shoot at they when they press overbold which we can not do in regard out allowance of powder be small and we be drive to put it to other use neither have we a neglect to be hereafter careful provide for piece according through the neglect of some ill wish person who deceive the trust the worthy adventurer oppose upon they in the night while we have candle burn some of they disturb by we will remain in the river and will come stare up the stream snore and press near upon we but we find mean to send they pack for break a small piece of wood we will stick a short candle light upon it and let it drive with the stream upon they from which they will fly and make way with a great deal of horror and one note we observe among they they werealwaye most dangerous when they have their young with they which they sometime leave on shore but be in the water every female carry her young upon her back so as when she put up her head the young head likewise will look his share and where they appear many head together there be asmuch variety as from the great horse to the hunt nag the sea-horse we find great store when we be likewise past the flow of the tide and continue above the high place we be which still argue a large and constant river the people do account the country people esteem the sea-horse for excellent meat of these for a excellent meat not resuse to eat they if they be take up dead in the river as they be many time find swim howsoever they come kill howbeit I conceive the crocodile and they agree for that I have stand upon the bank and see they swim one by another without offence have speak of these I now return to matter of sustenance which the river afford there be variety of good fish among which great store of mullet if man have net and provision to take they which in some place within the ebb and flow the shore lie convenient to make use of and above that in most place howbeit we never make use above any place where our ship rid who always keep the net with she wherewith we make diverse draught most especial at a town call cassan and against which the ship do ride and be the high place in the river she go where our convenientst draw be close to the town and when the people at any time see we bring our net on the shore and provide to fish as the net come near the shore they will come rude in and many time with their uncivilnes endanger the break and spoil of our net with their greediness to lay hold on the fish that we be enforce to speak unto the king dwell in the town to command they to forbear trouble we promise when we have take for our own present use and reserve some for he the residue shall be take out and remain among they and his command be give they be careful to observe it among the rest one time have make a draught we have not such plenty as usual only some fish in the cod of the net which be take up be shake into a basket stand in the boat with which we row aboard and the basket be hand in as the custom be the fish be pour upon the deck whereof many rude sailor will be their own carver among which fish there be one much like unto our english bream but of a great thickness which one of the sailor think for his turn think to take away put therefore his hand unto he so soon as he touch the fellow present cry out he have lose the use both of his hand and arm another stand by say a strange operation of a fish what with touch this fish and in speak put thereto his foot he be barelegged who present cry out in the like manner the sense of his leg be go this give other of better rank occasion to come forth and look upon they who perceive the sense to come again call up for the cook who be in his room below know nothing what have happen and be come wild he to take that fish and dress which he be a plain staid fellow orderly stoop to take up as his hand be on he sink present upon his hinder part and in the like manner make grievous moan he feel not his hand which breed a wonderful admiration among we from the shore at the same time be come a Canoe aboard we in which be a black man call sandie who in regard he have some small knowledge of the Portugal tongue have great recourse among we we bring he to the fish and show it unto he upon sight whereof he fall into a laughter and tell we it be a fish they much fear in the water for what he touch he numb his nature be to stroke himself upon another fish who present he likewise num'b and then pray upon he but bid we cut of his head and be dead his virtue be go and he very good to eat at this place only we shall see many moor sport play and come bold into the water a good distance from the shore where lay a sandy bank but they never go beyond their height and they will tell we there be a blessing grant to that place by some great mary-buck that Bumbo shall never hurt they and on that side the town stand as our ship do ride in the middle of the river and we have observe we never see any crocodile but on the contrary side many time very great one and this be assure true for variety sake I have place here in the upper part of the river there be store of fish and more convenient to be come by if man go provide among which we note one little fish the run fish which may well be call the run fish and be much like our english roach with a red tail who be enforce to run above the water and will continue a great way but only touch of it to save his life from his pursue enemy who come chap after he just like the trout after the fly and be of that bigness the trout be that sometime the little fish have run into our Canoe to avoid the pursuer likewise of foul the high we go we find plenty and much variety but this we have ever observe that in the main river we never see they swim but as they be in the nature of the river foul shoal together be they duck and mallard or any other in their kind they sit upon the shore close to the river side and dare not sure venture in for fear of the crocodile but have their principal feed upon the marish ground and pond which lie from the river whereof the country be very full and you can find no such place but be abundant furnish among which be many goose of colour white and black rather big than our english tame goose who have upon each pinion of his wing a sharp spur in every point resemble a cock spur of the large size with which they be apt not be shoot dead to give offence but for foul that live natural by the shore side as heron corlews stork pluffer and the like it do yield plenty so that whosoever shall go up well furnish of piece and powder shall be sure to mend their fare and light upon many a dainty dish the people of the country have likewise diverse ware which they make use of in the time of reins and when the river be over-floude at which time they kill much fish and they have also a strange manner of fish in their lake and pond of which there be many that be very broad and contain much circuit but be not deep to which they resort the manner of the people fish as they desire to fish a whole town or plantation together only the man every one have a kind of basket with the mouth open which he hold downward and so go into the water close on by another they over spread the pond whereby the fish be move and so clap down the mouth of their basket before they they hit upon the fish and in this manner they take so many that most of they go load home and if at any time we be near those place they will love impart they to we upon return from we of poor value these thing which now we know and can tell how to provide for may serve as encouragement to proceed upon a far discovery but in that which follow concern the love of the people what trade we already have find and what relief they bring we and at what rate as also what dear and wild cattle the land afford throughout with such variety of land foul and other necessary whereof in their due place I mean to speak I hope as I desire may be some furtherance to invite adventurer to advise of some few day search further into this hopeful river wherein the very river if we have nothing else to friend prove but as we have hitherunto sound it will afford that comfortable relief man need not stand in dread of starve which consider and the probable good that may and will rise in obtain the golden trade I conclude it most necessary to follow diligent a far search for which if I shall be thereunto require in place convenient I can yield some other special account which for some respect I forbear to publish and follow my order proceed to the inhabitant the several inhabitant etc. to speak of the country and the inhabitant I take my beginning from the mouth of the river whereat our first entrance we find the black man call mandingo and that they do continue among themselves still one and the self same language those of they who be inhabit or dwell in the mouth of the river or within certain league of the first entrance be very fearful to speak with any ship except they have perfect knowledge of they in regard they have be many time by several nation surprise take and carry away but upon some knowledge they will resort to the shore near unto we and bring with they beef goat hen and abundance of Bonanos in the west indies call plantano a most excellent good and wholesome fruit likewise of their country pease and other grain and in way of tradesome hide they there alone have the domination their king and governor be their seat as in the upper part of who especial my discourse be intend howbeit for the more plain proceed I must break of a while from they and acquaint you first of another sort of people we find dwell or rather lurk among these maudingo only some certain way up the river and these be as they call themselves Portugese and some few of they seem the same other of they be molatoes between black and white but the most part as black as the natural inhabitant they be scatter some two or three dweller the vagrant Portugal in a place and be all marry or rather keep with they the country black woman of who they beget child howbeit they have amongst they neither church nor friar nor any other religious order it do manifest appear that they be such as have be banish or flee away from forth either of Portugal or the isle belong unto that government they do general employ themselves in buy such commodity the country afford wherein especial they covet the country people who be sell unto they when they commit offence as you shall read where I write of the general government all which thing they be ready to vent unto such as come into the river but the black people be buy away by their own nation and by they either carry or sell unto the Spaniard for he to carry into the west indies to remain as slave either in their mine or in any other servile use they in those country put they to some few of these sort themselves together in one time of the year have use to go up this river in a boat or small bark as far as Setico and there to remain in trade from whence it be certain know they have return much gold above which place they never attempt which be not half the way we have already go up since our trade there with these in their place of dwell we be very conversant notwithstanding we receive such a horrible treachery from they as be set down in my beginning in regard they tell we those that be the actor thereof be banish from among they as be hate and detest for the fact howsoever we hope and desire it may stand for all our nation warning never to let they have the like occasion but believe ever they will do as they say in tell a especial caveat we they do love and wish we well provide they may never have we under their power to be able to do we ill which it behoon we to take especial care of the condition they live subject unto under the black king make it appear they have little comfort in any christian country or else themselves be very careless what become of their posterity for whensoever the husband father or master of the family die if he be of any worth the king seize upon what he have without respect either to wife child or servant except they have warning to provide before or be capable of themselves to look out for the future time whereby we find in some those few place we trade with they poor distress child leave who as it be expose to the charity of the country become in a manner naturalize and as they grow up apply themselves to buy and sell one thing for another as the whole country do still reserve careful the use of the Portugal tongue and with a kind of a affectionate zeal the name of christian take it in a great disdain be they never so black to be call a negro and these for the most part be the Portingalls which live within this river who since they see we have follow a trade and begin to settle upon it in regard they much doubt we wait but a opportunity as they say among themselves to have a valuable satisfaction for the wrong their nation begin with know the englishman do not ordinary digest such horrible abuse it have make such as be of worth and dwell upon the coast who be wont to look into the river forbear that recourse and also those that be of the best and most able estate to quit their dwelling and to seek out elsewhere leave none but a few poor snake who for fear rather than love offer themselves to do we any manner of service which fear of they be the more increase because the natural black people out of their moral understanding and be some of they spectator of their bloody murder the ship then ride before the town when the fact be do and by they right understand to be treacherous do in betray our faithful trust contrary to the great protestation and obligement before these inhabitant make and confirm do not only utter disallow of the fact but exclaim against they cause they to forsake their dwelling in that town neither have they at this time any habitation there notwithstanding they have have continuance for many year before and further when some of our people who be above in the river not know of this evil accident and be upon occasion return to the courteous usage of the natural inhabieant the ship who they find so miserable lose and carry away the people of the town especial some principal and most powerful man take such compassion upon they that they feed they and lodge they with a great deal of love care and that for no small time until they have devise and conclude among themselves what course to take and have resolve to take a tedious journey by land in seek to cross the country to the northward until they come to cape Verde where they be sure to meet with ship they not only fit they with such necessary as they can but also of their own people as guide with they and be in that manner commend from one king to another be love entertain lodge and feed and with new guide still convey never leave they until their desire be satisfy and they safe arrive where they find convenient ship and still the commendation that go alongst with they from one black king to another be in regard their ship be betray and take away by the Portugal whereby they find such compassion that in some place they have horse to ride on and in other place be entreat to rest and recreate themselves long than they be willing and thus much be say for those people of the country among who the portingall dwell have their abode and all familiar commerce but for those black people who be dwell above in the river where these portingall never have any habitation only as I say a trade in their boat up some part of the river and amongst who we have settle ourselves with great league and testification of much amity as I must deliver when I come unto they these I say when there be only five of our man dwell among they their house seat by the river side and that ceraine portugese in a smalbark or boat be to pass by they in follow their trade to Setico be a matter of some 16 league above the place our man live at these people when they see our man make ready their arm and prepare their piece to standon their guard be so sew of they not dare to trust the portugese flatter promise do not only put themselves in company for their defence but likewise animate our man to set upon they promise if they will give the ouset they will prosecute it to the confusion of all and every man of they in the same manner as they before have deal with we with great vehemency press they as a thing they be especial bind to do which our man refuse they inthemselue do carry towards they a kind of sullen and insolent behaviour so as their bloody act wherewith they think to daunt and discourage we in seek or follow of any trade here and more secure to settle themselves have no doubt by God providence if it be careful consider and diligent observe by a timely the reward of treachery follow of what do offer itself turn to the clean contrary and through their own guilt enforce they to avoid the place leave it of their own accord whereby if we embrace the occasion many good and profitable end may be make and this have I true relate the Portugal who as he see we prepare with earnestness to follow this trade with the like earnestness will prepare to leave the river which preparation as I hope and desire may speedy and earnest in our country behalf be under go and follow so in his preparation I will be no hinderer but think it a fair riddance of a false friend and so I leave he the wander Fulbie there be one people more dwell and abide among these maudingo and under their subjection of who it be necessary for i to speak before I come to the principal these be call fulby be a tawny people and have a resemblance right unto those we call egyptian the woman among they be straight upright and excellent well body have very good feature with a long black hair much more loose than the black woman have wherewith they at ire themselves very neat but in their apparel they go clothe and wear the same habit the black woman do the man be not in their kind so general handsome as the woman be which may be impute to their course of life whereof I proceed to tell you their profession be keep of cattle some goat they have but the herd they beef whereof they be abundant store in some place they have settle town but for the most part they be still wander unite themselves in kindred and family and so drive their herd together where they find the ground and soil most fit for their cattle there with the king allowance of the country they sit down build themselves house as the season of the year serve and in such place as lie most convenient for preservation of their herd they look unto during the time of the reins they retire to the mountain and high ground and again as they grow dry and barren to the low plain and bottom even to the river side that in the time of our chief trade their cattle be feed by we and the woman with their commodity daily customer to we these man labour and toil be continual for in the day time they watch and keep they together from stray and especial from come to near the river where the crocodile do hawr and in the night time they bring they home about their house and part they in several herd they make fire round about they and likewise in the middle of they about which they lie themselves ready upon any occasion to defend they from their roar enemy which be lion ounce and such devour beast whereof the country be full as when I speak of they will be perceive this be the poor fulbies life whereunto he be so enure that in a manner he be become bestial for I have note diverse time when we have come up in the morning before his cattle have be disperse or go to seed when we have call for the mr or chief of they to make a bargain for a beef or beef as we have occasion he will come unto we from forth the middle of the hear and those part of he which be bare as his face and hand but especial his face will stand so thick of fly as they use to sit in the hot summer time upon our horse and teem here in England and they be the same manner of fly we have which the Fulbie will let alone not offer to put up his hand to drive they away therein seem more senseless than our country beast who will whisk with their tail and seek any other defence to avoid or be rid of they but for our own part we be fain during our parley with they to hoe a green bow to beat of the fly find his stay never so little very offensive these people live in great subjection to the Maudingo under the misery of the fulbic which they seem to groan for he can at any time kill a beef but if they know it the blackman will have the great share neither can he sell or barter with we for any commodity he have but if it be know the other will be his partner in so much as when the man come unto we they will watch the blacke-mans absence or hide their commodity draw we covert to see it that they may have their return private and not stick many time when he know the other out of hear to speak many disdainful word against he and of these people the country be very full be disperse and spread in such manner of family as I say before over the whole country and high up in the country as we here and I shall show hereafter they be in on part principal and have exclude the black hold domination among themselves and for the most part continual in war the language the Fulbie speak be different from the blackman the woman be our chief customer for in most place within the ebb and flow where we do lie for trade we shall be sure to have their custom every day which be to bring we new milk sour milk and curd and two sort of butter the one new and white the other hard and of a excellent colour which we call refine butter and be without question but for a little freshness as good as any we have at home all which they bring unto we in great and small gourd like dish make up very handsome and one thing let i not forget to give they due praise in that in what somever you receive from they you shall have it so neat and clean that in your milk you shall not perceive a mote nor in her butter any uncleanliness nay the gourd ordish they the cleanelines of the Fulby woman bring it in on the very outside will shine with cleanliness and one the inward part without any nastiness and if at any time by any mischance there have be a mote or hair which you have show unto she she will have seem to blush in defence of her cleanly meaning in note of which I have diverse time say there be great difference between they and the irish Calios although their manner of life have great resemblance in follow of their cattle and as they be out of heart in one ground to remove whole town together which but few year since be the irish kern true course of life butwith cleanliness your irish woman have no acquaintance and therefore I return back to my tawny Fulbie the commodity she ask for be small bead and poor knife of 16 d a dozen with other trifle thing but after they once see and va of salt which in their language they call ramdam there be no other thing can so well please they although it be never so little we find the variety of these thing many time agreeable to our nature and therefore give fair recourse unto the people for if we deny but one day to buy of they we shall want their company a week after what earnest occasion soever we have to use they and these thing be to be have from none but they because the Maudingo or blackeman apply himself at no time in keep or preserve of cattle but leave it to this painful Fulby who I likewise leave look to his herd and come to the command black the Maudingo or ethiopian be the natural inhabitant distinguish by the name of the maudingo the people who be lord and commander of this country and profess themselves the natural inhabitant be perfect black both man and woman the man for their part do live a most idle kind of life employ themselves I mean the great part to no kind of trade nor exercise except it be only some two month of the year which be in till and bring home their country corn and grain wherein the preservation of their life consist and in that time their labour be sore as when I come to show the manner you may easy conceive all other time of the year they live wander up and down from one to a other have little understanding either to hunt in the wood or fish in the water notwithstanding both the one and the other in their kind be infinite replenish that to their very door wild beast do resort and about their house in every corner abundance of ginny hen and excellent partridge in the heat of the day the man will come forth and sit themselves in company under the shady tree to receive the fresh air and there pass the time in communication have only one kind of game to recreate themselves withal and that be in a piece of wood certain great hole cut which they set upon the ground betwixt two of they and with a number of some thirty pebble stone after a manner of count they take one from the other until one be possess of all whereat some of they be wondrous nimble we do perceive among they that the ordinary people eat but one meal a day and especial the young sort of what kind soever their hour of feed the time and manner of the people feed be only aster the day light be in and then with fire of reed without the door they sit they round and fall to their viand which for the most part be either rice or some other grain boil which be bring unto they by the woman in goarde hot put in their hand they roll up into ball and cast into their mouth and this be their manner of feed they do seldom eat either flesh or fish the rather because they can get it than out of any will to refuse it and although they be great breeder of such very poultry as eat our cock and hen and have understanding to cut capon yet they be great sparer thereof and preserve they to sell unto we for small piece of iron bead and such like commodity whereof if we be furnish we can want none of that provision they will say their feed so seldom be a great preservation of their health and at that time when the sun be down a fit time for nourishment avoid especial to eat in the heat of the day as a thing wonderful unwholesome wherein it may please you to give i leave to utter my opinion which happy come to be scan by a digression by the writer for the better preserve of man life and health man of knowledge may produce some rule of better order then have hither-unto be keep amongst our nation which have cause the loss of so many life and the dangerous sickness of other therewithal lay a general scandal upon the country itself to be both infectious and unwholesome for our body whereas indeed it be our own disorder for the custom that have be hither-unto hold especial into this river have be without any diligence to make choice of such seaman for governor as be man of temperance and command who be able to temper well themselves may the better govern the rest who ill carriage may be think to be great provoker for shorten other man day I will example it in this last voyage of we the master be a man know for a excellent artsman but in the government of himself so far from knowledge that after our passage from Dartmouth which be in October until the middle of march after about which time he die it will be justify he be never twenty day sober in which time he go not alone but our chirurgeon with sundry other officer that be of his society with their life pay for their riotous order and further whereas we be divide into two shallop to go up the river the big whereof the principal factor be to follow his trade in and carry therefore in the same a butt of sack and a hogshead of make choice of such man as be the most able and likely body to hold out and he in himself careful enough as his experience may well advise he have spend many year and make many voyage upon that continent to observe both his diet of eat and drink yet towards his people he carry at sometime such a oversparing hand that they fall to practise how they may deceive he make use of all advantage to steal those hot drink from he which be purchase as it be from his niggardly nature they will divide as a spoil with great greediness amongst themselves and thereby wrought their own confusion that of those people he carry with he they either die before he come back to the ship or short after some two at the most except who escape with dangerous sickness whereas to the contrary with thankfulness to God be it speak myself go up in the other shallop and wherein I must take such man as be give i not such as I desire observe among ourselves a love and orderly course of diet wherein every man have his equal share notwithstanding I go one hundred and forty league above the other shallop return without the loss of any one man nay in all my go to the high and in my return to the pinnace I never have any man sick but upon a second return up some part of the river some of my old man be change two or three fell sick howbeit with comfort be it speak there be not one man die that go with i and for my own part through the whole voyage I be never one quarter of a hour sick bless be the name of God now for my opinion concern our diet I hold well with the black that to feed at noon be a unwholesome thing for that the sun be then in his extremity of heat and by his nearness have such power over we the moisture that lie within the body be exhale to the exterior part to comfort the writer opinion concern diet and refresh that which the heat do dry and then be the interior part most cold and unapt for nutriment wherein experience make we see that in the height and heat of the day we can with great facility and without offence drink off such a draught or quantity of or hot water as if we shall drink here in our native country at one time will certain burn out our heart nay more we find our body natural desire and long for the same wherein I may here the cauneat must be look careful to in the set forth show some reason partly to blame a neglect in our own provision but that I assure myself it have be rather ignorance to know what be good then want of will to provide it whereas in the cool of the morning and again in the evening we receive it with much more temperance and a little give satisfaction so that my conclusion be that to we that have able and work body and in our occasion be stir and labour in the morning early and after the heat of the day be the fit and convenientst time to receive our sustenance wherein I shall ever submit myself to those of more able judgement and return to the black let you know that their usual and ordinary drink be either the river water or from some spring howbeit they have grow from tree several sort of wine or drink as also the make of a kind of liquor they call Bullo make and compound of their country corn whereof more convenient elsewhere I shall effectual satisfy you and now go on to show you the manner of their building and fortification they place themselves in their habitation round together and for the most part have a wall though it be but of reed plait and make up together some six foot in height circle and go round their town with door of the same in the night time to be orderly shut some of the house within their wall likewise be make of the same reed the manner of their build but the better sort do build the wall of their house of loam which after it be temper and lay up together carry a kind of red colour with it and do remain with a extraordinary hardness that doubtless as I have careful diverse time observe it will make the most excellent and durable brick in the world the whole country except upon the mountain yield the same earth whereof I will not forget to report one thing which in my opinion deserve admiration we do find in most place hill cast up by ant or emmet which we here call ant-hill some of they twenty foot of height of such compass as will hold or strange antehil contain a dozen man which with the heat of the sun be grow to that hardness as we do use to hide and conceal ourselves in the ragged top of they when we take up stand to shoot at the country dear or any other manner of wild beast the form of their house whether it be loam or reed be always round and the round roof make low ever cover with reed and tie fast to rafter that they may be able to abide and lie fast in the outrageous wind and gust that come in the time of rain for which purpose also they build their house round that the wind may have the lesser force against they and the wall enclose and keep they in be to avoid those raven and devour beast which in the night time range and bustle about wherewith diverse time notwithstanding they be much affright and by make fire and raise cry at midnight to chase and drive they from their mansion dwelling this for the mean town or country village but they have likewise town of force according unto the manner of war they use among they fortify and trench in after a strong and defensible nature whereof they say the country within be full especial where the king be seat the manner whereof we have see in some two or three place whereof I will instance only one which be the town of cassan against which as I say before the ship which be betray do ride and we in our last voyage do make it our high port for our big ship this town be the king seat and by the name of the town he hold his title king of cassan it be seat upon the river side and enclose round near to the house with hurdle such as our shepherd use but they be the town of cassan with the manner of fortification above ten foot high and fasten to strong and able pole the top whereof remain above the hurdle on the inside in diverse place they have room and building make up like turret from whence they within may shoot their arrow and throw their dart over the wall against their approach enemy on the outside likewise round the wall they have cast a ditch or trench of a great breadth and beyond that again a pretty distance the whole town be circle with post and piece of tree set close and fast into the ground some five foot high so thick that except in style or place make of purpose a single man can get through and in the like manner a small distance off again the like defence and this be as they do signify unto we to keep off the force of horse to which purpose it seem to be very strong and available consider what arm and weapon they have in use which in this place be necessary to be know they do usual walk with a staff or javelin in their hand which they call a assegie be a reed of some six foot long the head whereof be a iron pike much like our javeline but most of they very artificial make and full of danger other they have also make to throw like irishman dart with head all barb full of cruelty to the receiver each man likewise about his neck the arm or weapon the people have in use do wear in a bandoleer of red or yellow cloth a short sword of some two foot long with a open handle which sword they make of the iron be bring unto they as you shall hear when I speak of their trade and also the better sort of they do carry their bow in their hand and at their back a case very artificial make which may hold within it some twenty four of their arrow it be the small arrow use by any nation make of a reed about the bigness of a swan quill and some two foot in length there be fasten in the end a small iron with a barb head all which iron be dangerous poison the arrow have neither nock nor feather but be shoot from the bow which be also make of a reed by a flat string or rather stick smooth and make even and fasten to the bow so that the bow and the string be one and the selfsame wood who force be small and therefore the offence lie in the poison which near hand upon their cotton garment may make a entry but to a buff jerkin or any other sleight garment of defence except it be very near can be little offensive we have see of they likewise on horse back the horse be of a small stature bridle and saddle after the spanish fashion each man have his assegie in his hand and upon the right side of his horse a broad buckler hang and this be all the weapon in use among they the king house be in the middle of the town enclose by itself only his wife several house about he to which you can come but as it be through a court of guard pass through a open house where stand his chair empty unlawful for any but himself to sit in by which hang his drum the only instrument of war which we see among they neither be these drum without daily employment for this be their continual custom every night after it seem they have fill their belly they repair to this court of guard make fire both in the middle of the house and in the open yard about which they do continue drum hoop sing and make a heathenish noise most common until the day begin to break when as we conceive deadsleepe take they by which mean sleep one the custom in the night part of the day it make the other part seem short until the time of feed come again otherwise it be do to that purpose in the night to fear and keep away the lion and raven beast from about their dwelling who be at that season range and look out for this manner of course be hold among they not only in their fortify town but also in every particular village and habitation whereof sew of they be without such poor drum they use and if they be yet they continue the custom through hoop sing and use their voice but when it happen muslcke be among they than be the horrible din as I shall signify when I overtake their fiddler but first I be to meddle with matter of state and acquaint you concern their king and governor for so I have promise the better to bring my work together in follow of which I shall entreat your patience to observe with i that the better to distinguish of their government I must divide the country by the river that how soever the river trend which in his wind be sure all point of the compass I shall always call that part which lie to the southward in our entrance the southside and the other the northside of both which side although we have see diverse petty king and other commander to who we pay a kind of poor custom which in the mouth of the river where the Portugal have use be not only great but perremptory demand whereas above it be less and rather take as a courtesy present which moral kindness require all stranger come in the way of amity to begin withal to a principal person than any manner of custom that be as we say exact but how soever both below and especial above it be of that poor quantity it hardly deserve the pain of so long a rehearsal whereby you may be draw to conceit of a great valuation those petty king I say where of I both see have conference and do eat and drink within six several place who have the title of which in their language be the proper name for the king have all reference to their great king who line far from those place on the southside the whole country the great king of Cantore we pass even to the high we go which you must needs conceive to be very spacious have all reference to the great king of Cantore on the northside likewise from the seaside about half the the great king of Bursall way we go up they do acknowledge the king of bursall and after he to the high we go on that side the great king of Wolley these three the great king of Wolley king we hard of but see none of they the report go that they be such as show not themselves abroad but in a manner of pomp and that they be not see to hunt but with great number of horse and especial on the northside whereofdiverse english have be eye witness concern bursall who continual abode be near the seaside these great king be likewise tributary to one great king fat ahove in the land as be report to we whereby some recourse have be unto he there be war between the one side of the river and the other and especial from this king of bursall in so much as the people will tell we if he can have any mean to transport his horse on the far side he will in short time overrun great part of that country the state of the great king we may conjecture at by the observance those small one we see do assume unto themselves and those people they govern perform unto they for there be no man but at his first approach before they where they sit common in their house only upon a mat which be spread upon the ground but present himself with a great deal of reverence in kneel on his knee and come near lay first his hand upon the bare ground and then on the top of his own uncover head many of they take up the dust and lay it upon his barehead which the reverence of the people to the petty king action he use twice or thrice before he come at he where with a great deal of submission he lay his hand upon the king thigh and so retire himself a good distance back and if it chance in any company or resort unto he that there be a mary-buck which be their priest as soon as they have make their manner of salutation they all kneel the religious ceremony of these people down and he fall to pray the substance of his prayer be for the preservation of the king and in the same blessing he to which himself cross his arm and lay his right hand over his left shoulder and his left hand over his right shoulder use the word Amena Amena many time over which signify the same as we say amen or so be it nay more even among the common people when they meet in the high way and be of acquaintance have be absent from one another any distance of time if there be a mary-buck among they they put themselves into a round ring and before any salutation fall on their knee to prayer the king respect unto they again be only nod of his head which be acceptable receive how be it in manner of habit there be between the king and his people little or no manner of difference which may be impute to the necessity of the country because it yield but one only material to make apparel of which be a Cotten wool whereof they plant great field and it grow up as it be our rose bush yield a cod that in his full maturity break in some part and show a perfect white cotton of which you shall find more write when I come to rehearse what tree and plant we find among they now for the manner of their apparel it be soon relate they be for the most part barehead only bedeck or hang over with gregory as they the manner of their apparel be likewise over their body leg and arm which word I will present expound unto you but first tell you their only garment be a shirt and a pair of breech their shirt make down to their knee wide in manner of a sirplace and with great sleave the which when he come to use his bow or arm he roll up and it continue fast at the shoulder his breech be make with so much stuff gather just on his buttock that he seem to carry a cushion and after a manner make he straddle as he go barelegged and without shoe except it be some few of they who have a piece of leather under their foot cut like a shoe-sole button about the great toe and again about the instoppe the Gregory be thing of great esteem among they for the most part they be make of leather of several fashion wondrous neat they be hollow and within they be place and sow up close certain write or spell which they receive from their marybucke whereof they conceive such a religious respect that they do confident believe no hurt can betide they whilst these Gregory be about they and it seem to increase their superstition the marybucke do divide these blessing for every several and particular part for upon their head they wear they in manner of the description of their Gregory which be the arm they receive from their marybucke a cross aswell from the forehead to the neck as from one ear to another likewise about their neck and cross both shoulder about their body round their middle great store as also upon their arm both above and below the elbow so that in a manner they seem as it be lade and carry a outward burden of religious blessing whereof there be none so thorough lade as the king although of all sort they be furnish with some both man and woman and this more I have take notice of that if any of they be possess of any malady or have any swell or sore upon they the remedy they have be only by place one of these bless Gregory where the grief lie which they conceit will help they and for aught I can perceive this be all the physic they have among they and they do not only observe this for themselves but their horse do usual wear of these about their neck and most of their bow be hang and furnish with they to countenance his state he have many time two of his wife sit by he support his body and lay their hand upon his naked skin above the waist stroke and gentle pull the same wherein he seem to receive content and because I have name two of his wife before I proceed to any thing else I will acquaint you with the manner of their woman the multiplicity of the number of their wife their wife and the wonderful great subjection they live under the king have a orderly allowance of seven woman which be call wife that be which be esteem and acknowledge and with a settle ceremony among they distinguish from other woman which he have use of be absolute tie to attend his only pleasure and therefore in relate of they according to our proper phrase can give they no other title but wife of which it seem he can exceed the number of seven for he have the use of other woman who be not of that esteem but rather as we may term they concubine who be of a low birth than his wife and these likewise be tie unto he but allowance of other woman for necessity sake not with that manner of strictness the other be so as it may appear they be rather take for necessity then that it be a settle course among they which word necessity I must better explain and therefore tell you that it may and do diverse time fall out that of his seven wife he have none to accompany he in the nature of a wife for undoubted these people original spring from the race of Canaan the son of Ham who discover his father Noah secret for which Noah awake curse Canaan as our holy scripture testify the curse as by schoolman have be dispute extend to his ensue race in lay hold upon the same place where the original cause begin whereof these people be witness who be furnish with such member as be after a sort burdensome unto they whereby their woman be once conceive the reason of that necessity with child so soon as it be perfect discern accompany the man no long because he shall not destroy what be conceive to the loss of that and danger of the bearer neither until she have bring up the child to a full and fit time to be wean which every woman do to her own child be she allow in that nature the man society so that many time it fall out he have not a wife to lie withal and therefore as I say bath allowance of other woman for necessity sake which may seem not over-strange unto we in that our holy writ do make mention thereof as you may read in the 23. chap. of the prophet Ezechiel where and Samaria be call by the name of the two sister Aholah and Aholibah be charge with fornication be in the twenty verse of the same chapter say to dote upon those people who member be as the member of asle and who issue be like the issue of horse therein right and ample explain these people and for the chastity of the wife their law and custom be in that kind very severe for be strict punishment for unchastity take or find a offendor both she and the man she shall offend withal be without redemption sell away in this sort they punish all great offence put none at all to death and such as these be the people the Portingalls buy and ttansport for the west indies as before I show you and this be the course hold among they all howbeit the man buy then wife every man can have so many wife but according as he have mean to keep they and wherewithal to buy they for first every man must compound or have the king or chief covernors consent for any wife or wife he shall take to who he must give some gratification and next he do buy with some commodity the woman of the widow buy their husband herfriend and what he give do remain as we say in bank if he shall die which she have for her better maintenance or if she please to buy a husband for as every man when he take a maid must buy she so every widow if she will have a husband must buy he through which occasion of buy the woman may be conjecture they yield themselves to that subjection but whence soever it grow I be sure there be no woman can be under more servitude for first they do in mortar with such great staff we call coole-stave the subjection of the woman beat and cleanse both the rice and all manner of other grain they eat which be only woman work and very painful next they dress both that and all other manner of victual the man do eeate and when it be so order they do bring and set it down upon the Matte before they present withdraw themselves and be never admit to sit and eat with they nay I can confident affirm that notwithstanding I have eat sundry time both at the king and other man house where the man and we have put our hand in a gourd and feed together yet never can I see any woman allow to eat albeit I have earnest entreat the same for among their many wife there be none of they but have one especial account of which have a great privilege by be about he and more conversant than the rest which by we though stranger be easy discern and therefore among we we call she his hand wife to who we use always to be more free in those no outward dalliance see among they gift we bestow yet this wife be not allow to eat in sight but in another house although she be privilege of many other labour neither be the man ever scene to use any manner of familiar dalliance with they insomuch as I think there be hardly a strange report any Englishman can say he ever see the blackeman kiss a woman again which be to be note notwithstanding this partiality of affection and so many of they of a equality live together it be never hear that they do brawl or scold or fall out among themselves how beit it may be think in matter that near concern they they can choose but have many aggreevance contrary to our english proverb that say two woman in one house etc. but there indeed I will make answer that although they have recourse all day together in his great or more spacious haunt yet for the night every woman have a several house whether she retire herself to give attendance as his desire shall lead he and as they appear before he in the morning their salutation be upon their knee lay their hand upon his thigh and last for her apparel it be loose clothes particoloured blue and white of the same cotton stuff the man wear whereof the woman common we be but one tuck about their middle and from the waste upward bare in regard they be for the most part wrought or rather printed upon the back especial in the high part we be at insomuch as we have see some of they with work all over the woman clothing their back resemble right the print lid and cover which we see lay and set upon our bake meat whereof it appear they take extraordinary pride because they will turn themselves we shall take notice of it and be very well please we shall touch or handle it as a matter to be esteem or set by otherwise they cast another like cloth as they wear below upon their shoulder which hang loose and those be their garment and without question many or the most part of they very chary or nice in show of their secrecy and to conclude concern woman which the country use they serve in marriage the man do common bespeak the woman while she be young and not of ability which be do and confirm the manner of take away their wine which in some sort be use in Ireland at this day by the friend consent yet when the time of her full age be come or afterward as they agree among they the man get his friend which be all the youth and young sort of man he can procure come to the town where the maid be dwell in the begin of the night when the moon shine and as it be by violence lift she up among they and carry she away who make a noise skrike and cry out which be second by the other young maid of the place and thereupon the modesty of a new marry woman the young sort of man that be dweller in the place gather themselves together and as it be in rescue of she while the other with great shout and cry of rejoice carry she quite away to his place of abode where she remain unseen for a certain time and when she do come first forth for certain moon she do not show her open face but with a cloth cast over her head cover all but one eye after the manner of the spanish veil observe herein a shamefast modesty not to be look for among such a kind of black or these people stand much upon their dignity barbarous people I proceed again in the state of their king there be no people in the world stand more upon their antiquity and dignity of blood than they do between themselves insomuch as once I have a quarrel grow in my house between one of the king son under who government our habitation be and another black who be a very lusty and able man call boh John unto who for some respect we carry a more kind of extraordinary affection wherein they brave one another concern their dignity of birth the one be better and the other be better insomuch as boh John with his a dangerous quarrel betwixt they hand strike the other in the face and thereupon their weapon be draw and party make on both side danger be like to ensue but call more of my company with a small gun I step betwixt they and make they sever how beit the king son promise to return the next morning and take revenge if he dare abide he which the other promise to do and according notwithstanding all the entreaty I can use will not depart but withal send out for more people who in the morning betimes come into he all of they fit with their country arm and the king son also perform his word for in the morning he come to the river side and call for a boat to pass over bring a live beef with he as a token unto i from his father as he be many time accustom to send and there come likewise with he diverse people and all with arm I be very doubtful some hurt will arise and labour boh John to go away but all I can gain of he be he will only sit down in our yard under the shadow of our house with his people about he and if no wrong be offer he he will not stir nor give no offence and by mean I wrought so with the king son carry he and his company into my house and use they courteous that for that time I pacify they and they part quiet howbeit not without threaten upon another occasion they do distinct know every government who shall be king and how the succession shall hold for in their temporal governement one brother do ever succeed another until the certain knowledge of their king and governor and their sucressor that race be extinct and then the elder brother son begin and likewise they do distinguish of government as they be in age for there be four brother the elder whereof be the great king of Cantore who we never see the second be Summaway king of the next place and he come down and be aboard our boat the three brother be king of the place where our land-dwelling be be a blind man at who house I have sundry time be and the four brother be call by the name of Ferran and have the government of a country where we have much and their title of honour often trade and for the most part keep a factor lie and this notwithstanding he be of great age be the young brother and as any of his brother die they be all to remove still give he the latter place and this may suffice to show their manner of government and for their several title they have only four which be for wherein their riches consist great beggar the king Ferran a second name Ferambra the three and boh John the last every one of these four be in their place commander and governor their great riches consist in have of most slave and from the king to the slave they be all perpetual beggar from we howbeit small matter will satisfy they except it be in for which they sell all thing they have and the king the temporal people great drinker of aquavitae and all will drink until they be stark drink and fall fast asleep so that to describe the life of the king true be that they do eat drink and sleep and keep company with their woman and in this manner consume their time until time consume the life of their king true describe they with their great blood and dignity whereof they so much eesteme and with one example I will rehearse unto you I shall conclude concern their kingly privilege the king of cassan who be dwell in the town as we come up the river with who I speak drink two or three bottle of and have much familiar conference who have live in that place many year howbeit he be a lame man after we return down the river and make stay at that town we find he nothing so merry incline as he be at our go up whereupon demand among some of the rest the reason they tell we he be to be put out of his kingdom inquire the depose of king wherefore they reply there be another to come who have more right than he for say they this be the king son but beget of a base woman such as I describe their concubine to be howbeit the king leave behind he a son who be right bear but very young which child be now come to year crave his rightful inheritance and the king of bursall under who they hold they can not deny but have take order to send he forward so as he be look for every day and indeed the second day after I be go from the town he come thither bring abundance of people with he to who the people of the town resort leave the old king to who notwithstanding the young king send will he to depart and go away with his wife and family before he come or if he^ find he there he shall suffer death which at the first he refuse to do say he will enclose himself in his dwell and die there but upon better advice when he see himself quite forsake he pass himself and wife across the river and leave the town to this young commander who after his entrance our pinnace ride there and be ready to come away he send for the factor to who after some familiar conference he say this town and kingdom have be lose but hereafter you shall see it find again promise at all occasion his friendly assistance but before I leave they it be necessary I shall acquaint you what manner of ceremony do pass betwixt they and we as we meet together the king be common sit on his mat lay on the ground which in our entrance he observe not offer to rise and in regard he have nothing but his Gregory on his head which be fast and can stir we do not use to move our hat or uncover our head when we come to he but draw near the ceremony use betwixt the king and we when first we meet somewhat bend our body we lay our band upon our breast which he also perform to we and when we come near he hold forth his hand we first take hold on the upper part of one another hand next on the lower part and the three time join palm and with a full hand shake one another down we sit by he and after some small parley concern the cause of our come wherein the king part be perform in state whatsoever he speak be relate over by another out go our bottle of which must not be want and a bottle of sack too it be so much the better and call for a small gourd to drink in which be their rich plate I first begin and drink off a cup present both the cup and bottle unto the king the bottle he deliver present to some one of principal regard with he who by his appointment after the king have first drink and he himself not fail of his next turn distribute it to the whole attendance who for the most part stand round by the wall of the house one after another take his cup and then to the king again in their drink I observe one thing that in regard of the goodness or the strangeness of the liquor when he receive he give his chief Gregory drink first the first cup before he drink himself with the same liquor he wet one of his principal Gregory the king many time call for a cup break the square otherwise they never leave until the bottle be out and so all the bottle we bring wherein we have one privilege for after we have taste the first cup which must be of every bottle to secure they of danger we need not unless we please take any more their woman not allow to drink in public although they love it well but shake of our head when they offer a cup it stand for a fair refusal and so pass to another neither do they suffer their woman public to drink among they except some especial respect who may sometime have a cup but even divide it among themselves so long as the bottle will run and their brain hold out which be the true and proper element they delight in I will here in in their heart desire leave they and proceed to a more civil I be sure sober sort of people the discourse of their maribucke or religious man and so by order I be now come to speak of their marybucke or bissareas which we in our language may call religious person or priest of the country the marybucke be separate from the common people both in their habitation and course of life concern who I have with diligence they observe the Levitical Law observe that in their whole proceed they have a wondrous reference to the Levitical law as it be in our holy bible relate the principal whereof they be not ignorant in for they do report and have great knowledge of the old testament concern Adam and Eve who they call Adama and Evahaha talk of Noah flood and of Moses with many other thing our sacred history make mention of their house or dwelling be separate from the common people have their town and land set out in several within themselves wherein no common people have dwell except such as be their slave that work and they marry in their own tribe and breed up their child in their own sect labour for they which slave they suffer to marry and cherish the race that come of they which race remain to they and their heir or posterity as perpetual bondman they marry likewise in their own tribe or kindred take no wine but the daughter of marybucke and all the child they have be nourish and breed up unto the ceremony of their father but for the number of their wife and woman they have the self course that I describe before the marybuck have the same allowance of woman the king or temporal people have among the king and temporal people in the like manner among they every man in his dignity and precedence have more or less wherein there be no sever town but have a principal for better relation whereof I will declare unto you the town and place where there especial or as I may say high priest do dwell the town be call Setico lie from the river side some three mile to this town I go have occasion in follow of our trade to lie with my boat so near as I can come my guide or this Fodee be my Alchade and buy and sell for i conductor be one of my black people I hire call Fodee career who in his profession be a mary-buck and they be for our commodity to be hire and will put their hand to any needful occasion like as any of the temporal sort will do this be the first of the country who ever I entertain and continue with i both up into the high part I go as likewise all the time I follow any trade in the river with who we do agree by the moon how much he be to have which agreement he receive when the moon be end in some commodity of we which he desire the valuation whereof amount unto a poor sum our continuance together have breed such a affectionate league between we that we be unite as people of one place and in those course of trade we follow I do not only ask and require his advice but in most thing allow and follow the same with that mary-buck I have diverse and sundry communication concern their religion wherein many time he will wish that I may once come to converse with their chief man who he call Fodee bram who fodee bram be the chief mary-buck of all the country will as he say give i full satisfaction concern their religious order and be now come to the port of Setico for so we call it he be very importunate I shall go up to see the town and visit this religious person I receive his direction what present it be fit I shall carry he up wherewith furnish take two of our man with i one of they carry a fowl piece on his neck we come to the town but i thing of some of the dweller by the way they have tell we that this Fodee bram be very ill and dangerous sick whereat they seem much to mourn be enter the town and come unto his house I find without many people demand both priest and people wear one manner of apparel of he what they be he tell i they be all as he be marybucke for by their habit they be not to be discern be all clothe in one and the same manner as the common people be I be entreat to sit down under their open shade which be make by the better sort of people on the outside of their house to take the air in and in the mean time my Alchade for by that name my hire mary-buck be call go into his house and in my name present my present acquaint of he that I be the captain and commander of our people whereupon he cause himself to be lift up from his bed or mat whereon he lay sit on the side whereof support and hold up by three of his wife he send out to have i bring unto he and after our salutation past he hold i fast by the hand give i many thanks for that great present he have receive bemone much his sickness hinder he he can not accompany i thereby to show his respect unto i during our conference he cause the chief mary-buck dangerous sick a dinner to be make ready I do conceit he to be dangerous sick for his hand wherewith he hold i do burn with that extremity as the heat give such offence that I wish very willing I may be loose I take notice of those woman who hold he and to every of they give a pewter ring which both from they and he be thankful receive dinner provide he entreat i with my company to pass into another house adjoin which after their country manner be prepare and we have hen and other provision bring in among which one sort of suftenance I never see before nor after in the country which be compound of their country grain his manner of entertain i make up in round cake resemble very much our english jelly and as our alchard tell i be one of the principal dainty esteem among they while I be at dinner a messenger come from he bring word he be very sorry to hear I feed not and likewise by he send unto i a large hide and a elephant tooth of a good bigness as a gratuity for the present I have bring he wherein may be judge what loss I receive when the valuation the valuation of the present give he which be so high esteem of what I deliver and by he so much esteem do not cost here at home according to our merchant account above the great sum of 18 d after I have eat my desire be to go see the town and view their dwell he send certain people with i who bring i through their street or house into the plain field where I the description of the town call Setico may thorough discern the whole situation I do heedful regard it for it do appear the great town or place that I have see and the manner thereof in my opinion be worthy the observation the town be build round after the manner of a circle whereof the front of the house do not contain any great thickness but as we may say the breadth of a reasonable fair street join their house or wall of their yard and barn close together the diameter whereof that be from the north to the south or likewise from any one point to his opposite we do conceive to be near a english mile within which Circute be much cartle especial store of ass whereby it may be conjecture that they contrive their town in that sort to keep out the raven beast and secure those cattle they have about they whereof at this place they have the great use I mean of their ass as I will relate unto you but first I must take leave of the high priest after I have satisfy myself in look abroad I return unto he into his house where I find he lay along in extremity of pain he seem to labour much in his desire to have have conference with i say he have earnest wish to see i that we may have speak together concern our law and something he speak but what come from he be very unperfect which I impute to the pain he endure only I note when he will have speak of Adam and Eve and Moses and so I take notice of the name in that manner he may well perceive we have knowledge of they he seem to take pleasure therein but the conclusion the chief mary-buck wonderful desuous to confer with i about our religion with he be to no purpose nor worth rehearsal so that after he have make i to eat by he a dish of excellent cream dress with corn after their best fashion and a solemn farewell pass betwixt we I leave he not withstand before I proceed fur there I will relate what I have gather of their profession and what they conceit of we they do worship the same as we do the true and only God to who they pray and on his name they call in their they worship the true God above who they call alle. language express by the word insomuch as if he see any thing which beget in he admiration cast his eye to the heaven he cry awl awl neither have they among they any manner of image or picture or resemblance of any divine thing they have no manner of image but as far as we can perceive such thing be distasteful unto they they do acknowledge Mahomet and be all circumcise the manner of their circumcision I refer to speak of in another place their sabbath or the seven day be upon the Friday and have distinction and proper name for seven day in their week they reckon their age or time by the reins in say he have live so many reins as we say so many year howbeit we do never hear they call upon the name of Mahomet neither have they among they any church nor place they dedicate to holy use so far as we can they have no chuche perceive neither do we find that they celebrate or solemnize they sabbath day for even on that day will they follow any trade they will have with we and their own occasion without any intermission they observe not their sabbath they have certain round house build open and be spacious according to their fashion wherein they teach their youth the manner whereof be this all the male child that proceed the manner of teach their male child to write and read from these marybucke be teach to write and read and in regard they have no paper among they but what we or other bring they in the way of trade and therefore be of esteem they have for their book a small smooth board fit to hold in their hand on with the child lesson be write with a kind of black ink they make and the pen be in a manner of a pencil the the manner of their character character they use be much like the Hebrew which in regard I understand not I cause my mary-buck to write in paper some part of their law which I bring home with i that some of our learned scholar may peruse if we may by that mean come to any better knowledge than the small practice we have hitherto have and by their law be not write in the public man of our capacity can so easy be attain only this much we discern that the religion and law they teach be not write in the same tongue they public speak and moreover that none of the temporal people of what dignity soever be trade up to write or read or have any use of book or letter among they and whether these open house they teach their child in be place for their religious ceremony and for their public meeting in their holy exercise because they be ever place near the principal man dwelling and as it be join unto he we can well resolve but rather conceit the contrary in regard they lie open and be not sweep and keep with any manner of decency and therefore do rather think they make use of the open field where under some spacious we suppose they perform their religion ceremony under the shady tree shady tree they observe their meeting some part of the manner whereof as a eye witness I will ready recite the place where we have house build and wall with straw for our own use be seat by the river side upon the top of the bank and by the people of the country call Condo the whiteman town some hundred pace within we from the river be a small town of these religious people they call our dwelling the white man town wherein live a ancient mary-buck call Mahome who can not be less in appearance then a hundred year of age from who we receive much relation concern the country above and of the abundance of gold there which himself have travel and see as it be their profession to do and I shall have occasion forthwith to show you this ancient mahome be ever a faithful and love neighbour unto we howbeit in regard of his in any oecasion of fall out between the people and we this old man will come with his assegy present to aid we age he do not teach the child nor be not the eminent man of the town but one hammet who be not so trusty a neighbour the old mahome do diverse time lodge and entertain stranger that come especial of his own profession amongst which there have lie one night at his house a mary-buck who in the morning come down to the river side close without our wall have his slave to follow he who bring in his hand a great gourd in the river he fill it full of water and bring unto he whereinto present pull forth all his privy member he put they without any niceness of be see what he do and after he have well wash they he make he to throw away the water which do and the gourd well wash orrince he bring he another fill also with water wherein he wash and rub his hand and in the like manner it be throw away and a three bring wherewith he wash and cleanse his face all which perform he make a kind of low reverence with his body and lay his hand on his breast his face direct towards the east kneel down and there mumble or utter forth after a decent manner it shall seem certain prayer wherein after he have continue for a space kiss the ground he their manner of devotion rise up and turn himself about with his face direct to the west he perform the like ceremony which end after he have stay and look a while upon we he return to his place of lodging one ceremony more of their religion I will relate if you please to remember where and how I leave the chief mary-buck sick and full of danger it do manifest no less for in the evening the day after I come from he he die the report whereof be immediate spread over the whole country the death of the chief mary-buck who from all part come in after that abundant manner to solemnize his funeral so many thousand of man and woman gather together as in such a desert and scatter country may breed admiration which I think be rather increase in regard at that time he die the moon be high and give her light and they in whole troop travel either the whole night or most part of the the great resort to his burial same together the place or port whereat my boat do ride be a passage or ferry to the town from the whole country on the further side whereunto belong a great Canoe which I have hire have likewise another of my own both which never stand still but be use night and day in pass the people none of they come empty some bring beef other goat and cock and henue with rice and all sort of grain the country yield so as there come in a wonderful deal of provision my mary-buck entreat i to send they do bury the body withal sweet savour and perfume they can get something of sweet savour to be cast upon his body which the people much esteem of I send some and some Orras which by his son be thankful receive the manner of his burial be after this sort he be lay in a house where a grave be dig and a great pot of water the manner of burial set in the room and just after the same manner as the irish do use with a wonderful noise of cry and lamentation he be lay into the ground the people especial the woman run about the house and from place to place with their arm spread after a lunatic fashion seem with great sorrow to bewail his departure they also assemble themselves in the most convenient place to receive the multitude and near unto the grave and sit down in a round ring in the middle come forth a mary-buck who betwixt say and sing do rehearse as it be certain verse in the praise and remembrance of he depart which it shall seem be do extempore verse and oration in commendation of the decease or provide for that assembly because upon diverse word or sentence he speak the people will make such sudden exultation by clap of their hand and every one run in to give and present unto he some one or other manner of thing may be think acceptable that one aster another every several mary-buck will have his speech wherein they only go away with the gratification who have the please stile or as we term it the most eloquent phrase in set forth the praise of he depart in which the people be so much delight another ceremony be that every principal mary-buck and man of note among they will take of the earth which come forth of the place his grave be dig and with the same water which be in the pot stand in the same room will moisten the say earth and so form thereof a round ball which they will a relic of great esteem carry away with they and esteem of as a great relic whereof my Alchade or mary-buck because of those perfume I send be admit to have one which he so high esteem I can not at any rate purchase it from he although I make he offer of more than I mean to give this assembly hold for the space of ten day with a continual recourse of come and go but not altogether for the burial of the dead for after certain day be spend in the celebrate of his obsequy than begin a great solemnity for the establish and invest of his elder son in his place and dignity whereunto come again the invest of the elder son in the father place many gift and present among those that pass by i I take notice of a great ram which be carry between two bind fast and lay upon a hurdle in the whole time I be in the country I never see any ram or sheep but that which a ram for sacrifice be bring very far his wool may more proper be call hair it be of that hardness I do understand by my mary-buck he be to be use after some manner of sacrifice and I understand likewise that in their high priesthood the son succeed the father and this course be hold among their religious order wherein they differ from the temporal government it follow I shall now deliver their poor opinion they shall concern we and our profession wherein with humble reverence I crave pardon that my hand hold in the least sort be make a instrument to show or set down any thing opposite unto my lord and saviour but by show the weakness of natural man and the wisdom that remain in rot flesh the glory of God more perfect appear to the confirm and comfort of every true and perfect establish Christian when we show unto they we honour and serve God above and likewise his son who be send upon the earth and suffer death for we who be call jesus by that name they do not know he but by the name of nale they speak they call Christ by the name of nale of a great prophet who do many and great miracle whereof they have among they diverse repetition and that his mother name be Maria and he they do acknowledge to be a wondrous good man but to be God son they say it be impossible for say they God be never see and who can see God and live much more for God to have the knowledge of woman in that kind that we shall believe it they do wonder at we the rather they say because they see God love we better than they in give we such good thing they see we have and be able to bring unto they and likewise the opinion they hold concern he they do admire our knowledge be able to make such vessel as can carry we through such great water and how we shall find our way more especial high up in the river when we talk of the sea whereof they be altogether ignorant only by the name or word Fancassa which signify great water thus like human creature in darkness they argue be bar from that glorious light which shine in the east whereof though they have hear they have not yet make use but no doubt when the fullness of time be come they shall for among themselves a prophecy remain that they shall be subdue and remain subject to a white people and what know we but that determinate time of God be at hand and that it shall be his almighty pleasure to make our nation his instrument whereof in my part I be strong comfort in regard of the familiar conversation we find among they and the fair acceptance I receive in the upper part I attain where I have a people come down unto i who have never see white man before with who we trade with a fair commerce and some savour of a golden sequel the relation whereof will follow very speedy only it be necessary I part not obrupt from my religious company and to acquaint you that they have great book all manuscript of their religion and that we have see when company of marybucke have travel by we some of their people lade therewith many of they they have book of great volume all manuscript be very great and of a large volume which travel of they it be most necessary I acquaint you withal in regard from thence proceed a great deal of intelligence we have and I may not let pass one virtue of they the narration whereof may make their intelligence somewhat more respect and in my poor opinion carry alongst a better esteem it may please you to call to mind when I leave the king in the midst of their cup I promise to show you a sober people which be these marybuck betwixt who and the temporal people be a wonderful difference the rather in regard they live upon one and the same ground the temperature of the day be the same wherein the desire of those common people be for aquavitae and hot drink that they will many time pawn their arm both their bow and arrow and sword from their neck for that hot liquor yea many time their clothes from their back to and glut their earnest desire which seem to we never to be satisfy now to the contrary the mary-buck will by no mean take or touch on drop thereof of what kind somever it be tie himself the wonderful soberness of these marybucke strict to no manner of drink but water and not only himself that be the man or malekind but likewise their wife and woman neither will or can at any time be draw to taste or receive any jot of this our comfortable liquor nay more they will not suffer none of their child not so much as the little infant who in the place we live at through daily recourse one with another be grow to such familiarity with we that they will many time steal from their home and come and hang about we these small one we may not give any wine no nor any manner of fruit as reason or sugar or any sweet thing without great offence unto the parent and if he happen they find it with they they will take it away with they abstain from all sweet thing great displeasure and although themselves be never so sick and in those time we will persuade they how comfortable it will be unto they we can by no mean prevail to gain any manner of inclination towards it for example as I be travel up the river in my boat upon some occasion our people be in the water and in the shallow lead up our boat a sudden deepness occasion by a steep bank bring they beyond their reach and enforce they to shift for themselves by swim my Alchade or mary-buck be one of they who can reasonable use his arm be notwithstanding take in a whirlpool and in great danger of drown have be twice at the bottom a strange ample of abstinence but at the second rise one of our man take hold upon he and with help we present get he aboard be almost spend and his sense go we earnest to recover he fear the agony we see he in get rosa-solis to put in his mouth the send whereof as it appear make he hold close his lip that we give he none but within a while he come perfect to himself and as it seem retain the savour so as he ask whether he have take any or no he be answer no I have rather say he have die than any shall have come within i although I be very persuade the very favour refresh and do he good wherein they have a great resemblance to the rechabite speak of in the thirty five chapter of the prophet jeremy who keep zealous the command of jonadab their father from whence these may be lineal descend in regard it be say they proceed from Hobab the father in law of Moses and Moses wife be note to be a ethiopian and this be the principal mark we know these marybucke by that howsomever they can by their habit be discern from the common people yet in offer they to taste or drink the true way to know a mary-buck^ our foresay liquor they be present to be distinguish which soberness of their be a evident sign that they be always themselves to which I add that as they do not love we shall promise they any thing but be sure of performance so in any thing we can discern we receive no false report or untruth from they they will tell no lie with which confidence I go forward with the relation of their trade and travail these marybucke be a people who dispose themselves in general when they be in their able age to travail go in whole family together and carry along their book and manuscript and their boy or young race with they who the marybuck manner of travail they teach and instruct in any place they rest or repose themselves for which the whole country be open before they to harbour and sit down as night or necessity overtake they always dispose themselves to some town whereunto they be not overchargeable but only to rest their body in regard we see they always carry provision for the belly with they which we conceit be renew as they meet with some principal person or make their rendevow in some eminent place this we be sure that there be not any of they pass we but they will use the custom of the whole country which be to beg without they will beg of we without denial any denial and although to we it be but a poor matter in respect of the trade we have much more what we hope and look for to give unto they or among a whole company a quire of paper which cost three penny yet to they it be a rich reward out of which they questionless do raise the great part of sustenance to travel withal and what else may be available unto they make thereof by write in the paper their bless Gregory which they give and bestow as they find occasion and to confirm we herein this we note that if we have occasion to send any of the country people of any message or employment for we after he have agree for his reward he will oak to have a sheet or two of paper give he which be to buy he sustenance as he pass from town to town so as you shall never meet with any of this profession but in discourse they can speak of more country than their own native place one chief reason to encourage their travel we have learn which be that they have the mary-buck free to travail in all place free recourse through all place so that howsoever the king and country be at war and up in arm the one against the other yet still the mary-buck be a privilege person and many follow his trade or course of travel without any let or interruption of either side notwithstanding there be none of these marybucke but go arm and be as complete furnish as any of the other people and have the manner of use and exercise of their weapon in as ample manner as they have where unto I think they be rather invite in regard of those wild and raven beast the country be store withal that upon any occasion they may be able to defend themselves and offend their offensive enemy to particularize herein I may tell you of those two ancient marybucke who be our neighbour in the town where our house their report of gold stand who both of they will relate unto we of infinite store of gold which they have see the country above to abound withal wherein the more ancient man who we find so love a friend will speak marvelous confident howbeit he will tell we there be a dangerous people to pass before we come unto they and that the river be so full of tree we shall not be able to get our boat along and in token of fear when I be to begin my journey upward and come in the evening to take my leave of he take my right hand betwixt both his he utter over it diverse unknown word and ever and anon will spare spatter with his spittle upon it after which lay his mouth close to my old mahome he ceremony at my go up neck over my right shoulder he will after the like manner perform there which his superstitious zeal be assure do in love I do not contemptuous refuse because I be ignorant of any offence therein but with a friendly courtesy part with he and my return back be to he as joyful the other who be a more or as I may say most subtle fellow promise to be my guide along and to pass in the boat with i and thereby wrought upon my willingness to embrace his company to the serve his own turn and get from i many such gift and courtesy as otherwise the subtlety of his neighbour hammet he can never have attain hold i in hand he will meet i at a port above but there deceive i to my further trouble and at our return prevent his cause be fear of the people above which God be praise fall out to the contrary whereof forthwith it will fall right to tell you only I must first say something concern the great town of Setico and of the trade they follow with those same number of ass whereof before I tell you the inhabitant here who be all marybucke be the only people who follow a continual trade from their own house down to the king of bursall who dwell as you may remember the trade and travail of the marybuck of Setico be say to be by the sea side at which place the sea shore do natural yield great store of salt but it be a course and dirty kind insomuch as the great part which we have see and take notice of do rather look like dirt or sea-coal ash then resemble the salt we have in use or make our trade withal to buy which they carry down as their chief commodity the slave or people of the country whereof the king of Bursall do wherewith he maintain his greatness make such profit as it be suppose to be a principal of the revenue wherewith he maintain his greatness this commodity the people do carry likewise far up into the country for among themselves we can perceive they make little use thereof so as their travel be long and tedious the return they make be not discern to be any thing but gold and a kind of nut they call Cola which be in great esteem among they thevertue whereof I shall hereafter tell you and for that it may be here demand what become of the gold by they bring down I will show you what by report be tell we these marybucke do hold a opinion that after their death they shall appear in another world wherein this gold will be of great esteem and therefore strive to furnish themselves all they can therewith a ill opinion of the marybucke to bury their gold which either in their life time they secret in the ground do hide or by their dear friend cause to be bury with they esteem themselves happy that can with great quantity be furnish another use they make be to buy from the portugese a sort of fair long and square blue stone which stone their woman wear about their middle to keep they from bloody issue unto which they be general subject the occasion rise from the man as may be well suppose if you but remember or call to your mind after what sort they be describe and this be see by that esteem a good commodity the Portingalls make of that commodity which bring as I observe so great a store and quantity of gold among they other use within themselves they have none but that the woman wear it hang in their ear in ring and pendant make up with little art and as unhandsome workmanship these people of Setico be the most unwilling we shall proceed in the search of the river of any other not only tell we themseluesof many danger but at all town where we come and among our familiar have leave their persuasion if it can have prevail to discourage we or whether they do very think our boat can never have find passage in regard it be never the reason of look after Buckor Sano attempt by any such vessel before or as I incline unto fear we may be hinderer to the trade they have so long follow and whereunto they be settle be well provide with such number of ass as beast of burden to proceed and follow the same so as from they we can get no comfortable intelligence wherein reason lead the way that every man profit be near to himself but as it shall please God to encourage you the noble governor and company to prepare and settle yourselves with a serious resolution to note follow the far search of this rich expectation these people of Setico of all other be the likely and dwell the most convenient to be bring to a more settle and commodious trade which will fall upon they with a great deal less trouble and infinite less travel and withal be make especial instrument of our good whereunto as yet their gross understand can ascend and ancient custom be harsh to be alter how beit these be the consideration that make i endeavour to settle a league with the high priest and establish a perfect course of amity betwixt we which course of i I shall more bold commend to your fair acceptance when you shall see it ground upon the experience of my whole travail and trade in the river and after my discourse and conference with that great black merchant bucker Sano concern who and all my proceed above I now be come to make a full relation our travel up the river when I be come to Baraconda which be the high town the river flow unto and notwithstanding all the discouragement I receive be absolute bend to proceed up the river by mean of bacay Tombo a principal man of that country who bring i two beef I be furnish with two blacke-man more to go up with i the one a mary-buck the other bacan the marybucke name be Selyman the other tombo Tombo his kinsman who he say have live at Tinda which be the place we aim at not to the town itself but to the mouth of a little river which be say to run near unto the place and from thence fell into the main river where we be two blacke-man I have before that be my Alchade of who I talk and a pretty youth call Samgulley who from the first come of George Samgulley a black boy tompson into the river have always live with the english and follow their affair so as he be come to speak our tongue very handsome and he I use many time as a interpreter so as in all we have four blacke-man who help we can not miss in regard we carry with we a small canon that be ready at all time to put a shore and when we come to a anchor to fetch wood or any other provision as likewise to carry we ashore and bring other to we reserve our boat in the midst of the river as a castle and refuge for we thus we be ten englishman and these four black go the fifteen of january in the evening from Baraconda and be go against the stream until Friday the twenty six in the morning which be eleven day travail wherein I desire to be right understand that our labour be eleven day travel against the stream wherein we wrought eighty eight hour about four hour in the morning and four in the evening so as our whole time spend therein amount but to four score and eight hour in which time our sabbath day be observe only two hour in the evening whenas my man earnest entreat to be go in which time we recover within half a league of the place or river mouth we intend to go unto and further we will not have pass nor endanger ourselves and what we carry into the little river until we have make trial of the people disposition and how they shall stand affect to we we meet here with a shoal as I have say in the description of the river which stay we we can pass no high we conclude therefore in the afternoon to send away three of our blacke-man who be willing to go direct they to Buckor Sano of Tinda to who we send a present and likewise I send to the king of the place as the manner be and give our blacke-man wherewithal to buy they victual demand of they when they think we shall expect their return they say Sunday night wherein I speak after our own phrase and while they be travel it will be necessary I acquaint you what be the ground or reason we seek after this Buckor Sano and labour to get near to this Tinda make more especial choice of he then of any other man George tompson in his diligence while he live hear of diverse caravan that past in the country and go down to the king of bursal dominion for salt have learned that the only and princpal man that maintain the great trade be that Buckor Sano who dwelling be at Tinda who maintain and keep too ass follow that tedious travel tompsons desire lead he forthwith to go find this merchant and in a pair of oar as I speak in the beginning go up the river and travel some way by land recover Tinda but find not his black merchant in regard he be travel high into the country in the sale and utter of his salt commodity Thompson return but find his expectation so satisfy in that he have hard of the moor of Barbary and be come so near where they frequent that he talk of nothing but how to settle habitation and fortify the river to defend themselves and keep out other nation but these his desire die in his unhappy end and this be all our acquaintance which now I come to second by send unto this Buckor Sano to come down unto the river to we as the only man we be willing to sell and commend our commodity unto and by this time Sunday night be come and none of my blackman return Monday likewise all spend in expectation on twesday our man begin to grumble and my especial consort to speak out there be no reason we shall hazard our some of our man grow fearful self by stay any long in regard it be fall out as we be tell below that they be a bloody and dangerous people and therefore those people we send up be murder and if we stay our turn will be next and likewise that we have no flesh leave and our other provision be very scanty I give they content with fair word that the place may be far of than they conceit in regard we have be on the top of the mountain and can discern no likelihood of town or habitation of which we have have no acquaintance since we come from baraconde and in regard the country about we be abundant replenish with all manner of wild beast we will try our endeavour and on the wednesday morning I as big in body as a great stag and have wreathe bornes go out with two more and kill a great and goodly beast which be no soon bring down and cut out and hang to cool under the shady tree on shore but there appear in sight three blackman the one be one of those we send who have bring with he Buckor brother and the king of tindas servant and they come before to the return of one of our messenger see we and what commodity we have bring word that the next day Buckor Sano will be there himself I have they aboard my boat and make they courteous entertainment give they some small commodity and when the evening come we feast with our venison the next day about noon come Buckor Sano with his music play before he with the come of Buckor Sano great solemnity and his best clothes on and about some 40. more arm with their bow and arrow with he he show no more at first within two hour after there be two hundred man and woman come thither he sit down upon the bank under a shady tree after a little stay I go a shore to he and our salutation be past I desire he to go aboard whereof he kind accept and withal show i a beef he have bring to give i for the present I have send he diverse goat the people have provision the people bring likewise bring and corn and cock and hen so as there be no need to doubt any more want of victual he carry no more aboard with he but two after he be in the boat I shoot off three such gun as I have to welcome he at the noise whereof he seem much to rejoice call the report of the powder by the name of the white man thunder and take notice of the head and the hide of the dear which we have kill which we show he be slay by one of our gun they his go aboard the boat and report of our powder send with admiration from one place to another and certify that there be a people come who with thunder kill the wild beast in the wood and the fowl in the air which for it be our daily use to kill one sort of foul call a stalker which be as high as a man and have as much meat a stalker of his body as be in a lamb which diverse time we use to kill and eat more especial we desire to have his feather which grow on his tail which be of use and such as be wear and esteem of here at home among we I have of my own provision good rosa-solis take forth a glass I drink unto he after he have drink he take off the say of Buckor Sano aboard the boat his sword and give it i to lay up say defend i here in your boat and I will secure you on shore he like our drink so well he suck it in and as it seem not know the strength of it take more than he will have do insomuch as he fall asleep the people that come with he in the mean time cut of reed make they house other fetch in wood make fire every where about they so as it seem a little town Buckor Sano sleep fond upon my bed by i in the boat and in the morning complain of his head and this much I must justify in his behalf that during he be but once overtake with our strong drink the time we be together he be never overtake by drink after but observe the course he see we use to take a small cup before meat and another after and this ever give he satisfaction he desire to see all the commodity we have which he like very well of and whereas we think our iron will have be greedy desire we find it not so for they tell we there be a people neighbour unto they who have knowledge to make it howbeit they be diverse time in war together but some of our iron we put away at better rate than below by one three and may have do away all we have if we will have accept of hide which for the reason I shall present show be refuse howsomever this be the main business that after they see our salt no other thing be esteem among they which at first seem strange unto they forasmuch as they have never see any of that fashion before the salt we have be only bay salt which after they put in their mouth and taste they will look up and cry awl in token of the good esteem they have of it after two hour of the morning spend my merchant the great esteem of salt go on shore keep my gown about he which when the evening shut in the night before I have put upon he and in a manner of state he go one shore withal wear of it in that manner it may well appear they be not use to such kind of ornament the first thing he do after he come on shore he cause on to make a low outcry in manner of a proclamation prohibe any of the people he make a proclamation to buy or barter with we but as he bargain all that day he find himself so sick after his drink that he tell i he can tend no business only he show unto i certain young black woman who be stand by themselves and have white string across their body which he he offer woman to sell unto we tell i be slave bring for i to buy I make answer we be a people who do not deal in any such commodity neither do we buy or sell one another or any that have our own shape he seem to marvel much at it and tell we it be the only merchandise they carry down into the country where they fetch all their salt and that they be sell there to white man who earnest desire they especial such young woman as he have bring for we we answer they be another kind of people different from we but for our part if they have no other commodity we will return again he make reply that they have hide and elephant tooth cotton yarn and the clothes of the country which in our trade we call negro their commodity clothes he be answer for their hide we will not buy in regard our boat be little and we can not convenient carry they but if they will bring they low down the river where our big vessel can come we will buy they all but for their tooth cotton and clothes we will deal for they so against the next morning be Saturday we have a house build by the water side open round about and cover with reed on the top to shadow we from the sun and a markethouse make a shorc this be our market house when we come to trade we ask which shall be the staple commodity to pitch the price upon to value other thing by they show we one of their clothes and for that they only desire our salt we fall to love and bid upon the proportion wherein we have such difference and hold so long that many of they seem to dislike and make show that they will go away but after we conclude there be no more difference every man bring his commodity our salt go away and as they dispatch they likewise return in company together and still other come that we have the place continual furnish we never talk unto they of gold the warn not to take notice of their gold principal we come for but wait opportunity and notwithstanding we see it wear in their woman ear warning be give none of our people shall take any great notice of it as a thing we shall great desire until occasion be give by Buckor Sano himself who take note of our guilt sword and some other thing we have although but poor set out with some show of gold trim do ask if that be gold he be answer yes it shall seem say he you have much of this in your country we affirm the same and that it be a thing our man do all use to wear and therefore if they have any we will buy it of they because we have more use than they for it you shall have say he what be among our woman here but if I do know you will esteem of that I will be provide to bring you such quantity as shall buy all thing you bring and if you will be sure to come still unto we I will not fail to meet you and proceed further he say this country above do abound therewith insomuch as these eye of i point two of his finger to his eye as the country manner in speak be have be four several time at a great town above the house whereof be cover only with gold we demand of he how long he be go and come thither he answer four moon we ask he if he will carry some of we thither he answer yes but they have enemy by the Buckor Sanos report of gold and of the house above cover therewith way sometime to fight with they we show he present our gun and tell he we will carry they with we and kill they all at which he seem to take a great deal of content before I go further I will take occasion here to set down their manner of travel they go in company together and drive before they their he seem wondrous will of our company ass who ordinary pace they follow begin their day journey when the day appear which be even at the sun rise for so near the equinoctial there be a short dawn either before the sun rise or after she set and continue travel some three hour then be they enforce to rest all the heat of the day some two hour before he sun set go forward again and so continue until night come whenas they be sure to harbour themselves for fear of wild beast except in some moon light night and then they will travel the better likewise when they come to some special town they will rest themselves and their ass 2. or 3. day together lay all their burden under some shady tree close to the town set forth such thing as they have to sale maintain in the time they be there a kind of market and their ass be spanseld which be their 2. foreleg tie together feed by they the people themselves lodging among their burden upon such mat as they ever carry with they of which kind of inn or lodging place they can seldom miss the country be well replenish so as if you please to observe although the time seem much which be spend in this iourn yet the way can be much if you consider the manner of iourn wherein leave to speak far until I come to a more ample application I return again to Buckor Sano my black merchant in our time of trade together if it be his own good he barter for he will tell we this be for myself and you must deal better with i then either with the king of the country or any other because I be as you be a julietto which signify a merchant that go from place to place neither do I as the king of our country do which be to eat and drink and lie still at home among their woman but I seek abroad as you do and therefore be near unto you neither be I unwilling Buckor Sano his subtle speech to answer someways his expectation in hope I shall better forward our own end in our course of familiarity after time I take some special note of the blade of his sword and a pair of brass bracelt one of his wife have upon her arm both which thing do appear to i to be such as may very well be bring in their beginning either from London or some other part of this our native country I demand of he where he have they he make answer there be a people use to come among they who they his declaration of the moor of Barbary call arabeck who bring they these and diverse other commodity we ask what manner of people he describe the tawny Moor unto we and say they come in great company together and with many camel how acceptable this report be unto i may be conjecture by any such who be serious incline to give a fair and just account of any such employment they be interest in please intelligence be the main business we aim at and who desire with affection labour the full satisfaction of the trust impose upon they this his relation make it certain that these be the moor of Barbary the discovery of who trade and traffic be the ground of this our be so high in the river we grow to question he how near those people come to the place we be now at he answer within 6 day journey there be a town call Mumbarre unto which town the next moon these arabecke will come we ask again what commodity they bring with they he answer much salt and diverse other thing we desire then to know what they exchange for and carry back he answer nothing but gold and that they only desire to have and return nothing else we question he far whether he will undertake to carry any of their course of trade we safe to see those arabecke and that we may return without danger he stop his nose between his finger and his thumb and cry hore hore which be the great oath they use among they that he will a oath they observe careful perform it some other conference pass betwixt we at this time howbeit by reason of a disaster that fall in the way betwixt i and my chief interpreter I be hinder from understand diverse particular wherein Buckor Sano seem very desirous to give i full satisfaction so as from he these be the principal I gather howbeit another occasion fall whereby I have some far relation as in his due place shall a unhappy accident follow for the conveniency whereof I must once again with your favour return to a great company on shore who expect their trade for this our conference with Buckor Sano be aboard our boat at dinner the people who come unto we for the first four day be stay here come only upon that side our merchant come but one of our hire black man speak unto i to give he some paper and bead to buy he and two other provision as they go and they will go seek other inhabitant likewise who dwell a people that neversaw white man before on the other part of the river wherewith furnish they go away and two day after return and bring with they diverse people who in the like manner make they house of reed to harbour themselves under these people have never see white man before and the woman that come with they be very shy and fearful of we insomuch as they will run behind the man and into the house to hide from we when we offer to come near they I send therefore into the boat for some bead and such thing and go unto some of the bold give they thereof into their hand which they be willing to receive and with these courtesy imboldue they that they soon become familiar and in requital give i again tobacco and fine neat cane they have to take tobacco with these woman be the deep and large print upon the back that ever we see the man likewise show a more savage kind of people strange breech the common people do wear than we have see many have breech make of raw hide either of dear or other cattle the grace whereof be the tail of the beast which remain on the skin do stick right forth upon the hinder part of the man buttock resemble the manner as the beast wear it whereat those black man who be our hireling will in scorn jest and deride the principal man of these part call baiage Dinggo I have into my boat and curtcous use demand if he do not know of our be there in regard we think he may hear our gun he answer they have hard the noise and be much amaze suppose it to be thunder be the more fearful unto they because the sound come that way it be not accustom to do they be very desirous also to buy of our salt and some of that little store we bring they have which the people on the other side do unwilling spare we buy of they such commodity as the rest have and wonderful desirous they be we shall come again unto they the best of these woman likewise do wear in their ear gold and many commodity the woman ask for which we have not but the man especial for salt there be a encouragement to search further up the river not so little as 500 man and woman who come down on this side the river and it do plain appear both the one and the other side be of familiar acquaintance in regard they do pass in our Canoe the one to the other and have neighbourly salutation together and further we note that the natural tongue there speak be another different language yet all the better sort do talk together in the same speech we bring with we and be from the mouth of the river their familiarity do assure we that they have commerce together which be a encourager to the confidence I have of the river continuance and that they have the use of canoe above to ferry over in regard in these people have another language this place where we be although it be so shallow they may wade over they be afeard to attempt it dread their neighbout bombo will be in the way and hinder their passage leave they therefore safe on their one side with a faithful expectation of our these people expect our return second return which we promise and they earnest desire I cross the river to our first acquaintance to who be come down the king of the country call by the name of the king of jelicot who be the immediate king of that land whereon we keep our trade I go on shore entreat he to come into our boat and there we drink I give he a present which he accept and bring he likewise a shore the king come unto we where he have house build for himself and his wife on who also some thing must be bestow they bring with they commodity to barter in do of which and look upon we they continue four day each night after we have sup aboard our boat where Buckor Sano do ever eat with i nor during Buckor Sano do always eat with we in the boat the will time of my stay there do he fail i one meal notwithstanding I do diverse time send both fish and foul unto his wife so do I likewise unto the king while he remain by we which we take with our hook and kill with our gun our manner be to go on shore and either at the king house or Buckor Sanos before the door fire be make and mat spread to sit down upon the fiddler play on their music and in dawnce and sing and sometime the man march with their bow and arrow to show their warlike exercise we spend great these exercise do common hold three hour in the night part of the evening wherein with the small show we can make we be not behind hand to let they hear our powder and see our manner of march wherein they take much pleasure and common these evening sport cost we a quart bottle of aquavita which make their tongue free and their body full of agility wherein always they do strive to show a desire they have to give content unto

character they use so much as the circle will contain this perform Buckor Sano come upon his knee and hand to the heap and stoop with his mouth take a full mouthful which present he spit and spatter forth again the possession give unto i then take both his hand full of the loose earth he come forward on his knee and both our marybucke with their handsfull in the like manner and throw the earth into my lap which do they present rise and two woman come with loose clothes therewith fan cool and wipe the body of Buckor Sano who retire himself into his house put on his best clothes arm himself with his bow and arrow and more in the same manner follow he come again before we every man a arrow or two ready in his bow march round about we twice or thrice which do bukor Sano come to i and turn his face from i kneel down upon his right knee put his a great protestation of defence leg between i as I sit which his body seem to shadow i present his bow and draw his arroweup signify that so he will fight and oppose his body in defence of i then rise up he give away his bow and arrow to another and sit down by i so all the rest as their turn come kneel either before i or he perform the like action and this be the manner of give we the country and deliver a full possession which bounteous gift and great solemnity can not require less than two or three bottle of our best liquor which be according perform and set they into their ceremonious discourse wherein because the night be far spend we be willing to leave they and betake ourselves to our own castle be little the rich for all that great gift and spacious scope of land we be in that ample manner endow withal the next day among many that come unto the place we do observe some who be mark under both their eye with three blue stroke resemble a people mark in the face stripe all after one manner demand therefore what they be it be answer a people who belong to a king further up in the country and by those mark they be distinguish and know observe this marybucke from other people this day likewise come unto we a ancient Marybucke take acquaintance of our people to who he be very well know I inquire what he be and they tell i it be a mary-buck who do use to Ferambra and be acquaint Ferambra be lord of his country and when the p ortingal have get the king of Nany to send horseman to kill Thompson and his small company he do preserve they and put himself and country in arm for their defence with George Thompson and that he have a wife in town which be within three mile of Conda the place where our habitation upon the land be and George Thompson do use to lie at this house who have show himself a faithful friend in time of need unto he and his company and likewise confirm the same unto i by diverse courtesy which pass betwixt we during my time of trade in the river I ask the mary-buck from whence he come and he answer from jay a town nine day travel high in the country whether he be send by George Thompson and seem to lament much for his death he tell we there be great store of gold at that place and that the marybucke first tale the arabeck which be the moor of Barbary come thither we ask he if he will undertake to carry foam of we thither he answer yes if we be but past these bad people point to our consort ashore we tell he they be a good people and very love to we shake his head he say immane which signify naught or the thing they like not he have two or three other consort with he and make haste to be go keep themselves sever from the other people during their time of stay he tell we he be go down to and by he I send letter to our merchant below which be very orderly deliver by reason he be in some fear and come in the night aboard of we make such haste away we have little conference but meet of he afterward in my trade at Setico I have a full and large discourse and receive the intelligence which I will now recite he tell i that not far from jay there be a people who will his second discourse not be see and that the salt be carry unto they and how the arabeck have all their gold from they although they do never see they demand the cause he make a sign unto his lip and can receive no far answer he say likewise if we can have go further up the river with our boar many people will have come unto we and bring great store of gold and to the place where we do stay he say many people be come down both from jay and many other town but that they be send back again by such as have go from we and tell our salt be endded we ask he as we have do Buckor Sano and other if they have a town call Tombutto that our opinion cercern Trombutto and Gago name thcy know not but a town call Tomboconda they say be near where we be then fay the pronunciation of which two place as Tomboconda for Tombutto and fay for Gago may if therebe such two place carry some resemblance wherein I stand to put forth this question who shall he be that direct these name be it be apparent never white man either by land or water be up this more encouragement to go further up the river country so far but we this man likewise tell we of the house cover with gold and many strong encouragement to invite we on especial to go further up the river to this let i now set down although not able to name particular author what be the general report for the Moor of Barbary his trade that it be certain when they come up into the country where the manner of merchandize without speech or sight one of the other they have their chief trade they do observe one set time and day to be at a certain place whereas house be appoint for they wherein they find no body nor have sight of any person at this place they do unlade their commodity and lay their salt in several heap and likewise set their bead bracelet and any other commodity in parcel together they depart and remain away a whole day in which day come the people they trade withal and to each several lay down a proportion of gold as he value it and leave both the commodity and the gold go his way the merchant return again as he accept of the bargain take away the gold and let the commodity remain or if he find there be to little leave divide his commodity into another part for which he will have more at the unknown people return they take to themselves where they see the gold be go and either lay more gold or take away what be lay before and remain in suspense so that at the merchant three time his bargain be finish for either he find more gold or the first take away and his commodity lest and this it be say they have a just manner of trade and never see one another the report of the people with the great lip to which be add that the reason why these people will not be see be for that they be natural bear with their low lip of that greatness it turn again and cover the great part of their bosom and remain with that rawness on the side that hang down that through occasion of the sun extreme heat it be still subject to putrefaction so as they have no mean to preserve themselves but by continual cast salt upon it and this be the reason salt be so precious among they their country be so far up in the land natural yield none and this carry some appearance by what we be able to say for first out of our own experience we the people who buy our salt have no use of it but for sale find that these people who trade with we for our salt have for their own occasion little or no use thereof and be demand what they do with it they do not deny to tell we they carry it up further into the country unto another people to who they do sell and vent the same which still be good inducement to follow a further search and therein to neglect no time but diligent to follow the occasion already obtain which be the love of these people who be hold so dangerous who be so earnest for our come again and to hold a certain course of trade with they which by we be faithful promise wherein the adventurer have this strong encouragement that if we shall attain no further then among these people the gain be know to be great upon our exchange and fit according to carry a good proportion will yield a valuable return to the full satisfaction a reasonable desire this ought speedy to be consider of may aim at but if it please God to prosper the discovery and that we meet with any place of habitation again by the river side which may be a convenient seat of residence to maintain a settle trade in there can be no opposition to gainsay it must be the great and gainful trade consider the short return that ever fall into our little island which commend to your worthy consideration I will conclude my discourse of trade with the courteous farewell that past betwixt our black merchant Buckor Sano and we they be earnest we will give a name unto the place we trade in that may remain as a memorial of of our be there I call it by the name of saint john mart which they repeat the place call st. John diverse time over to be perfect in and when our salt be go see we have away which we be careful to do fear less water in the river he in his affection will needs desire to go some little way along in our great boat pass about a mile our courteous part with Buckor Sano with we with courteous embrace we part shoot off three gun for his farewell not forget the drink of three or four cup and so put he on the shore from whence by hold up his arm he again salute we and with his hopeful expectation to see we there again I will let he rest and according to my course propound fall upon a merry company which be their juddy or as we may term they fiddler of the country neither the music they make or instrument they play upon deserve to have a better title and may sort also reasonable well to the company because at all especial meeting their devil Ho-re make on the relation whereof I proceed unto there be without doubt no people on the earth more natural affect to the sound of music than these people which the principal person do hold as a ornament of their state so as when we come to see they their music will seldom be want wherein they have a perfect resemblance to the irish rhymer sit in the same manner as they the fashion of the irish rhymer do upon the ground some what remote from the company and as they use sing of song unto their music the ground and effect whereof be the rehearsal of the ancient stock of the king exalt his antientry and recount over all the worthy and famous act by he or they have be achieve sing likewise extempore upon any occasion be offer whereby the principal may be please wherein diverse time they will not forget in our presence to sing in the praise of we white man for which he will expect from we some manner of gratification also if at any time the king or principal person come unto we trade in the river they will have their music play before they and will follow in order after their manner present a show of State they have little variety of instrument that which be most common in use be make of a great gourd and a neck thereunto fasten resemble in some sort our Bandora but they have no manner offret and the string they be either such as the place yield or their upon this instrument only they play with their finger invention can attain to make be very unapt to yield a sweet and musical sound notwithstanding with pin they wind and bring to agree in tuneable note have not above six string upon their great instrument in consortship with this they have many time another who play upon a little drum which he hold under his least arm and with a crooked stick in his right hand and his naked finger on the leave he strike the drum and a strange sort-ship with his mouth gape open make a rude noise resemble much the manner and countenance of those kind of distress people which among we be call changeling I do the rather recite this that it may please you to mark what opinion the people have of the man of this profession and how they dispose of they after they be dead but first I will acquaint you of their most principal instrument their chief instrument which be call Ballard make to stand a foot above the ground hollow under and have upon the top some seventeen wooden key stand like the organ upon which he that play sit upon the ground just against the middle of the instrument strike with a stick in either hand about a foot long at the end whereof be make fast a round ball cover with some soft stuff to avoid the clatter noise the bare stick will make and upon either arm he have great ring of iron out of which be wrought pretty handsome small iron to stand out who hold upon they small ring and juggle toy which as he stir his arm make a kind of musical sound agree to their barbarous content the sound that proceed from this instrument be worth the observe for we can hear it a good english mile the make of this instrument be one of the most ingenious thing among they for to every one of these key there belong a small iron the bigness of a quill and be a foot long the breadth of the instrument the manner of this instrument upon which hang two gourd under the hollow like bottle who receive the sound and return it again with that extraordinary loudness there be not many of these as we can perceive because they be not common but when they do come to any place the resort unto they be to be admire for both day and night more especial all the night the people continue dance until their manner of dance he that play be quite tire out the most desirous of dance be the woman who dance without man and but one alone with crooked knee and bend body they foot it nimble while the stander by seem to grace the dancer by clap their hand together after the manner of keep time and when the man dance they do it with their sword naked in their hand with which they use some action and both man a^^ woman when they have end their first dance (...) give somewhat unto the player whereby they be hold and esteem among they to be rich and their wife have their fiddler rich more crystal blue stone and bead about they than the king wife but if there be any licentious liberty it be unto these woman who outward carriage be such we may well conceit it and this one especial note howsoever the people affect music yet so base do they esteem of the player that when any of they die they do not vouchsafe they burial as other people have but set his dead corpse upright in a hollow tree where he be leave to consume when they have be demand a reason for so do they will answer they be a people they be base esteem of and be dead be not bury who have always a familiar conversation with their devil Ho-re and therefore they do so dispose of they which opinion of they cause we to neglect and especial in their hear to play upon any lute or instrument which some of we for our private exercise do carry with we in regard if they have happen to see we they will in a manner of scorn say he that play be a juddy the great resort of people with the most abundance of these juddy be at their time of cricumcision wherein they observe one due season and for that I desire herein to give a full relation I will follow my discourse with what I see and as a eye-witness be able to deliver I have set down before where I report the manner of our go up the river that I carry with i four black whereof the one be a boy or young youth who I call by the name of Samgully who in regard of his continuance with George tompson and after he with the rest of our company have learn to speak pretty Englis and withal have take such a affection towards we that he do seem even hearty to neglect father and mother and his own home in his desire to follow we he be about the age of 17. year a straight youthand of a handsome growth yet be he not circumcise how beit he shall have be the year before but his absence with the white people which be some of our company when the time of circumcision come be the only cause he miss cut they and this year he be to be circumcise or else there be some great penalty to light upon his friend or danger to himself which appear in their earnestness to keep he from go up with we notwithstanding he be steal beyond the town his friend dwell in with we as far as our boat will go in two tide and there overtake we his mother who on the shore make grievous the affection of Saingulley our black boy unto we moan to have he send back the boy have spy she and hide himself in the boat bid we say that he be go back and albeit her moan be great because she say he will be absent again in the time of circumcision which will be the next moon and if we will not put he on shore she will throw herself from the bank into the river the boy lie along in the boat say she will not drown she will not drown let we be go and alongst he go with we it be the eight day of january when his mother make this moan and the nine day of February after we come by that place again and that evening as the sun set come to a anchor at the port that belong to the town where the boy friend dwell which be call boh john town a man who we do well affect this Bornwell John be brother to Ferambra the town stand some mile from the water side to carry the boy home and refresh ourselves we be willing to walk on shore so take our chirurgeon and one more of my consort with our black Alchade who we hire from this town wherein his mother likewise dwell and our black boy ashore we go the bakne be high from the river which the boy first get up where present ascend he begin to leap and sing make great show of joy hold up his hand and point towards the town which as I say be a the feast of their circumcision mile from we but when we likewise ascend we hear a great noise of music and shoot where at the boy so much rejoice and say it be the cut of prick for so he call it and that he be come time enough we walk towards the town and as the evening go in come thither I have a intent to have go to the master of the town his house but my mary-buck tell i he have a world of stranger and be earnest with i to go to his mother house we be also to pass by the house where our black boy father and mother dwell the father in regard he be blind and keep house we see not but his mother be within and hear one call her son name come forth and meet he and present turn her head to the side of the house fall into a bitter weep call only upon his name Samgulley Samgulley I will have have the boy alongst where I lie but he be Samgulley take from we to be circumcise take from we and not suffer to go howbeit I charge he he shall not be cut which as they tell we be to be do in the morning until I come to see he which he promise and so we depart to our lodging at which place likewise be many people and much music but after a while that we have be there they all quit the place show a kind of modesttie not to disturb we there be no house nor dwelling but be full of people nay likewise under every shady and convenient tree there be great sire whereas there be their pot a seethe and their victual address and also their mat lay to take up their lodging sort themselves together in great company and in most place have music drum and dance make such a noise and din as may well proceed from such kind of actor and among they likewise they have commerce one the great resort to this solemnity thing for another so as it have a manner of resemblance to our fair here in England neither be there want of any manner of provision for as much as all kind of people that come thither bring some manner of sustenance with they and the people of the place do provide and reserve themselves against this time so as I may well say it have a right resemblance to our country among the rest of these disperse company I take special notice of one who stand more remote and be close and sever in under the shady tree which reed and bow set up together like a hedge from whence proceed a great noise of voice as also drum and thump more clamoros demand what it mean I be answer in that place remain those youth that they that be cut keep all together be cut and they be to continue until such time as they be recover of their soreness and that the greatness of the noise do come from those people who keep they company which be the young sort of people above their age who have already past and receive their circumcision I go likewise that night after we have sup to the master of the town house who have send unto i to mend my supper a brace of partidge and find there the Ballard or best music and the young sort of woman gather together behold their dance and for that they may see we have such pleasure among we I take one of they by the hand and dance with she whereof they give testimony the courtesy and that past betwixt we of great gladness invite the rest of my company to do the like boh John the master of the place excuse himself that we lay not at his house in regard of much company and noise but more especial because one of his wife be late deliver of a child unto who he carry i within a house by herself where she lie after their fashion upon a mat handsome I give unto the mother for the child a few poor bead which be very thankful take and he say if it have be a man child it shall have have one of our co upany name with who he have be long acquaint but say he my wife dowry be with child and if she bring a man child it shall carry your name for so she earnest desire these familiarity pass betwixt we after which we betake ourselves to our several lodging and be nothing fright with the roar cry of their devil who at these ceremonious meeting so soon as evening come be conversant by his roar voice among they and so continue all or the most part of the night whereof I shall present give you relation but first I must conclude of their circumcision for the sight whereof as even now I tell you we do reserve ourselves to receive advertisement of our samgulleye cut which be to be do in the morning and according the sun some two hour high we have a messenger come to entreat we will send he a white cloth and that he will pray we to come and see he as soon as we come he be bring forth into the open field between the house and the place where they remain who be cut the day before they have take away his clothes they bring he ashore in which be shirt breech and a cap of strip stuff after the brave fashion of the country and only bring he with a white cloth close about he whereas we do expect some great ceremony after a religious manner to be perform he be first set down upon a little molehill diverse people come forth to see he among the which be most woman who stand direct a little woman look upon the circumcision distance off look on the master of the town be likewise there and three of we among which our chirurgeon be one to comfort he not to fear he be very confident entreat i to lay my hand upon his shoulder from among the black come forth a ordinary man with a short knife in his hand which he whet as he come like one of our butcher unto a beast and cause the boy to stand up he take of his cloth give it to a slander by to hold so as he be stark naked and set his hand upon his side be neither bind nor hold how be it there be some by who offer to hold his arm but because he promise not to move they let he alone the executioner take hold of his member draw the skin over very far as we conceive cut he large and have three several cut afore he have do whereat the boy our boy circumcisise and the manner thereof shrink very little insomuch as the master of the town who stand by tell we he have very seldom see any abide it with so great a courage to our think it be exceed fearful and full of terror insomuch as I tell the doer in a very angry manner he have utter spoil he when he ask wherein I reply in cut he so deep his answer be it be so much the better for he and without any curiosity take up his cloth show his own member that it may appear he be cut as far howbeit my distaste be such upon he that I can not yield to give he any thing in the way of gratuity to wash his hand withal and as the manner of the country be to do by such as be friend to the party circumcise the thing perform the boy white cloth be cast over he and by two man who hold his arm he be hurry apace to the same quarter where the other that be cut remain we make first a request that they will let we go along to the place with he and be go with some of the people but present in haste overtake we four ancient man who do not only stay our go but make show of much we be not suffer to go among the new circumcise displeasure to such as be go with we and will by no mean suffer we shall come among they then we desire we may have the boy away with we tell they we have better mean to cure he and to make he soon well than they have show our chirurgeon unto they who they know have heal no use of medicine to cure they wound and sore among they but we can not prevail by the interpose of these ancient man some of the rest seem to consent unto we so as we be there drive to leave our boy who among the restof his comfort have without doubt no other chirurgery to cure their tender malady but only to attend the expectation of time who by the help of their youth and nature may wear it out which appear the rather to we in regard at these time there be unto these youth allow a certain licentious liberty whereby they may steal and take away people hen or poultry nay from the fulby a beef or cattle to eat and banquet withal among themselves without any offence to the law or government of the country which at other time be strict in that behalf thereby animate and encourage their spirit to more alacrity and according to the condition of their wanton age by these steal delight to draw they more willing from the thing and make the time of their recovery less tedious to themselves and discourageable to other and if I may be worthy to deliver my opinion consider this their circumcision as I have careful observe I shall conclude it be do of mere necessity as a moral law for the preservation of their life and health and so find out by their precedent ancestor and by strict observation lay peremptory upon they wherein I shall submit myself in the account I can give to more able judgement only this you may please to note it be do without any religious ceremony and the word in their language be express unto we by no other signification then cut of prick and this be do in certain big town of the country whether the small town and habitation make their resort bring their youth to be all cut together and to make up the number at all these meeting there be one sure card that never fail which be their the discourse of their devil Ho-re roar devil that before I speak of who attendance may seem to keep the youth in awe and he be call by the name of Ho-re who strange report I proceed unto there be at all these meeting some distance of from the place hear the noise of a roar voice resemble the great base of a man voice when we demand of they what it be they will answer with a kind of fear it be Ho-re and then describe he to be a fearful spirit that none may come near without danger of be destroy carry away or tear in piece there be at all their meeting upon the first notice of his voice a preparation for he of all manner of victual they have among they every one impart somewhat all which be carry towards the voice and there under he be a monstrous cater a tree set down and within small time be it of what quantity soever it will be find devour and not so much as a bone to be see uneaten or leave behind and if they be not ready forthwith to carry he such provision as shall content he some of their uncircumcised son be instant take away female he meddle not with and say to remain in ho-reyes belly some of they nine or ten day from whence sumetimes 8 or 9 be carry away and say to be in his belly they must be redeem with some belly provision and it be strange to hear how confident they will report unto you that they have be carry away and be abide there wherein this be observe that look how many day he have be keep away or remain as they say in ho-reyes belly so many day after they return it must be before they will or dare open their mouth to speak a word for confirmation of which this I have see as I walk one day into the country from our dwell to house distant some four mile in the way we be to pass through a town of the fulby among the people that look upon we I be show a youth of some eighteen year of age who they say come but the night before out of ho-reyes belly I go towards he and urge he to speak come forth they speak not for certain day unto i but still he go back from i and keep his finger before his mouth and notwithstanding I make what mean I can by pull and pinch of he and more to terrify he make proffer with a false fire to shut at he be natural exceed fearful of our gun I can not prevail neither make he open his mouth notwithstanding afterward the same fellow do often come and have commerce among we nay our people who be lie and dwell in the country have be at several time fright with the voice of this ho-rey for have stay in their fowl or be abroad until night have overtake they in their come home as they have say they have hear the voice of Ho-re as they may conceive some mile from they and before they can pass ten step he have seem to be in their very back with fright whereof maintain by their imagination of their report go of he they have not without a ghastly dread recover home unto which place of dwell he never be so bold to make any attempt and very my opinion be that it be only some illusion either by the marybucke or among the elder sort to form and keep in obedience those young sort for better approbation of what I suppose I will crave the patience to set down what I observe at the circumcision of our black boy the night be our opinion concern Ho-re very light the moon be then about the full towards midnight come from Bornwell john house to the place at say ho-reyes voice be wondrous busy as it seem to i not far of I speak unto my consort we will secret take our arm and steal down to see what it be one of our three be backward and unwilling whereby it come to pass our marybucke understand what we intend who come earnest unto i entreat I will give over that dangerous attempt say I can not find he for one cry will be hard by i and another instant beyond the river which be a mile of and there be great danger he will carry i into the river with he when he perceive he can not alter my resolution he hold i by the arm and point to a black not far from i hold down his head I go to that man be a very lusty fellow to speak unto he who voice be grow so horse by cry like Ho-re he have no utterance whereupon I return to my marybucke how he be partly discover and say there be one of your devil who with a smile go his way from i but that the devil have great recourse among they be without question especial as I note before with the rhymer or juddye I will specify one intelligence we have and so leave he there among they when we come first up the river we be uncertain of our own time much less than any other can six hour of go stay or come to a place howbeit we be to come to a town call pompetane at which place a example of the devil converse with the fiddler dwell a Portugal call jasper who have a young kinsman with he call Marko but no woman but black this dwell of his be the high by many league of any Portugal in the river and very fair quart ever past betwixt we we come to this place the 14. of December between eight and nine in the morning and notwithstanding the dwell house be somewhat remote from the river we find stand upon the bank at the land place this who in friendly sort salute we and carry we up to his house where present we find ready a very good breakfast of hen and other good refresh which he say be provide for we we seem to marvel he shall know of our come thither but aster he tell we that the evening before he be at another town within the land and have no meaning to come home when as there come unto he a juddy ot Fidler which dwell in the town with he and do likewise show we the man who tell he that Ho-re have acquaint he that the next morning and at such a hour there will be so many white man at Pompetane name the number that be in our boat and that there they will land but to what purpose either to do good or hurt the devil be ignorant and upon the devil can not tell the Portugal where we be friend or foe this intelligence I retire myself and come away hither to meet you whereat we seem much to wonder be altogether ourselves uncertain of any hour in regard we diverse time go a shore and shoot at foul and such like occasion diverse time light upon we notwithstanding the devil intelligence we be no way discomfort for he do confess he be altogether ignorant of our intend action and the conclusion be how by his intelligence the worst hurt we have be a better and more ready breakfast it follow concern what trade or occupation be in use among they whereof we note only three the first and chief be the Ferraro or Smith who hold a good repute notwithstanding they have no iron of their own make but what be the trade or occupation they have in use their painful season of thunder and lightning also what fruit and plant the country yield and be grow there among they bring unto they whereof they have most needesull use and neither may or can live without it for first of the iron we bring unto they they do fashion and make all those short sword they be next the head of their assigy or javelin as also the head of their throw dart and the barb head of their shoot arrow which be cover over with their deadly poison in many of these the smith do show a pretty kind of art and make but the most needful use among they be the tool or instrument wherewith they till their ground without use of which they can hardly have their the smith be and therefore iron a principal commodity that they do call upon at the low part of the river where the Portugal frequent they have more for exchange then above whereas we be upon a certain trade for we cut our iron of twelve ynche and that be the proportion look after and so high as it flow the king and governor will call for that length but pass above eight yuche will go as friendly which in either of they be gain enough the return even in the worst yield ten for one carry our iron in bar we be enforce to make use of their smith to cut it to the proportion we must use and therefore send for he he come to the water side bring his shop with he that be his bellows and a small anvil which he strike into the ground under a shady tree and only of one kind a excellent charcoal to work their iron of red wood among they they can make artificial charcoal which will give our iron his true heat as any seacoal his boy blow the bellows that lie on the ground the nose of they through a hard earth make of purpose with a hole in it and in this manner with a hammer and a tool they cut it for we receive satisfaction to we easy enough but what it be consist of iron and chary we must be to look to our measure or he will use his best understanding to purloin and this for the smith and his esteem among they the next be he who we call a Sepatero one that do make all their Gregory wherein the Sepatero they of this trade be most ingenious true be a great deal of art show they be make and fashion of leather into all shape both round and square and triangle after that neat manner as may be allow for workmanship even among our curious handicraft these man be likewise they that make their saddle and bridle of which bridle I have see so neat make up as with leather even here in our own country can hardly be mend whereby appear they have knowledge to dress their leather howbeit I conceive only their goat and dear skin which they can colour and die but to great beast hide their apprehension can attain and some of these be hold for curious person and deep capacity for they will be feeling of some stuff garment we wear and do think and will bold say that we do make they of the hide we buy from they and will not do it in their sight because they shall not learn and for our paper we bring they absolute conclude it be make of the hyde and likewise many other thing they see we use they will say come and be frame of those elephant tooth we carry from they allow much of a more deep knowledge in we than themselves in many thing apply it amiss and to impossibility another profession we find and those be they who temper the earth and make the wall of their house and likewise earthen pot they set to the fire to boil and dress their food in for all other occasion they use no other mettle but serve themselves with the gourd which perform it very neat the potter and tobacco pipemaker only one principal thing they canoot miss and that be their tobacco pipe whereof there be few or none of they be they man or woman do walk or go without they do make only the bowl of earth with a neck of the same about two inch long very nea^ly and artificial colour or glaze the e^^^h very handsome all the bowl be very great and fo^ the most part will hold half a ounce of tobacco they put into the neck a long kane many time a yard of length and in that manner draw their smoke whereof they be great taker and can of all other thing live without it these be the 3 profess trad other thing they they have in the high of the river excellent mat need and that be in use among they be common to every man to do or make as his occasion require whereof the most especial in use be mat such as they eat their meat upon sit upon and also make their bed have no other thing indeed to lie upon and therefore as we right term it be the staple commodity they have among they while we be in the river at a place call mangegar against which we have occasion to ride with our ship both up and down in the open field about a mile distance from any house be every Monday a market keep which be in the middle of the week unto which will come great resort of people from round about as here in our country a market keep every Monday who will disperse and settle themselves with their commodity under the shady tree and take up a good space of ground and any thing what the country do yield be there bring in and buy and sell among they now through the whole country there be no use of any coin or money neither have they any but every man to no money or coin among they chop and barter one thing for another and the only nominate thing be mat as in ask the price of this or that I desire the word be how many mat shall I give you so as they be still in use and these be the several trade and manner of course the common people follow or have among they and so I pass to their laborious travel and general trade among they from which none be exempt but the king and principal person themselves or such as by age be past their labour otherwise all the mary-buck both priest and people and of all size as they be able put to their hand to till the earth and sow their corn and for that the goodness of God unto we may the more appear and the reader stir up the rather to all labour to till the earth and sow their grain acknowledge his mercy let we call to mind the word which God say unto Adam after his fall in paradise in the sweat of thy brow shall thou eat thy bread and with care and sorrow shall thou eat it and acknowledge these people to abide the curse indeed and ourselves mitigate through his merciful favour for the earth likewise receive s^^^^se do natural bring forth unprofitable thing whereby man be force for his necessary sustenance to till and plant the same now God have lend and give unto we the beast of the field which likewise they enjoy but he have endue we with a understanding and knowledge to make the beast and cattle to serve and obey our will in plough and open the earth thereby ease and as it be take away the sweat of our brow they understand not to make their cattle work which knowledge he have deny unto they and not withstand they have so many herd of fit cattle they understand not to make use of they but even with their own hand in the true sweat of their brow do they follow their painful labour as I here relate it they reserve great field to sow their corn in which they raise up in furrow as decent as we do here but all their labour be with their hand have therein a short stick of some yard in length upon the end whereof be put a broad iron like unto our paddle staff which iron set into the ground one lead the way carry up the earth before he so many other follow after he with their several iron do as he lead as will raise up a sufficient furrow which follow to the end of the ground they the manner of their painful labour begin again in this painful and laborious manner fit the earth for the grain wherein our old proverb be to be allow of many hand make light work otherwise it will appear a most tedious kind of labour they have six several sort of grain they do feed upon amongst which none be know to we by name I mean here in their co^ or grain England but only rice the other may rather be call a kind of seed then corn be of as small a grain as mustard seed neither do they make any bread but boil their grain roll it up in ball as I have say before and so eat it warm in like sort they boil their rice and eat it warm and even to we it be a very good and able sustenance all other grain be sow the ground be with their iron spadle over and so leave to his growth but in rice they do set it first in small patch of low the manner of their rice marish ground and after it do come up disperse the plant and set they in more spacious place which they prepare for it and it do yield a great increase they do likewise observe their season to set other plant as tobacco which be ever grow about their house and likewise with great carefulness they prepare the ground to set the the plant of cotton seed of the Cotten wool whereof they plant whole field and come up as rose grow it bear cod and as they ripen the cod break and the wool appear which show the time of gather and before I pass to speak of other natural plant that proceed and come forth without labour I must not omit to relate here the far misery of this labour people that thereby we may discern the great mercy we do enjoy for whereas it bathe please God to afford unto we seasonable time to plant and sow and again to reap and enjoy our labour send likewise the misery of the people gentle shower and reins whereby we receive they in a due season he have not deal so with all nation whereof these be witness for although their season be certain yet they be violent and fearful for from September unto the latter end of May follow almost nine month they never taste any shower of rain so as their ground be so hard through the extreme heat of the sun that they can make no use thereof but be compel to stay until rain do fall to moisten the earth that their instrument may enter to prepare the same which rain at the first come gentle now and then a shower but not without thunder and lightning towards the end of june it than grow more forcible pour itself violent forth with such horrible storm and gust of wind and with such fearful flash of lightning and clap of thunder as if according to our phrase heaven and earth will meet together in all which notwithstanding the time of their reins and the fearfulness thereof the miserable people be drive to work and labour in the open field for joose the season of the ground softness and as it do begin after a more gentle manner in the same nature and distance of time it pass away the most extreme force be from the middle of july until the middle of August and the abundance of rain that then do fall may be suppose in that it do raise the river from his usual height direct upright thirty foot and where it have not bank to defend it overflows the shore and therefore they prepare their habitation in their own discretion according and in some year not without danger now in regard many people of our country have be lose and that our seaman direct charge the unholsomnesse of the air to be the sole cause I will presume a little to argue it deliver my opinion hope it may invite some able understanding to search into it and produce some better assistance to avoid the inconvenience than I be able to deliver a fair entreaty to man of judgement it be certain in regard of the ground hardness in those nine month when the reins be past that the superficies or upper part of the earth do receive all that venom or poisonous humour which distil either from tree or plant whereof there be store as we see by the abundance they use in poison their arrow and some of their lance and likewise what do issue from their venomous serpent and snake of which kind there be very many both great and exceed long also toad and scorpion the poison do remain and continue in the the great abundance of poison dryness of the ground and rake up in the dust and sand which upon the first reins be moisten and the earth wet by the exhalation of the hot sun be draw up and in short time in the next shower fall down again in my poor judgement some reason appear that those first time must be very pestilent and full of danger which in some sort testifi be itself in regard those first reins light upon the naked body do make blain and spot which remain aster they much more than after the reins have continue and more perfect wash and clear the supersicy and not only upon the body but in the garment the nature of the first reins or clothes wear who be lay by after they be wet with the first reins do soon and in great number breed and bring forth untoward worm whereas other way after the reins be more common it do not produce any such effect or if it do very little to this I say that it be a thing to be especial observe as much as man may to avoid the be in those first reins and more especial to be provide of water either to drink or dress meat withal before these season fall except it be a observation to be keep those who dwell and abide upon the land and may have mean to cover and keep close their spring but for man to water in those pestilent time and in the open river as the saint john man in their first voyage do I say it be a desperate attempt and may have be the confusion of they all as indeed there be but few of they escape and that the country be not so contagious as they will have their report to make it those people of we may be witness who be willing to stay behind and remain there almost three year there be not one of they die but return all into their own country be eight of they in number except only a note of experience captain tompson who as I repeat before be slay by unhappy accident I will willing also venture here and speak my opinion what natural may be say concern these contagious time but with this proviso it be do to animate other who if they know the certain course and season with the true manner of each particular circumstance will be able to demonstrate better and so rectify i in that where I shall do amiss these season I say begin gentle in the end of May when the sun draw to the end of his northern progress in the tropic of cancer who power as it may appear draw up after he those a observation of the tempestuous time great and cloudy vapour which direct come perpetual out of the southeast and from no other place or point which follow after the force of the sun as they rise high and near the heat begin to dissolve but as the sun turn back again and come in his reverse to meet with these massy vapour send in his forceable reins among those cloudy substance compel they to give way and break in sunder the violence whereof produce that terrible thunder and fearful lightning which follow and great abundance of rain which fall which as it do appear be most terrible when the sun and those vapour be as it be incorporate for from the middle of july until the middle of August the extremity be and by that time in September the sun be again in his equinoctial the air do clear and all the storm do end and so it appear that as the sun after his come from the equinoctial in his whole northern progress be raise and draw these vapour after so in his reverse again from the tropic until he come to the equinoctial he be dissolve and clear the same again all which observe as a natural man I commend to the ingenious practitioner either to amend or make use of and in they hear and speak of Christ but will not believe myself with humble thankfulness give glory to God who show his almighty power to theseunbeleeve people that in regard they will not accept of that please and peaceful intelligence of our love and meek saviour his bless son they shall feel and fear his omnipotent power in tremble under those incomprehensible terror which as he say in job be prepare for his enemy again if it have please he to appoint certain place upon the earth where more especial those great and fearful work of he shall appear thereby to daunt and keep down the haughty aspire of sinful man how much be God mercy to we we bind to praise and acknowledge his everlasting goodness in not seat we and our habition under those contagious climate and how much more be his great power manifest that have appoint bound and limit as he say himself of the swell sea so likewise of these fearful season hitherto shall you come and shall exceed no further and now to add comfort unto we that be or shall be call to travel these part first the time and season be certain that man may either avoid they by leave the country when they be to come or by prepare themselves with thing necessary be the better able to endure they when they be come of which now we have have such experience as we can expound thing outward by God permission requisite and availcable and inward frame our body and disposition to the country and season agreeable and this be encourage with a comfortable resolution that the continuance be not long and that we know the end and termination of the season which before experience a comfort to the traveller be a fearful discourager so I return back to speak of the natural plant which follow the laborious course I be drive to omit they have natural grow which be but only near the mouth of the river Bononos avery excellent fruit and they be as delicious good and great as any that be in the west indies likewise within that limit store of small lemon or lyme and for orange limb we have see and have bring unto we far up in the river at some time good store that show orange there be tree in the country and that they may be store if the people be ingenious and either will or can know how to plant they but to speak of thing that the whole country yield plentiful and what be esteem and set by among they whereof especial we note Palmeta tree and in some place there be whole ground or grove of they the use whereof be to draw from they a most sweet and pleasant drink which we call Palmeta wine and as we approve and like of it to be toothsome so likewise in good wine forth of a tree operation we find it wholesome the manner whereof be this they do cut into the body of the tree hole in some more in some less as the tree be in substance to whichhole they place a hollow cane cut slope to go the neatly in into which the juice of the tree distil and be convey as in pipe unto gourd set handsome into the ground ready to receive it which be in less than twenty four hour take away and as they please dispose of now this be of that esteem that the vulgar sort may not meddle with but the principal person and therefore they will send of this unto we four or five mile distance as a courteous present the taste whereof do true resemble white wine when it come first over into England have the same sweetness of taste and in colour if they be together not to be distinguish only this be the misery it will not keep above one day for if you reserve of it until the morning it will grow sour notwithstanding any diligence that can be use and of this kind there be several sort and taste as there be in white wine which the people themselves distinguish by several name call some Sabbagee Bangee Tangee several sort thereof Palmeta apple and other name as the tree be from whence it come some Palmeta tree do likewise carry great store of apple which the country people will feed upon especial the young sort and be enter into their good liquor I must not forget to speak of the knowledge they have in make a compound drink which we can afford to taste and accept of and it be make of some corn amade drink call Dullo boil and order as we do our ale they call it dullo it be not common among they but when the king or principal person will make a feast he call all the inhabitant about he and have a great gourd or two sometime three of this liquor in his presence they drink round and it be divide among they make a end of all before they part and it be of that operation it will warm their brain and set their tongue a work the poor Fulbye find that we affect it will many time watch for a private conveyance but if the black meet with he they will sure drink it and send he home again have lose his market now because I speak of gourd which be grow thing it be fit I tell you they do grow and resemble just that we call our pompion and in that manner be place and carry upon their wall and house be of all manner of different sort from Gowrdes no big than a egg to those that will hold a bushel and the necessary use they have of they to eat and drink and wash their clothes in with diverse other very fit occasion give than just cause to preserve they although the meat or substance that grow within they be to be throw away in regard of the extreme bitterness whereof the shell itself so savour as no use can be make until it be perfect season and they have likewise grow pumpion in the self same manner we have and in like case they do convert to sustenance but to rise high from the ground they have likewise great store of locust tree which grow in cluster of long cod together in the begin of May grow to his ripeness which the people will seed upon especial the young sort if they can make shift to get they down the tree be big and of a good height with this I must join honey which do appear likewise to grow and the country be very full wherein the people use one of the ingenious part I see among they for upon those great tree which be grow about their house in many place you shall have they make basket of reed and sedge which they will make fast on the out bow of the tree and in those the bee wild honey will come and breed whereof in time they receive the profit have so many basket on some convenient tree that in our ignorance before we know it be distant of we may conceit it be some fruit the tree have yield also in hole of hollow tree among the wood still bee be plenty so that another John baptist if any be may in this place and that with plenty receive his full of locust and wild honey and for tree of great and large body they be here especial one sort which do carry upon a long stalk a great and round fruit yield a kind of please pith within whereupon the baboon monkey meat and munkye use to feed whereof there have need be store in regard of their number as I shall declare hereafter and some of these tree retain that bigness that six man by fathome can hardly compass there be other huge tree one whereof do carry a stony apple which be through ripe to eat be tolerable and serve if he fall to feed the wild a stony apple swine but that be in place where the baboon be a stranger and I will conclude their fruit with that which be in most esteem among they which be a fruit in proportion much like our big sort of chestnut flat on both side but have no hard shell on the outside they call they Gola and we nut the taste of he when he be bite be extreme bitter but the this fruit be of great esteem operation of he be with they so set by that ten be a present for a king this operation we find that after we have eat of he down notwithstanding his bitter taste the water we drink present after although it he out of the river shall have a relish like white wine carry that sweetness as if it be mix with sugar and likewise the tobacco we take present after shall have that sweetness one will much admire other operation we find none yet so do they esteem they that the ancient person have lose their tooth and not able to bite it have mortar wherewithal carry to bruise it that they may not be bar of the juice and comfort of it neither be they for the common people fifty of these nut in the habitation where we dwell present to the king will buy a wife and many time as a wonderful great present I have have six of they send i howbeit we never see any of they grow neither be they as they say among they but bring from they be not grow within the limit we see another people and they be of most value still the low and near the mouth yet there they be and the portugese will make as if they bring they into the river by a trade they have in a great bay beyond Cacho where they meet with a people that great store bring we when we be above bring they gold and many of these nut and this we can say that when we be at the high part of the river the people bring they abundant unto we and do wonder much we make no more esteem or care to buy they but where they grow or whence they have they we be yet ignorant although the Portugal affirm they come from the golden country neither will they last or continue by any knowledge we have to keep they be subject to wither or be eat with worm as by trial I prove keep of they to have show in England as I much desire they have neither onion nor garlic howbeit garlic be a thing they much desire wherewith we see they rather rub their head and body then affect to feed on neither have they any herb or flower which either for taste or smell they esteem but only one call Binning which carry a sharp or sour taste like sampire we use for this be like our water Lilly sauce and that they see will ordinary bring unto we howbeit when we come upon diverse mountain and sundry wood we shall retain such sweet sinell as will be very please from whence we conclude the bee do gather and make up their honey and I will make my conclusion of the plant among they with that which unto i bring admiration which be a tree or bush common grow upon the top of the river bank resemble much our great barbery bush only have a little ragged leaf whereunto come with all the diligence may be devise not to touch or move it but only with all gentleness between your finger and thumb touch a leaf the whole bow shall present close up every lease together as if they fear and find themselves offend but if you touch or stir a little sprig the whole tree shall close his leaf after a most sensible manner the sensible tree whereof take especial notice we do allow it to be the sensible tree of which ancient author have write which we do observe to carry a kind of yellow flower like our hedge rose with the strangeness whereof concern plant I here conclude my story the discourse of the wild beast and now I be to speak of the wild beast the country be store withal whereof I be to begin with those that be ravenous and offensive keep the people in dread and as his pleasure require the lion be first whereof there be very many which we can speak by perfect knowledge although we can say eye-witness for our gracious God have so ordain that those beast which be most tyrannous all revenous beast in the day time keep their den to other and bold against man as ashamed of their bloody action notwithstanding their ableness and strength do shut themselves up in the bowel of the earth all the day time as it be confine from the glorious light of the sun be one of God comfortable creature so that in the night be their time of walk and our knowledge of they be by their roar and noise they make whereby one beast be distinguish from a other but the lion be more especial to be take the Lyon notice of beside his own voice in regard of a servant he have sometime two or three that do attend he which we do call the little jack all it be a little black shagge-heard beast about the bigness his small servant of a small spaniel which so soon as the evening come hunt and busle about for the prey and come on the foot follow the send with open cry to which the lion be master huntsman give diligent ear and apply himself to follow for his own ease and advantage if it so happen the jack all beweary or set up his chase besot the lion come in he howl main out to show the estate he stand in and then come the haughty lion and seize one the weary prey for as it be write of the lion in his pride if he sail his manner of hunt of his prey at three jump he scorn to pursue or toil himself after it and be seize he remain feed make a kind of grumble noise while his small servant stand bark and yalp by attend until his master have feast and then he fall upon the remainder and this as we hear and receive from the country people so likewise it be affirm unto we by our own ttavaile for as we have occasion when the tide fall out to travail up the river in the night and likewise many time to the cause of our knowledge ride all night at a anchor in the river against desert place we do observe the noise and hunt of this jack all and likewise note the reply and answer of the lion insomuch as it be a commonn word among we who will go on shore and accompany the master huntsman there be ounce and leopard great store whereof by reason of the many den we see upon the land we may discern the print of the foot remain upon the hole mouth be able to assure we what be within as also the country people do bring many of their skin unto we to sell how ever ounce and leopard they light upon they for by their own valour sure they dare not and by their ingenious capacity I believe they can devise any course to lessen their company the ounce do seem to be more ravenous or dangerous unto they than either lion the ounce dangerous or any other and make more spoil upon they as they do complain I be show a child there which the mother give suck unto who early in a morning go near to her house to a spring to fetch water have lay her child wrap in a cloth without her door upon a mat as they use to do and there come a hungry ounce who it seem have miss his night prey and take up the cloth and child and run his way the mother meet he and with woeful outcry pursue he and as it chance a true tale of a child he take the way to come right upon the place where the father of the child with other people be labour in the field who with roar voice run after he the ounce still run away keep his hold but as it chance the child drop forth of the cloth and the father run after recover it and take it up the ounce carry clean away the cloth and the man bring back the child to the mother the which we ourselves have both see and handle and so bold and fierce be the ounce that many time in the night he have drive a small dog we have where we dwell on shore to our bedside by a hole he have through our straw wall bark and run under our bed not dare to look out howsoever we encourage he until we be fain with firebrand in our hand to go abroad and so fear he away and many more be there of night enemy which watch and look after their careful huswisery among which especial be the great civet cat civit cat. porcupine and the Porcupin who be careful purueigher for any outlie poultry who view early in the morning be their discovery the cat by the print of their foot leave in the sand and the porcupine by his quill which be shed and many time take up in plenty and so I end with their night enemy and as I stand conceit cruel acquaintance because what after I deliver be upon such beast as walk and show themselves by day and howsoever they stand in fear of they it be rather out of a timorousness in the people than any willingness in the beast the first where of be the elephant who presence indeed as he be a wild beast may even to a strong person give a just amazement and such be the fear the country people in general have of they that by all possible mean they seek to shun and fly from they yet such be the great abundance the the elephant country do yield of they that they be over all place and wheresoever you come you shall find the foot and apparent show they have be there though not present to be see and notwithstanding those great abundance of wild one they have not any of they tame or under command as in other place of the world they have which certain proceed from the fear they conceive of they much and great be the spoil they do they both among their corn and especial in their cotton ground go in small company together whereof I have see sixteen very great one beside young one that suck and other that be of middle stature the proportion the stature of the great one of the great I leave you thus to conjecture of the reed or sedge that grow natural in every place be high above our head than the arm of a tall man can well reach and half the body of those elephant be above the reed their natural feed be amongst this sedge but more especial they do browse upon tree whereof in the wood you shall find store by they pull down and that of big body and round substance the manner he browse like a dear whereof I must relate to correct the mistake which be most common in picture the elephant who two great tooth be common set in his low law carry they upward as a boar do his tusk which be contrary for he carry they downward and with they break down the tree for after with his trunk he have bend the top he haspe over his two tooth so as one or other must needs give way and that be the reason that among those multitude of tooth that be bring over so many break tooth and crack and shake be among they for it the tree be too strong the tooth give way and so the people find many junk and piece which they sell unto we and the abundance of those tooth that be yearly bring from thence may satisfy what store of these beast be in the country for as I have speak with many who consider the great store be bring away have a false opinion conceive they have shed their tooth as stag do mew their horn which direct be nothing so but by the death of the beast the tooth be get what casual death they be subject unto we be ignorant and for any practice of the people too much fear possess they so far as we have see one place alone except which I will manifest unto you within four mile where our habitation be there stand a good spacious plantation the commander whereof we call Ferambra who be always a friend of we as we be in our dwell upon our Christmas day at dinner this be that Ferambra I note before where God be praise we have variety of meat to mend our fare just in the dinner time there come four black people unto we whereof two be lade and have great gourd upon their head as much as they can stand under the one full of Palmeta wine the other of raw flesh which be present send i from this Ferambra who send elephant flesh good to feed upon i word he have kill a elephant and have send i some part thereof our dainty stomach look asquash at such gross flesh yet I receive it kind and give it away to our black neighbour who eat it very merry the next day I go to house and the fashion of the country be to entertain we with their best provision of diet among which we have elephant flesh whereupon both myself and consort that be with i feed very hearty and find it good and savoury meat I desire to know how he kill they and he show i one of his black people and say there be none but he alone dare do it and take down a lauclin the manner how he kill they which hang in the house the staff some ten foot long the iron or head whereof be bind up in a cloth which he open and show i and it be lay with poison all over he say his manner be when he see the elephant feed in the high sedge he will steal in among they and by creep still keep himself behind they he will recover so near as to strike his javelin into the body of the beast and leave it there take to his heel and through the long reed escape away and the warm blood dissolve the poison upon the javelin it present spread itself to the cruel torture of the beast the extremity whereof kill he the people in the mean time upon tree and place of advantage be set round about to watch he and so soon as he be down come to he present cut away so much of the flesh as be inflame with the poison which they throw away reserve the rest for their own sustenance and in this manner he have kill i so many as you see I have tail here hang up and except I bring two of these tail away with i in this place I never hear but the people be wondrous fearful of they the experience whereof be in those black people I have in my boat when I go up the river it be my manner as I can with conveniency to adventure and set upon such as we meet withal but my black will always tremble and run away and many several attempt I have upon they wherein I must say as I find that they be as fearful as a forest stag and according to their greatness go as the elephant a fearful beast swift from we as they can which pace be fast than a good able man can run whereof I have trial in one great beast who notwithstanding we have shoot three time the blood run down his side escape away from we that we lose he who afterward the people find dead and bring his tooth to sell unto we and have we be provide according we may have make diverse prey upon the people admiration we dare set upon they they but what we do be hold in admiration amongst the people for many will come down on purpose to look upon we and dernaund of our black which be he that dare set upon a elephant there be also in the country Buffelos which be wild bull and cattle of that sort also wild boor very huge and great their colour be Buffelos a dark blue and without doubt he be a very dangerous blue boor beast for he show more boldness than any other be arm with great and large tusk and carry up his tuft tail of a great length bolt upright in a scornful manner will walk from we there be likewise large Antelops and dear of Antelops dear of all sort all manner of sort spread over the whole country with beast of that kind who name we be ignorant of and many strange hide they do bring unto we among which there be one beast who hide be fourteen foot of length of a dun colour and stroke with white another sort I must needs remember who great abundance may well put i in mind beside their society and neighbourhood which in our travel up the river we be often acquaint withal which be the babowne and monkey whereof the country have innumerable monkey store and where they be they do go in herd and company but be of two society the monkey always keep by themselves and great and little as they be only of that kind consort together and even in land that lie within the river they be as frequent as on the main which condemn the report be of they that they can swim but be in the water will drown present and in my own knowledge I can affirm that have buy a monkey from the country people who use to bring they unto we and sell they for poor thing be get loose in my boat that rid in the middle of the river he leap into the water to swim on shore and be pursue by one of our man who swim after he he do dive under water diverse and sundry time before he can recover he babowne a strange story but to speak of the babowne I must say it be a wonderful thing to observe a kind of commonwealth that be among they they have none but their own kind together and be in herd of three or four thousand in a company as they travel they go in rank whereof the leader be certain of the great sort and there be as great and large of they as a lion the small follow and ever now and then as a commander a great one walk the female carry their young under their belly except she have two and then one under the other above in the rear come up a great company of the big sort as a guard against any pursue enemy and in this manner do they march along they be very bold and as we pass in the river when we come near their troop they will get up into the tree and stand in gaze upon we and in a kind of choleric humour the great one will shake the tree and with his hand clatter the bough in that fashion as it do exceed the strength of a man to do the like bark and make a noise at we as if they be much offend and in this manner many time they will follow we along and in the night time where we ride at a anchor take up their stand or lodging on the mountain top or on the tree that be above we whereas we hear their government a government among they for many time in the night you shall hear such a noise of many of their voice together when instant one great voice exalt itself and present all be hush and the noise be dash so as we be wont to say master Constable speak likewise when we be a shore and meet with these troop on a sudden the great one will come forward and seem to grin in our face but offer up a gun and away they pack one of our people one day as we come near the shore in our boat and a troop of these shaver be gaze on we make a shot and kill one of they which before the boat can get on shore the other have take up betwixt they and carry quite away but we have kill of they which the country people do much desire and will eat very hearty wherein I hope never to take their part and last let i tell the people of the country eat they you that we have see in the desert place they use tree and plant wound and make up together in that artificial manner and wrought together with that thickness over head to keep away the sun and shade the ground which have be beat and smooth under neath and all thing in the manner and shape of a excellent arbour which place they have only use and keep for their dance and recreation that no man live that shall have come by chance and see the same without knowledge of these unlucky thing but will have confident suppose it have and must have be the handy work of man which some way confirm the opinion the Spaniard the spaniard opinion of they hold of they and do not stick to write it that they be absolute a race and kind of people who in regard they will not be bring to work and live under subjection refuse to speak and so he report of they and to conclude among their multitude of wild beast we have inquire among they especial when I be at the high in the country whether they can tell or report of a Vnycorne set forth unto they a beast with one only horn in his forehead and certain they have tell i that high within the land there be a beast which have one only horn in the same manner but describe the beast to be both about the colour and bigness of a vallow dear and the horn to the pleoples report of a unicorn be about the length of their arm and no otherwise which be nothing like to the description of a unicorn as he be with we set out if there be any such beast whereof indeed I be very doubtful and so I be come to the last which be to deliver what land foul and of that nature there do remain wild as we have see among they the discourse of land foul among such foul and bird that remain and live upon the land in our travel up the river and our daily walk and travel upon the shore our indraught be so many hundred mile we never see any ostrich neither do any of the country people ever bring any of their feather to barter or sell unto we so as it appear plain there be none of they in these part notwithstanding in the river of Senega which be to the northward and likewise again more southerly upon the sea coast of Africa great store therefore the great bird or fowl we see be call a stalker who by reason of his long leg and neck when he stand upright the stalker be in height tall than a man his body in substance be more than a indifferent lamb which we do feed upon and find it somewhat a dry meat but well allow for nourishment and by the country people much esteem of the especial desire we have to kill they be in regard of some feather he have which be take in due time and so preserve be here at home esteem and wear the next in greatness be call a wake in regard of the great noise he make when he fly the wake which resemble what he be call by and of these there be great abundance who for the most part live upon their rice ground and in those time do they great spoil they be very good to eat and be a bird of a great stature have the upper part of his head carry a beautiful show with a please tuft on his crown which I have see wear by great personage here at home there be infinite store of another sort of excellent bird which we call Guinea hen in bigness Guinea hen much about our pheasant and in beauty answerable his feather be all lay over he like unto eye in a please fashion they be all the country over and in flock of many hundred together their food be upon their corn ground keep close together insomuch as we have kill eight of they at one shoot they be a excellent meat and many of these be bring into England and give as present to those of note and worthy person who preserve and keep they for their rareness as bird of pleasure and in the very like abundance they have partridge who colour be not beautiful so much as our partridge here but only of a dark feather and these be likewise all the country over where it be plant for the most remain near their house and in the middle of their dwelling the great partridge plenty of both which kind of Gynney hen and partridge be some manifest token there be no fox at all in the country who be in these our part great enemy to both the kind of pheasant and Partridge and the cause the keep so near the house be to preserve they from as subtle enemy which be the babowne and monkey who be no night walker and in the day time the recourse of people make they keep further off whereas otherways they will not fail to be sharer there be also great store of quail who be in bigness quail as great as a woodcock and from whence it be derive I can avouch only it be say they be of those kind of quail as fell among the child of Israel tent thus much I can affirm they be a please and delightful meat and in many place where we have make abode they have accustom to shall about we so as provide wherewithal to shoot they man diet be mend even in a short warning in all their town and dwelling likewise store of pigeon which feed upon the pigeon offal of their corn in the very door yet all be wild and of tame pigeon they have no knowledge I have with my stone-bow or pelletbow in two hour kill twenty pigeon even among their house which manner of shoot they have have in wonderful admiration and these bird or foul nominate be such that be at all time and in most place ever near at hand and always ready for sustenance if man be provide and will take small pain to look they there be likewise in the country parats but none good for aught except the dun with the red tail of which fort you have some few that come to parrot speak well but of parakeet there be very many parakeet and beautiful bird which be often bring home and some few attain to perfection also of small bird great variety and sundry strange shape among variety of small bird which many be in colour delightful to the eye and many in note very please to the ear there be among the variety one small bird which for his strangeness we observe he have no leg but two string like the bird of Arabia with which he hang with his head downward and have such resemblance to a dead leaf as it hang on the tree be direct of that a small bird withoutlegge colour whereby unless he be see too light you can hardly discover he and he do seem to take pleasure to deceive man eyesight hang wondrous steady without motion while he be look after and very near the touch likewise another a bird with four wing about the bigness of a turtle dove strange bird there be which fly with four wing we see he not all the day but a hour before night his two foremost wing be large the other be a pretty distance backward and bear his body between four palpable as I speak of these bird it be very necessary I shall set down how nature teach these little creature to provide for the safety of themselves and the young they bring forth I have show before what troop and multitude of babowne and monkey the country be store withal which be profess enemy to feather fowl and therefore in these little poor creature who can make no resistance nature have direct they by art to prevent cruelty among the great variety of strange tree and wood which the country afford whereof there be not any that I can know or call by a english how the bird preserve their young from the baboon and munkye name by say this tree do grow in England there be especial one who do exceed in prickle both upon the body branch and arm even to the outermost small springge many of these grow distant from the water and many of they grow upon the bank side hang their top over the water we observe that of this only tree the little bird make choice and not content with his defence of prickle make use likewise of his grow over the water and on that side which bend to the river on the very outside do they wind their nest with a owse or neck which be hollow make of reed and sedge the whole nest hang like a bottle make fast by the neck in some place so thick together that the same side of the tree seem as it be all cover with thatch unto which if notwithstanding the prickle the babown or monkey dare approach the fear he shall have that the bough will not bear he and the fall he be in danger of together with the fright of the water underneath he be able to daunt he by which natural care he preserve his increase and speed better than many time the parrot do for he likewise be provident to make his nest on the outermost small twig of a tree but on the land wind it about the twig so near as it will not bear any of his unhappy enemy who notwithstanding be vigilant for their own end and by get upon upper bough will overlook his desire prey and when he see they be grow to fill up the nest will hazard chary as the bough may bear he and sit fast with his two hinder foot with his two hand take up the bough and shake it in that manner that either some the su^^^^ry of the babowne or all forth of the nest shall tumble and be down he gain they for his labour another kind of art nature have teach these bird in the high bank which be steep over the river who steepness hinder the access of these devourer they will make hole so artificial round like augor hole and of that equal distance the one by the other so thick another mean of preservation as the bank will bear carry they at least a yard within the ground by which place they preserve themselves and their young but there be bird of defence such as be hawk whereof there be one sort as large as our jerfauchon and these as the people tell we will of their own accord kill the wild dear by seize upon his head and hang fast do continue beat with his hawk that will kill a vallow dear wing until the dear faint and then he prey upon he and likewise of other sort that live upon prey who manner of breed be in the open tree and by the continual watch and attend the nest they be ready to defend and save their young there be no great eagle but of a kind of small bastard eagle infinite store and likewise several sort bastard eagle of raven kite and buzzard whereof the skin of one sort smell wondrous sweet and strong after the savour of the crocodile these sort be easy to be discern for if at any time we happen to kill a beast in the wood whereby any blood be discover although there be scarce any one of these raven bird to be see almost instant you shall have such troop of all sort come in as be able to devour the whole carcase if we be not present to affront they and the only mean the people have to find out either elephant or any other beast as they die or come to a untimely end among how the people find the dead beast the thick wood or high reed be by observe and keep watch to look out where these raven bird gather together which be easy discern the nature of they be to sore and fly in the air aloft over the place where their prey remain to which place the people repair and many time be sharer in the booty and to shut up this discourse that it may appear how likely it be these bird and fowl may well increase we do not see that the people have any ingenious conceit either by gin the inhabitant want knowledge to take they or otherwise to kill or take of they but upon any especial time when the king be determine to make a feast they observe a course to take they with the rehearsal whereof I will make a end the great command be send that all people come abroad and be in the field be set and place several of a in different distance the one unto the other when the Partridge and gynny hen be spring or put up as their nature be to fly but a indifferent flight so soon as he light again they eat ready to run in and put they up and in this manner still pursue the king man never of hawk they that they be weary out and the people with their hand take they up and bring they to the king even to that number as may content he with which their princely pastime I here conclude my story the conclusion and for a final end do earnest desire that what be write may be take into consideration thereby to stir up a more willing affection to prosecute and go on in a timely proceed upon this hopeful trade which will crave expedition in regard of these reason follow first there be as it be a certain combination make betwixt the people above and we never to fail they of a yearly trade which they in their part without all doubt will caresul expect and as they have faithful promise will according provide for and if in our part it shall be neglect may just cause they to take a great distrust of our fidelity which in regard we be now the first white people they have see and have from they receive such fair approbation may settle a distaste for the present very prejudicial and among such a barbarous people we know not whether it may be easy remove again the course we run be allowable by our law fit and agree with the peaceful time we live in opposite to no neighbourly love or amity neither confront any foreign prince by enter or intermeddle within any forbid territory neither be it do in any warlike or hostile manner but by the ancient and free commerce that unite nation the course of marchandize a commodious exchange answer to either side wherein a especial animation be the certain knowledge we have gain in discover the golden trade of the moor in Barbary which be the first incourager and beginning of this business and for which the adventure hitherto have be lay through the uncertainty whereof those loss and mischance that have happen fall out and therefore now shall with a more settle resolution be follow to regain by knowledge what ignorance miscarry in and I may join with this the familiar conversation fair acceptance and mutual amity we find the native to embrace we withal not only celare our own doubt which before knowledge must of necessity be but likewise disprove and altogether confound the report and speech of all those who to serve their own end give out the people above to be a bloody and dangerous nation again to advance the adventurer let the already know and certain trade be remember which in my own perfect knowledge I will make good against all maligner and secret opposer that in our staple and principal commodity it be not vent but at ten for one profit and admit the discovery shall not prove yet there will be find place of trade sufficient and that within the limit of fair recourse to vent and put of such a reasonable proportion as shall bring a return of that advantage as shall be able to bear the charge of a further search and likewise answer the expectation here at home of any reasonable mind adventurer provide they do arm themselves by knowledge of what those thing be which be vendible and likewise how to attain unto those place and order their occasion where those return be to be make whereunto be add that the expectation be not long in respect of other voyage when as the return be such that within the compass of ten month the whole voyage be to be perform both out and home allow the ship to be set forth from London and to to make their her return again moreover by the last discovery so many hundred mile up the river all which way be perfect know and from part to part observe and every reach in order by i set down and careful keep which may not only clear any doubt and difficulty in that already know way but likewise enable the judgement for pass further and especial order and give direction what boat or vessel be most apt and proper to follow the discovery withal as well for speedy passage as also for the most advantage to a more profitable return and further we may take into consideration how the time and season of the year be unto we discover that the turbulent and infectious season may be provide for and man advise the better to bear they and provide for themselves whereby as it shall please God to give a blessing those inconvenience may be avoid which former have be fall into and thing more necessary carry along which through ignorance heretofore have be neglect together with diverse other abuse that by experience no doubt may be amend and last in take leave of you the noble gentleman adventurer in this hopeful discovery let i under correction say unto you be not discourage let not the jangle disposition of any who your own wisdom lead you to see aim only to make up their own end this hearten you and if it please you examine the condition of what be past which if I mistake not may be this set down the first adventure be lose and miscarry through want of care and judgement of those seaman and merchant who have the manage by overmuch trust of suppose friend who shall at the very best have be no otherwise think and conceit of then suspicious enemy the vagrant Portugal who have now discover themselves which will ever stand for a warning to avoid the like and trust they any further and that be all you have for that money the second may somewaye be lay upon the seaman who understanding shall have avoid unseasonable time and especial discretion shall have lead they to have shun water in the very height of unseasonableness but it may be excuse for want of experience insomuch as there have never be any trial make so high in the river before to any effect to discover the unholsomnesse with the operation thereof whereby so many of they lose their life and bring again another loss upon you wherein the power of God be manifest by who only hand they fall and those few that return be send to testify what they have feel and fall into whereby you have gain a perpetual knowledge for obscrue seasonable time for your better proceed hereafter the valuation whereof be true understand may advance the employment which only remain in that loss to make you satisfaction and for this three and last wherein my eye have be a witness how account be bring in and perfect with you I be ignorant but I presume as bad as it be what with the return that be make and the remain bring home of the cargazon that be send you can be just deal withal receive any loss but for gain it be never intend towards you the whole business be carry by those you give credit and countenance unto with a absolute hand to abate and discourage your desire for wade further upon these adventure as by the manner thereof appear which I have already particular acquaint you withal and unnecessary to be remember here only this remain to make good what I in careful duty desire to lay open unto you from whence that first intent of give that blow of discouragement unto you do arise you have be since subject to diverse other encounter and all occasion be still earnest pursue to embrace that opportunity that will give leave or way to strike you and whereas they seek to discourage you yet by all public and secret mean can be devise they both have and do still address themselves to proceed and go on in the same adventure as you both know and have have just cause to except against and apparent it be that notwithstanding you in your generous disposition have sit down by the loss yet there be that have gain but allow if it please you all have be lose if you shall again consider what charge and expense have be lay forth and disburse in discovery of this nature nay in those of far less expectation with the recovery and satisfaction that afterward they have make even to this our native country whereof I forbear example in regard they be not hide from your true and ingenious knowledge only in regard of some great resemblance that may be to this intend business I may commend to your consideration the voyage into Muscouie wherein the merchant have that long passage of so many hundred league up a river and by a customary trade be bring to be hold as a ordinary passage the country be fit according by which use it be now no other way unto they than as we may term it here our western passage up the river of Thames wherein be more probability for the attain of this we aim at in regard our river be at all time open and not subject to cold nor those extreme frost which to the Muscovy trade be so great hinderer so that if you will conclude amongst yourselves of a sufficient stock and be arm with a bank the ground of merchandize to follow resolute your undertake enterprise for so much as to i belong I dare affirm you be upon the most promise occasion that ever in our little island be undertake most especial consider by how small a charge it may be perfect wherein as experience have make i the writer to acquaint you with each particular so likewise I ^^fe^ myself up both with my life and fortune ^a^^ with my utermost endeavour in your behalf by God especial blessing to bring to perfection what I have here relate which be leave with myself to your worthy consideration
