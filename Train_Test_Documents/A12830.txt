A GEOGRAPHICALL AND ANTHOLOgicall description of the whole World.

CHAP. I. DE GEOGRAPHIA.
1 GEographie is an Imitation of the picture Definition. of the whole earth, with those thinges which are annexed therevnto. Ptolm. Lib. 1. Cap. 1. Therefore it comprehendeth vnder it Chorographie, the description of a Region, Hydrographie, the discription of waters, Topographie, the description of a place, and the like.
2 The Subiect of Geographie, is this Terrestriall Subiect. Globe, composed of earth and water, so far forth as the parts of it, haue a diuerse scituation, as well in respect of the heauens, as one towards another. Maginus. pag. 3.
3 Concerning the Terrestriall Globe in respect of the Heauens, two things are dilligently to be obserued, Longitude and Latitude of places.
4 The Longitude of a place, is a distance intercepted betweene the first Meridian, which passeth Longitude. through the Canarie Ilands, and the Meridian of the
 place, which Longitude is alwayes to be measured from West vnto East in the degrees of the Aequator. The reason is, because all Meridia^s cut the Aequator.
5 The Latitude of a place, is a distance intercepted Latitude. betweene the Aequator, and any place North or South from it, which to finde out, turne the place in the Globe, vntill it come directly vnder the brazen Meridian, then numbring in the brazen Meridian, how many degrees be betwixt the Aequator and the place, it shewes the Latitude directly.
Therefore the Longitude and Latitude beeing knowne of a place, it is easie to finde it in any globe; and on the contrarie, if you see the place first in the globe, by turning it vnder the brazen meridian, both the Longitude and Latitude is knowne.
6 Concerning the Terrestriall Globe, in regard of his partes one vnto the other, it is diuided into Sea, and Land.
7 The Sea or Ocean, is a huge water compassing about this whole Vniuerse, whose partes passing by Sea. many particular places; are called by sundrie and particular names, as Mare Britanicum, a Britania, Mare Mediterraneum: quia mediu^inter duas terras, africae and Europae. Mare Atlanticum of the great mou^tain Atlas.
8 In the Sea, are to bee considered three things: Creekes, Straights, and Hauens.
9 A Creeke is a place where the Sea doth runne Sinus. any where into the bosome of the earth: And such are Sinus Arabicus, or the redde Sea: Sinus Persicus, or Mare Balserum, Sinus Adriaticus, or the Gulfe of Venice.
10 Fretum, is a narrowe straight, or Arme of the Sea, passing betwixt two Lands, so called a Fremitu. Fretum.
 Whereof the chiefe are, Fretum Gaditaneum, or the straights of Gibraltar, Fretum Magellanicum, or the straights of Magellane: Fretum Nassouicum, or the North Straights.
11 A Hauen is a litle Creeke or entrance into the Portes. maine Ocean, where shippes are alwayes rested and harbored.
12 The Earth, as may be seene in all Geographicall Earth. Maps and tables, is described and paynted forth with huge Mountaines, great Woods, faire Riuers, and many famous Cities: the circuit of it, is 21600. miles, and (as some write,) if a footman had a pathway round about the World, hee might goe it in 900. dayes. Magiuus.
13 In the Earth are to be considered and obserued, two things, the Ilands, and the Continent.
14 An Iland, (quasi, eye of land,) is compast round Iland. about with the Sea, as Britania, Hybernia, Sardinia, etc: Of the Latins it is called Insula, quasi in Salo.
15 A Continent is a great quantitie of land not diuided Continent. by waters, where many Kingdomes and Empires are lincked and ioyned together. As Spaine, France, Germany. etc.
16 In both Ilands and Continent, three things are to be noted: Istmus, Peninsula, and Promontorium.
17 An Istmus or Chersonesus is a narrow or straight Istmus. land between two Seas. Of which, the most famous are Istmus Corinthiacus, and Istmus Cymbricus, both in Europe.
18 Peninsula (quasi pene Insula) is a part of the continent, euery where inuironed with the Sea, vnlesse Peninsula. it be where it is tyed vnto the firme land, with a little
 Istmus. The most farre fam'de of which are, whole Africa, Scandia, Taurica Chersonesus, Pelloponesus or Morea, and Peruana in America.
19 A Promontorie, is a high Mountaine, which Promo^tory bendeth it selfe into the Sea, the extreame or end of which, is called a Cape. Of which, the most known are the Cape of good Hope, in Africa: the Cape of Saint Vincent, in Portugall: the Cape Comari in Asia: and the Cape de la Victoria, in America.


CHAP. II. Of the vnknowne parts of the Earth.
1 HEtherto haue I set downe the generall affections of the Terrestriall globe. Now therefore will I descend vnto particulars, and onely, and particularly speake of the earth, because Hydrographie doth rather belong vnto the art of Nauigation.
2 The partes of the Earth are either vnknowne, or knowne.
3 The vnknowne partes which lye in obscuritie, are eyther in the North vnder the Articke Pole, or in the South, vnder the Antarticke Pole.
4 The vnknowne Land which lyeth vnder the Artick Pole, is separated euery where (as it is thought) from the other partes of the World, with the North Sea, which breaking in by 19. Inletts, and 4. Staights,
 is supped vp, and ingulft into the bowells of the earth, vnder the blacke Rocke, which lyeth directly vnder the Pole, being in compasse 33. Leucars.
Iames Cnoyen in the booke of his trauells, maketh mention of a certaine Priest of Noruegia, which had by tradition from a Frier of Oxford, that by the help of his magicke, and taking the fittest opportunitie of time, hee vndertooke to trauell into those parts, and was directly vnder the Pole, where he descryed all these things. Mercator.
5 Not far distant from the blacke Rocke are scituated foure Ilands of reasonable bignesse, the Sea running betweene euerie one of them, and making them equall in quantitie one vnto the other. In one of the which Ilands beeing opposite vnto Biarmia, are found Pigmies or little men, not aboue 4. foote in height. Magin.
6 The vnknowne Land, which lyeth vnder the Antarticke Pole, is thought to be greater then all the earth besides.
7 In it are descried some fewe Prouinces, as Nona Guynea, Terra del Fuego Psittacorum Regio, Lucach, Reach, and Maletur. All which together, are called Magelane.
Of these Countryes nothing can be certainely spoken, only that in the land del Fuego there is much smoke, in Psittacorum regione, there are great Parrets, in Beach, Golde: in Maletur Spices.
8 The Inhabitants of these Regions which haue bene seene (beeing very fewe) goe naked, and are most barbarous people. Mercator.



CHAP. III. Of the knowne parts of the Earth.
THe vnknowne parts of the World haue beene obscurely spoken of. Now followeth the description of the knowne parts, which are soure in number, Europe, Asia, Africa, and America.

OF EVROPE.
1 EVrope (called by Plinie the fairest of all other Nations,) is on the South, separated (from Africa) Boundes. with the Straights of Gibraltar, and the Mediterr anean Sea, on the West (from America,) with the rowling waues of the Atlanticke Ocean, and on the East (from Asia,) with the Egaean Sea, Hellespont, Propontus, Thracius, Bospherus, Pontus Euxinus, Bospherus Cimirius, Maeotis Palus, Tanais fluuium, and so drawing vp a line vnto the riuer Duina, which runneth along vnto the Port of Saint Nicholas, disburdning it selfe into Sinus Granuicus, or the North Sea.
2 The forme of Europe is like vnto a Dragon, the Simititude head being Spaine, and the wings Denmarke and Italy.
3 In Longitude it is 3800. miles, reaching from Longitude the Cape of Saint Vincent in Portugal, vnto Constantinople in Thracia. Magin. Orteli.
4 In Latitude, it co^taineth 1200. miles, stretching Latitude. it selfe from the Archipelago or Egaean Sea, vnto Mare Congelatum, or the Frozen Ocean.

 5 The people or inhabitants of it, doth farre surpasse Inhabita^ts the residue of the other parts, in Religio^, Learning, Artes, valor and ciuilitie. And are all Christians, vnles it be towards the northeren part of Scandia, or those which are vnder the Tyrannicall gouernment of the Turke. Magin.
6. In Europe are to be considered two thinges: First, the Kingdomes and Empires which are contained within the Continent, and then the Ilands.
7 First therefore of the Continent, in which are Diuision. contained 16. Kingdomes, Spaine, France, Germanie, Belgia, Dania, Italie, Illyria, Hungarie, Polonia, Prussia, the Turkish Empire in Europe, Transiluania, Lituania, Liuonia, Scandia, Moscouia, or Russia.

OF SPAINE.
1 SPaine is in euery place enuironed with the Sea, Boundes. vnles it be towards the north-east part, where it is ioyned vnto France, distinguished only by the high Pyrinean mountains. It co^taines in circuit, 1890. miles.
2 This land is very fertill, enricht with all kindes Qualitie. of wine, Sugar, all sortes of fruites, graines, oyles, mettalls, especially of Golde and Siluer.
3 The inhabitants of it are verie ceremonious, superstitious, Inhabita^ts proude, hypocrites, laborious, addicted more then any other Nation vnto Melancholy, and descended of the Gothes, Saracens, and Iewes.
4 This kingdome is diuided into many Prouinces, whereof the chiefe are first, Portugal, famous for Prouinces. Nauigation, in which the chiefe citie is Lisbone: the second is Granado, or Andalucia, in which are the best horses: the chiefe citie in it is Siuill, from whence
 come our excellent ciuill Oranges: in this Prouince is also Cadiz or Cales, that was once surprised by Englishmen: the third Prouince is Casteile, in which is that great citie Tolledo, the Byshoprick wherof commeth neere in reuenues vnto the Popedome: the fourth is Nauarre, in which stands the city Bilbao, fro^ whence we haue so many excellent tride blades: the fift and last is Galicia, in which standeth S. Iago: where Saint Iames is much reuerenced. Ortel.
5 The chiefe riuers of these prouinces are foure, Riuers. Tagus, in which is found much golden Sande: Guadiana or Ana, which runneth into a Cauerne or hole of the earth, for a great space, and riseth vp againe. Guadalquiuir, vppon whose bancks stand Siuill. And the last is Duerus. Merula.
6 In times past this was diuided into 12. Kingdomes, Gouernement. but nowe it is onely one entire Gouernement, subiected vnto one King: who is called, King of Spaine.


OF FRANCE.
1 FRance is limited on the West, with Mare Aquitanicum, Boundes. and the Pyrinea^ Mountains: on the North, with the English Sea: on the South, with Mare Mediterraneum: on the East, with Germanie: and on the Southeast, with the Alpes. Magin.
2 This country is extraordinary fruitfull, abounding Qualitie. almost in euery thing, especially in Corne, Wine, and Salt, which causeth that saying, that France hath three Loadstones to draw riches from forraine Nations, Corne caried into Spaine, Wines tra^sported into England and Flanders, and Salte, wherewith the whole kingdom and bordering Nations are ple^tifully stored.

 3 The Inhabitants of this Land are in the first onset Inhabita^ts. of any thing very vehement, but at the length as slowe and dull. In their words only verball, in their deeds cautelous: from whence it is said; that the Frenchman sings not as hee prickes, pronounceth not as he writes, speakes not as hee thinkes.
4 The Prouinces of this Region are manie, among which, three of them haue free Princes. The first is Lorreine, Prouinces. in which the chiefe cittie is Nancie: the second is Burgundie, whose Metrapollitane and chiefe cittie is Bisancon, lying vpon the riuer Doux; the third is Subaudia, or Sauoye, whose chiefest citie is Geneua, scituated vpon a faire and pleasant Lake, and in which they haue a law, that if any offender flie for refuge thither, the law doth as wel take holde on him there, as in the place where hee committed the crime.
5 The other prouinces are many, among which the chief are eight. First, the Prouince of Normandie, whose Metrapolitane citie is Roan, famous for trafficke, in manie forraine countries: the second is Britanie, whose chiefe citie is Brest: the third is Burges or Berrie, whose chiefe citie is called Burges, which (as Iohn Calmenus affirmes) hath an Vniuersitie in it, worthy to be intituled: The Honour of all learning, and store house of learned men. The fourth is Aquitanie, in which stands Tolouse, that beautifull, best peopled, and most ancientest citie of France, next vnto Paris: the fift is Picardie, in which the chiefe citie is Amiens: the sixt is Poictou, in which is the citie Poictiers: the seuenth is Languedocke: and the eight is Aniou: Many others there are, which to rehearse, would be too tedious, and therefore I omit them.
6 The Riuers of note in these Prouinces, are foure. Riuers. The first is Sequana or Seine, which runneth through the
 fairest and Metrapolitane Citie of France, called Paris, or Lutetia, (quasi in luto sita.) The seco^d is Loyre, vpon whose shores stand Angiers and Orleance, two famous cities. The 3. is Rhodanus or Rhosne: the 4. and last of any note is Garo^ne
7 Two things are reported of this Countrey, very stra^ge. The one is, that the King cureth a certain wenne, Wonders. which riseth in a mans neck, with the touch of his hand, saying these words: Sanet te Deus, tangit te Rex. The other is, that ther is a certain oyle in the church of Rheims, which as they report, was sent from Heauen: and the Kings being annointed with it euery Coronation day, it doth neuer decrease. Hondius in Tabulis.
8 This Kindome is gouerned by a Monarchicall gouernement, subiected vnto one sole King, who is called Gouernment the king of France, and his eldest sonne is tituled the Dolphine of France. From this countrie is excluded by the Salick lawe, any woman, that shee cannot raigne and be Queene.


OF GERMANIE.
1 GErmany, is distinguished on the west from France, by Boundes. part of the riuer Rheine, and a line, which is drawen vp directly fro^ Strasburg vnto Cales: on the South, from Italie, with the Alpes: on the South-east, with Istria, and Illyrica: and on the East with Hungarie, Polonia, and the riuer Vistula. Magin.
2 This countrie is inricht with all sortes of Mines, as Qualitie. well of Salt, as of Mettalls. It hath also great abundance of corne, wine, saffron, fruits, hote bathes, and sweete fountaines.
3 The Inhabitants of this Empire are generallie very tall, goodly, warlike, and faithfull men, little addicted vnto Inhabitants. venerie, but much affecting drunke^nes, that welspring of Impietie, from whence bubbleth out this saying of them, that Germanus potat quantum potest: and Germanorum
 viuere, est bibere. They are also for their inuentions in Inuentions. arts Mechanicall most excellent, and farre surpassing anie other Nation: for from them came the inuention of Gunnes, inuented of one Bertholdus Swart, in the yeare 1378. by them was also inuented Printing, in the yeare of our Lord, 1440. by one Ihon Gutemberg, but (as Ramus affirmes,) by one Iohn Fust, who printed Tullies Offices, which was the first booke that euer was printed.
4 In the middle of Germany is scituated Bohemia, a very Bohemia. pleasant kingdom, compast about with a wood called Sylua Hyrcinia: the chiefe citie of it is Prage, in which the Emperour doth keepe his Court.
5 There are also in this great and large Dominion many Prouinces. Prouinces, among which, the especiall, first Saxonie, whose Metrapolitane citie is Witteberg, lying vppon the Riuer Albis: the second is Brande^bourg: in which stands Franckford, scituated vppon the Riuer Odera: in which there is an Vniuersitie, erected by Marques Ioachim, in the yeare, 1506. The third is Pomerania, the chiefe Citie of which is Stetim. The fourth is Bauaria, whose best cittie is Munchen. The fift is Slesia, in which is scituated the city Bressel. The sixt is Franconia, whose most noted Citie is Franckford, founded vppon the riuer Moenum, in which Martes. place is alwayes the Election of the Emperour, and the famous Martes for bookes. The seuenth is Austria, the Metrapolitan of which, is that famous Vienna, seated vpon the riuer Danubius, esteemed to be one one of the fairest Citties in Germanie. The eight and last, worthy to Heluetia. be preferred before all the rest, is Switzerland or Heluetia, which is diuided into 13. Cantones or chiefe cities with their Apendices, the gouernment of them beeing onely popular: for although the members seeme to be separated, yet liue they as one bodie, firmly knit and vnited, euerie
 one hauing his particular Magistrate and Councell.
6 The most famous Riuers of these Prouinces are sixe. First is the great Danubius, which doth receiue into Riuers. it 60. Nauigable Riuers, before it is disburdened into Pontus Euxinus: the second is Rhene, from whence commeth the best Rhenish wine, and vpon whose banke is scituated the citie Strasburge or Argentine, in which ther is a towre of 578. Geometricall paces high, counted the eight Miracle of the world: the third is Amasus: the fourth is Moenus: the fift is Odera: and the sixt is Albis.
7 The Emperours do not succeed, but are alwaies chosen by these 6. Electors: the Arch-byshops of Ments, Triers, and Colen: the Countie Palatine of Rhene: the Duke of Saxonie, and the Marquesse of Brandeburge. If these ca^not agree, then doth the King of Bohemia decide the controuersie.
8 Concerning the Gouernment of this Empire, it hath manie free Princes, which is the reason that the Emperour by some is called a King of Kings. Gouernment


OF BELGIA.
1 BElgia, (or the Lowe Countreyes,) is limited on the Boundes. East, with Germanie: on the South, with France: on the West, with the mayne Ocean: and on the North, with Denmarke and part of the great Sea. It contayneth in circuit 1000. Italian miles.
2 This Countrie doeth most excell in all manner of Linnen, and fine Stuffes: and about Frisea, Gelderland, Qualitie. and Holland, they haue Oxen of such an incredible bignesse, which if they were ballanced, would weigh aboue 2000. poundes, for there was seene in Antwerpe, a Bull, whose bodie did exceede 3200. weight. Magin. Ortel. In this Countrie there is also great abundance of Butter, Cheese, Herring, and Salmon, and especially in Holland.

 3 The Inhabita^ts are very goodly and propermen, hauing Inhabitants. generally well proportionated legs. They are great drinkers, not proud nor enuious, but vnmindfull both of benefits done vnto them, and of iniuries offered. They are excellent Musitians, and in Mechanicall arts most expert. Prouinces.
4 The prouinces of Belgia are 17. in which are co^tained 4. Dukedomes, 7. Earldomes, 5. Barondries, and 1. Marqueship.
5 The 4. Dukedomes are first, Brabant, in which the 1. Brabant. chiefe citie is Antwerp, fortified with 10. royall Bulwarks, and hauing within it a Towne-house, whose circuite is 4812. paces. There is also in this Prouince an Vniuersitie called Louaine. Ortel.
6 The second Dukedom is Liege or Luicke, called by 2. Liege. some the Paradise of Priests: the chiefe city is Liege, from whence the Dukedome taketh his name.
7 The third is Lutzenburge, in which is the great Forest 3. Lutzenburge. of Ardenna, which was in the time of Caesar 500. miles in le^gth, at this day only 90. the chief city is Lutze^burg. or.
8 The 4. and last Dukedome is Gelderland, noted 4. Gelderla^d. chiefly for the excellent pasture groundes, which are in it, the chiefe citie is Nimmegen. Ortel.
9 The 7. Earledoms or Counties, are first Flanders, in 1. Flandres. which the chiefe city is Gaunt, there are also many strong Port towns in it, as Newport, Du^kerk, Ostend, and Slewis. Ort.
10 The second is Artois, the chiefe citie of which is 2. Artois. Arras, from whence commeth the best cloth of Arras.
11 The third is Hainolt, whose fairest city is Mons, in which there is a Capitall of Religious women, that was 3. Hainolt. erected by Vadruda, Dutches of Lorraine.
12 The 4. is Holland, very poore of it self, vnles it be in pasture grounds, in which they nourish so many Cattell 4. Holland. that it doth excell other parts in Butter and cheese. They are also so strong at Sea, that they are able to make 800.
 great ships, and twice so many small. The chiefe citie is Amsterdam, so famous for Trafficke, that there may be seen in her Port somtimes, 500. great ships at once. Ortel.
13 The fift is Zealand (quasi Sea and Land,) in which 5. Zealand. countrie or Countie there is found no fresh water. In it is also very little wood. The chiefe citie is Middelborough, in the Iland of Walcheren.
14 The sixt is Zutphen, of which very little or nothing 6. Zutphen. can be spoken.
15 The 7. and last Countie is Namur, verie plentifull 7. Namur. of Woods and Deare, the chiefe citie is Namur.

17 The seco^d is Vltrect, whose chiefest city is Vtreck.
17 The third is Mechlin: the fourth is Ouerissel: the fift and last Lordship is Groining.
18 The 17. Prouince is, the Marquiset of the holie Empire, in which nothing is famous.
19 The most noted Riuers of these Prouinces are three, the first of which is Rhene, mentioned before in Riuers. Germanie: the next it Schald, which washeth the bancks of Antwerpe: the last is Meuse, vpon whose shore is scituated Luicke.
20 This Country (famous for wars) is in part gouerned Gouernme^t. by manie, whom they call States of the lowe Countries. But the Arche-duke of Austria wageth warre continuallie with them, to bring it vnder his Dominion, claiming and laying Title vnto it.


OF DENMARKE.
DEnmarke is enuironed round with the maine Ocean, Limites. vnlesse it be on the South, where it is ioyned vnto Germanie.

 2 This Kingdome doth abound in goodly Horses, Qualitie. and in such store of cattell, that there are yearely carried into Germanie 50000. Oxen. There is also such infinite abundance of herring, (neare vnto the Ile Scania) that the ships are scarce able by maine strength of Owers to rowe out of the Harbour, the fish lying so thicke, that their quantitie is supposed to surpasse the water it selfe. Ortel. Inhabita^ts.
3 The Inhabita^ts of this country are very valia^t both at land and Sea, in their Religion they are all Lutherans.
4 The Prouinces of this Kingdome are almost all Prouinces. Ilands, amo^g which, the chiefe are first, Sealand, in which is Coppenhagen, the chiefe seate of the King, and an Vniuersitie, in it is also Roschilt, where the Kings are still intoombed. The second is Loilant, in which there growe so many Hazell-nuts, that shippes are loaded there with them. The third is Fimera, in which Ticho Brahe built a Castle by Arte, to the wonder of euery body that hath euer seene it. In the Continent are containd two other Prouinces, Iugtland, and Holsten, in which is Meldrope, the inhabitants of which are so riche, that they couer their houses with copper. Magin.
5 In this Countrie is also a straight Sea, passing betweene some of the Ilands, called the Sound: which by Sound. reason of the Imposts and Customs of the Ships which passe that way, yeeldeth great gaine and profite vnto the King.
6 The Gouernment of this Kingdome is vnder one Gouernme^t. sole Prince, who is called the King of Denmarke.


OF ITALIE.
ITalie, (called by Merula a Terrestriall Paradice: The Boundes. Phoenix of this Massie round, the earths riche Ornament, the Garden of the Muses,) is garded on the East,
 with the Adriaticke Seas on the South, with Mare Mediterraneum: on the West, with the Terrhene or Ocean: and on the North, with the Alpes, which separateth it from Germanie, it is like vnto a mans legge, reaching in length from Augusta Pretoria, vnto Otranto, which is 1010. miles, and is in breadth, in the brodest place, 420. miles.
2 To set downe the fruitfulnes of this riche Region, it may be as well declared in a line as in a leafe, for there Qualitie. is of all things such plentie, as there is not of any thing any scarcitie.
3 The people of this Nation are verie graue, frugall, wittie, excelling both in vertue and vices, which are in Inhabitants. lust, monstrous: in hate, implacable: and in their conuersation most deceitfull: which had rather bestowe any thing vpon others, then vpon themselues: do more oftener blaspheme then sweare. And will rather kill a man, then giue him a disgracefull tearme or word.
4 This Kingdome is diuided into many Prouinces, whereof the chiefe and most famous are fiue. Prouinces.
5 The first is the Kingdome of Naples, which is greater then any of the rest, full of Nobilitie, and abounding Naples. with all things necessary for mans vse. The chiefe citie of it is Naples, lying vpon the Terrhenean Sea.
6 The second is the Romane Territorie, a Prouince richly furnished with all prouisions, in which is scituated Roma. the Cittie of Rome, once called the Empresse of the world, as well for the beautie and Magnificence of the Citie, as for the Learning and fortitude of the Citizens: but now it is much ruinated: true Religion and vertue cleane decayed. The Gouernour of it beeing the Pope, that proud prelate, persecutor of all true pietie, and zealous professours.
7 The third Prouince is Lumbardie, comprehending Lumbardie.
 vnder it is the Dukedom of Millaine, which doth excell for beautie all the rest, hauing in it many faire Riuers and pleasant Lakes: the chiefe Citie of which, is Millaine: whose buildings are to be admired for their extraordinarie sumptuousnes. In this Prouince is also the great Lake de Como, which is 60. miles in le^gth, and vpon whose bankes stands the citie Como, in fashion like vnto a Crab, whose two feete couet the water. In this Citie the two Plinies had their beginning, whose Fame by reason of their great learning, shall neuer haue ending. Ortelius.
8 The fourth Prouince is Tuscanie, little inferior vnto Tuscanie. the rest in any thing, the chiefe Citie of which is Florence, whose inhabitants (since the time of Macheuill, which was their Recorder,) are most politicke and subtill, amounting vnto the number of 80. thousand persons.
9 The fift and last, is the Signorie of Venice, a free Venice. State, and the most famous of any in Christendome, gouerned by a Prince of great Maiestie: yet both hee and his authorite subiected vnto the Lawes.
This Citie with the Apendices vnto it, is the richest and best prouided with munition, of any Citie in Italie, as is confest in this particular ce^sure of each Prouince, before spoken: that Naples excells for Nobilite: Rome for Clergie: Millaine for beautie, Florence for policie: but Venice for riches.
10 There is is another prouince (somewhat famous) called Verona, in which is the mountaine Baldo, where all professors of Phisicke doe resort, to gather diuerse sortes of pretious Hearbes. And in which there is a citie called Negarino, wherin is a stone in forme like vnto a womans dugge, which doth continually distill a water, whose vertuous operation causeth a womans Milke to returne into her brests when she hath lost it.

 11 The chiefest riuers of these prouinces, are first Padus, neer vnto which stands Patauine that noble Vniuersitie: Riuers. the next is Athesis, adioyning vnto which is Trent, where a Councell was helde vnder Paul the third, in the yeare 1546. the next is Tiber, that runneth through the Citie of Rome, which when it doth ouerflowe the banks, doth betoken some ill fortune which shall befall the Citie: the last is the riuer Poe, neere vnto which stands Cremona, a Citie of great note.
12 In this Italie, which was in time past, one intier Gouernement, Gouernment are nowe many absolute States, and Princedomes, by the great Pollicie of the Pope, who thought it the best way to make himselfe great, by weakening the Empire.


OF ILLIRIA.
ILliria is limited on the West, with the Adriaticke Sea: on the North, with the riuer Sauus: and on the East, with Limits. the riuer Drinus. No certaine limits can be giuen of this countrie: For all Geographers that write, doe disagree about it.
2 The people of this land as (Liuie affirmes,) are verie Inhabitants. proude and outragious.
3 The chiefe Prouinces are three, whereof the first is Prouinces. Zara or Sebenine, whose chiefest citie is Zara, where (as Cornelius Sheppers doth report) is a Church called S. Iohn de Maluatia, which was built by a companie of Mariners that were in a dangerous tempest, and made a vowe that if they escaped, they would build a church vnto the honour of S. Ihon de Maluatia, whose morter should be tempered with Malmesie.
4 The next prouince is Dalmatia, in which the chiefe citie is Ragusus or Epidaura, where S. Ierosme was borne.

 5 The third and last is Histria, which is vnder the Venetians. Many other Prouines there are, whereof some Gouernment are subiect vnto the Turke, others vnder the Dominion of Hungarie.

2 This countrey hath in it great plenty of Dates, and Qualitie. the ayre is so holesome, that it admitteth neither Poxe nor Plague in it, but cureth any one that hath it.
3 The inhabitants are oftentimes blinded, by reason Inhabitants. of the vnreasonable store of sand which is there, much of it being carried and blowed with the winde. They are also much addicted vnto Poetry.

First is the Riuer Niger, which with a great invndation encreasing from the 15. of Iune, vntill 40. daies after, doth ouerflow a great part of the land: and in the like time it doth decrease againe. The next is the kingdome of Canaga, wherein the King hath no certaine reuenewes, but onely what his Nobles giue him. The next is Tombutum, where the king doth entertain a great company of learned men, and where inhabitants doe spend their time in dauncing and singing.

CHAP. VI.

Of the chiefe Ilands in Africa.
THus much of the continent of Africa: now will I knit vnto it the description of the Ilands.
1 The Ilands of Africa are diuided into Diuision. two parts: into those which are in the Atlanticke Sea, and into those which are in the Aethiopicke Ocean.
2 Those Ilands which are in the Atlantick Sea of note, are onely the Canarie Ilands, the Gorgades, and the Iland of S. Thomas.
3 The Canarie, or Fortunate Ilands, are 7. of which the Canarie. chiefe is Madera, wherein there is great store of Suger, and Canary Wine. There is another, which is called Tanariffa, wherein is a mountaine so high, that the inhabitants haue all their fresh water from a cloude that droppeth there very fast, hanging about a tree.
4 The Gorgades are nine, all which are full of Goates, Gorgades. and subiect vnto the King of Spaine.
5 The Iland of Saint Thomas, lyeth directly vnder the Aequator, it is very plentifull of Suger, and a place vnto which the Portugals do much resort.

CHAP. VII.

Of Asia.
HItherto haue I scorcht my selfe in the heate of Africa, now therefore of the temperate Continent of Asia.
1 Asia is in euery place begirt with the Sea, vnlesse it be towards the Westerne Limits. parts, where it is limited from Europe with the Riuer Tanais, and a line directly drawne vp vnto the Port of Saint Nicholas. And from Africa with that Istmus, betwixt the Arabick Gulfe, and the Mediterranean Sea.
2 This part of the world is farre more famous then any other: For here was the place where the Monarkes of the Medes, Persians, Babilonians, and Assirians flourished. Here was the place in which all the actes and monuments of the olde Testament, and almost in the new, were accomplished. And here was, and is, the place where the Myracles of our Sauiour were done, for euer to be celebrated.
3 The fruitfulnesse of this great Continent is very Qualitie. much, for it doth containe within it, almost plentie of euery thing.
4 The inhabitants of it, are generally very wittie, for Inhabitants. from hence sprang all the Sciences which the Greekes haue learned of the Hebrewes.

 5 The chiefe Riuers of Asia, are Iaxartes, Euphrates, Tigris, Riuers Indus, and Ganges.
6 Two other things there are in this part worthy to be noted: First, is the Mountaine Taurus, which diuides whole Asia into two parts, being in length 5625. miles, and in breadth 375. Next, is Mare Caspium, a Sea which hath no entercourse with any part of the Ocean.
7 This Asia is diuided into sixe great Gouernements, Diuision. into that of Moscouia in Asia, which I haue before described: Into Turcia Asiana, Tartarie, Persia, India, and China.

OF TVRCIA ASIANA.
1 VNder the Turkes Empire in Asia, are comprehended Diuision. Natolia, or Asia minor: Turcomania, Syria, or Palestina: and Arabia.


OF NATOLIA.
2 NAtolia, or Asia minor, is limited on the West with Limits. the Archipelago, on the South with the Mediterranean Sea, on the East with the Riuer Euphrates, and on the North with Pontus Euxinus.
3 This Countrey is very fruitfull and temperat, but Qualitie. by reason of the Turkes tyranny, it lyeth very waste, and not inhabited. For in it may be seene the ruines of 4000. Townes and Cities.
4 The inhabitants are most idle, lazy, and in religion Inhabitants. Mahumetans. Once they were all Christians, for with them were the seuen churches, which S. Iohn in his Apochalips did write vnto.
5 The chiefe Prouinces of Natolia are 8, Pontus, and Bithinia: Asia propria, or Sarrum: Licia, Pamphilia, Galatia, Prouinces. Cappadocia, and Cylicia.
6 In Pontus and Bithinia, there are two famous cities, Pontus and Bithinia.
 the one called Nice, where the first generall Councell was held: the other Chalcedo^, where the fourth was held. These Prouinces were once gouerned by Mithridates, who was the first finder out of Metridate.
7 In Asia Propria, or Sarcum, there are many things Asia propria worthy the obseruation: as first, Phrigia maior, of which Midas was King: next Phrigia minor, wherein are to be seene the ruines of olde Troy, and in which stands Pergamus, where Gallen, that famous Physitian was borne. In this country also liued Gordius, who knit the knot, which for the intricatenesse therof was called Nodus Gordianus. The next is Lidia, in which liued rich King Craessus. The next is Ionia, wherein stands that famous citie Ephesus, most renowned for the great Temple of Diana, which was in it, accounted to bee one of the wonders of the world. This is also one of the seuen Cities which Saint Iohn in the Reuelation wrote vnto, and vnto which Saint Paule did direct one of his Epistles. In this Prouince is also Smirna, an other of the seuen Cities, and in which Policarpus (that was Bishoppe there) liued, who sometimes had beene Scholler vnto Saint Iohn the Euangelist. The next, is Halicarnassus, wherein Dionisius and Heroditus, those famous Historiographers liued. The last of any fame, is the riuer Meandrus, which hath 600. turnings.
8 In Licia little is to be noted, onely that there stand Licia. some ruines of the Temple of Apollo, and that S. Nicholas liued there.
9 In Pamphilia stands the Citie of Seleucia, built Pamphilia. by Seleucus, one of the foure great successours of Alexander.
10 In Galatia were the people vnto whome Saint Galatia. Paule writ one of his Epistles: And this also is one of
 the Prouinces, where the Iewes were dispersed.
11 In Capadocia is that flourishing Citie of Trepizond, Capadocia. which in times past was a Citie Imperiall.
12 In Cilicia is the Citie Tarsus, where S. Paule was Cilicia. borne, and vnto which Ionas fled, when hee was commanded to goe vnto Niniuie.
13 The last Prouince is Armenia minor, in which there Armenia the lesse. is great store of Oyle, and excellent Wine.


OF TVRCOMANIA.
14 TVrcomania, or Armenia maior, is bounded on the Limites. West with the Riuer Euphrates, and Pontus Euxinus, on the South with Mesopotamia, on the East with Media, and Mare Caspium, and on the North with part of Tartaria.
15 The inhabitants of this Region, are great robbers, Inhabitants liuing after the manner of the basest sort of Tartars, that is, vnder tents, going from one place vnto another in companies.
16 The chiefe Prouinces are two, the first is Georgia, Prouinces. seated on the bankes of the Caspian Sea, wherein the inhabitants do chiefly worship Saint George: The other is Colchus, from whence Iason did setch the Golden Fleece.
17 In this Turcomania, the thing which is most famous, is, that the Arke of Noe did first rest it selfe vpon the Mountaines of Armenia, now called Nohae montes.


Of Syria, or Palestina.
18 SYria, Palestine, or the Holy land, is limited on the Limits. West with Mare Mediterraneum: on the South
 with Arabia, on the East with Mesopotamia, and on the North with the mountaine Libanus. This countrey is in compasse 200. miles.
19 The inhabitants of it were once so many, that it did Inhabitants. containe in it 30. Kings: and when Dauid did command the people to be numbred, there were found 1300000. fighting men. But at this time there are very few, and those Christians of euery sect, and Saracens.
20 The fruitfulnesse of this Kingdome doth chiefly Qualitie. consist of Wines, whose Grapes do grow in such aboundance, that they are gathered thrice in a yeare: They haue also great store of Apples, and Lemons.
21 The Prouinces which this Region is diuided into, Prouinces. are foure, Gallilie, Samaria, Iudaea, and Idumea.
22 Gallily is diuided into the higher and lower. In the Gallilie. higher is Phinicia, vnder which is comprehended Tire and Sidon. In the lower is Nazareth, where Christ was borne: and in it is also the Mountaine Tabor, where our Sauiour was transfigured.
23 In the Prouince of Samaria, stood that great city of Samaria. Samaria, the ruines of which are yet to be seene: and not farre from thence the citie Sichar, where Christ desired water of a certaine woman.
24 In the Prouince of Iudaea stood the once famous Iudaea. Citie of the world, called Ierusalem, where the Sepulchre of Christ is to be seene: and not farre from thence stood Bethlaem, where he was borne. There is also in this Prouince, an hearbe called Bachara, whose colour is like vnto a flame, and in the euening shineth like vnto a Sunne-beame, which if any one come to plucke it vp, it wil wag from him, vntill the vrine of a woman bee sprinkled on it. Iosephus de Bello Iudaico, Lib. 7.
25 The chiefe Riuers and Lakes of these Prouinces, Riue
 are foure. The first is Iordan, which springeth out of the Mountaine Libanus, so called of Ior and Dan, two riuers which meete together. The second is the Lake of Gallilie. The third is the Lake of Genazareth, or Tiberia, famous for our Sauiours sailing in it. The fourth and last, is Mare Mortuum, or the Dead Sea, into which Iordan is disburdened. At the top of this Lake swimmeth Pitch and Brimstone, from whence reaketh such a stinking mist, that it killeth all the birds that flye ouer it, and maketh the Apples that grow by it, being faire in shew, very rotten. Moreouer, the water is of that nature, that if an Oxe were throwne in with his feete bound, hee will not sinke. Iosephus Solinus, 48. Chap.


OF ARABIA.
26 ARabia is encompast on the West with the Red Sea, Limites. on the South with the maine Ocean, on the East with Sinus Persicus, and on the North with Syria, and Mesopotamia.
27 It is diuided into three parts, into Arabia Deserta, Diuision. Petrosa, and Foelix.
28 In Arabia Deserta nothing is worth the obseruing, but that it was the place where God did keepe the children of Israell for the space of 40. yeares, feeding them with Manna from heauen.
29 Of Arabia Petrosa, little can be spoken, onely that there stands the Mountaine Sinay, where God gaue the Tables of the Law vnto Moses.
30 Arabia Foelix, is one of the most fruitfullest Countries in the world, hauing in it Franchincense, mirrhe, and most pretious Balmes, which are in no other places to be found.
31 The chiefe Citie is Mediua, where Mahumet was
 intombed in an yron Coffin, which being carried into a Temple, the roofe whereof was made of Adamant, is attracted vnto the toppe of the Vault, and there hangeth, being supported by nothing.
32 The inhabitants of this Region, are superstitious, Inhabitants and in all their doings very vnconstant. They are in their Religion Mahometans. And as we reckon our time fro^ the yeare of our Lord, so they from the time of Mahomet, whose comming they haue long expected: saying, there were three great Prophets, Moses, Christ, and Mahomet. And as the Doctrine of Moses was bettered by Christ, so was the Doctrine of Christ mended by Mahomet.
Thus much concerning the Turkes Dominions in Asia.


OF TARTARIA.
1 TArtarie is limited on the North with the Scithian Limites. Sea, on the East with the East Ocean, on the South with the Indies, and the Wall of China, and on the West with Moscouia, and Sarmatia.
2 The inhabitants of this Countrey are of a meane Inuentions. stature, large in the shoulders, broad in the face, hauing flat Noses, and long Beardes. They marrie as many wiues as they will, liuing abroad in Tents made of the skinnes of Beastes: thinking it a great vnhappinesse, if they remaine in one place longer then the pastures haue meate for their Cattell. They eate the raw flesh of Horses, onely a little scorcht in the Sunne, not respecting how they were killed, or what diseases they died of. When they thirst, they let their Horses blood, and then sucke till they bee satisfied. They cannot abide Hogges flesh. And for their Religion,
 they are both Pagans and Saracens.
3 The chiefe Prouinces of Tartarie are fiue, Tartaria Prouinces. minor, Tartaria Asiatica, Tartaria Antiqua, Zagathay, or Scithia intra Imaum montem, Cathaia, or Scithia extra Imaum montem.

9 This part of Tartarie or Carthayo extra Imaum montem, Gouernment is gouerned onely by one, who is called the Great Cham, whose word stands for a lawe, and is titled of his subiects, Filius Dei, Vmbra Dei, and Anima Dei.


OF PERSIA.
1 PErsia is limited on the West with Sinus Persicus, on Limits. the North with Mare Caspium, and the riuer Oxus, on the South with the maine Ocean, and on the East with Indus Fluius.
2 This mightie Region hath in it great store of mettals Qualitie. and pretious stones, as much flourishing in faire Riuers and Lakes, as poore in fruits, hauing no trees but onely Palmes.
3 The inhabitants of this Kingdome are very courteous, Inhabitants. affecting hospitalitie, addicted much vnto Poetry and Physicke, and among whom Nobilitie is highly esteemed. They are of Religion for the most part Mahumetans, Religion. but such as the Turkes call Scismatickes.

4 India is diuided into two parts, India infra Gangem, and India extra Gangem.



De India within Ganges.
5 INdia intra Gangem, is inuironed on the West with the Limits. riuer Indus, on the South with the maine Ocean, on East with Sinus Bengala, and the Riuer Ganges, and on the North with part of the Mountaine Taurus.
6 This part is diuided into fortie seuen Kingdoms, Prouinces. among which there are onely fiue of any note, Cambaia, Decan, Malabar, Narsinga, and Delly.
7 In the Kingdome of Cambaia, the people are so Cambaia. ceremonious and superstitious, that they will not eate any thing that hath had life in it. They are great Idolaters, liuing in due obseruance of their King, who is a most valiant Prince. The chiefe Citie is Cambaia, wherein if any one dye, they presently burne his body, that it may dissolue into his proper elements. Hondius in tabulis.
8 Decan is a Kingdome made famous by the Portugalls, Decan. which lye continually in the great Citie of Goa. Not farre from this citie is a place, which if the hornes of any Beast bee cast, they will take roote and grow vp out of the ground. Hugo a Linschotten in cap. 61. of the description of the Indies.
9 In Malabar stands the Citie Calicute, the inhabitants Malabar. of which doe worshippe the Diuell: the King of it is titled by his subiects Samori, which signifieth God on earth. They are very skilfull Souldiours, vsing when they goe vnto Warre, to tye vnto the hilts of their Swordes Shingles of Copper, or Siluer, the sound whereof in steed of Trumpets and Drummes, encourageth them vnto fight. By the lawe of their Countrey they may not marry, but are allowed women in common.

 10 Narsinga, is a land fruitfull in euery thing, vnlesse Narsinga. it bee Horses. The chiefe Citie in it is Bisnagar, in which the people when they dye are burned: and if they were marryed, their wiues doe come and leape into the fire, willing to dye with them.
11 The last is the Kingdome of Delly; in which the Delly. chiefe and Metropolitane Citie is Delly, where the great Mogor doth alwayes keepe his Court.
12 The gouernment of all these Kingdomes are vnder Gouernment the great Mogor, vnlesse it be Narsinga, and Calicute, which haue free Princes.


Of India without Ganges.
13 INdia extra Gangem, is limited on the West with Sinus Limits. Bengala, and the Riuer Ganges, on the South with the maine Sea, on the East with part of China, and the East Sea, and on the North with part of the Mountaine Taurus.
14 The chiefe Prouinces of this part of the Indies are Prouinces. three, Pegu, Siam, and Chauchin china.
15 In Pegu there are most beautifull Parrats, and great Pegu. store of ciuet Cats. The chiefe city is Pegu.
16 In Siam there are many Schooles, the inhabitants Siam. whereof are great Idolaters, worshipping the higher Elements: And when any one dyeth with them, they will not bury them in the earth, but hang them vp in the aire, rather wishing the Birdes which are heauenly, to eate them, then the worms which are earthly to touch them. In this Prouince is also Comboia, the people of which do thinke themselues and all other men to bee of the same nature that brute beasts are. Hondius.

 17 In Chauchinchina, there is great store of gold, siluer, and Purceline, of which the Purceline dishes are made. Chauchinchina. The inhabitants in many places of this countrey, are Anthropophagi, or men eaters.

2 This Kingdome is not onely held to bee the chiefe of all Asia, but of al the world, being so fertil, that it doth Qualitie. both yeeld what is fitting for humane life, and whatsoeuer the delicate and effeminate appetite of man may lust after.
3 The inhabitants of it are very witty, politicke, great Inhabitants. Mathematicians, conceiuing so well of themselues, that they are accustomed to say, that themselues haue two eies, the people of Europe one, and the residue of the other Nations none.
4 Vnder this great kingdome are comprehended 15. Prouinces, the least of which exceeds in largenesse the greatest in Europe, and in them are contained 70. Kinges, which are all subiect vnto the King of China. The inhabitants are so many also, that they exceede the number of 70000000. And the cities and townes stand so thicke, that the whole kingdome seemeth as one mighty citie.

 5 The chiefe thinges which are to bee obserued, in these Prouinces, are first, that there are some of the inhabitants which dwell in houses vpon the Sea, buying, selling, and keeping market as they doe in any towne. And in many plaines they haue houses running vpon wheels, with sayles at the top of them, that when they will go vnto any place, they tarry onely for a winde to driue them. There is also in this Kingdome the great City of Quinzay, whose circuit is 100. miles, hauing in it 1600000. inhabitants, and 12000. stone bridges, among which there are some so high, that a great Shippe with top-saile may passe vnder them. In the middle of this Citie, there is a Lake thirtie miles in compasse, in which there are two goodly Ilands. Some put this Citie in Tartarie, some in China, others in the confines of both: but wheresoeuer it is, it is much ruinated since the time of Paulus Venetius, who maketh a full description of it.
6 This great kingdome is gouerned by one sole king, Gouernment who is called of his subiects the Lord of the world, and the sonne of the shining Sunne.




CHAP. VIII.

Of the Ilands in Asia.

3 The Iland Rodes is very famous for many things, Rodes. but chiefly for three: The first is, that the Sunne was neuer so maskt with a cloud, but that once in a day shee did shine vpon this Iland. The second is, that the great piller of the Sunne offered by the Gentiles vnto Iupiter, stood in this Ile, made in the forme of a mighty huge man. The third and last is, that the order of the Knights of the Rodes was held in this place.
13 The Iland Cyprus is very fuitfull, but little famous. Cyprus.


De Insulis In Mari Indico.
5 THe chiefe Ilands in the Indian Ocean, are Ormus, Diuision. Zeilan, Samatra, Aureae Iusulae, Borneo, Iaua Maior, Iaua Minor, Iapan, the Molucco, and the Philippian Ilands.
6 Ormus is of it selfe a kingdome, and commaundeth Ormus. most part of the Persian gulfe: it is exceeding barren, but the Citie Ormus (in which the Portugals doe hold a strong Castle) is so faire and full of trade, that they say there, if the world were a ring, Ormus ought to bee the stone thereof.
7 The Ile Zeilan is seated in Sinus Bengala, in which Zeilan. there are Fieldes whose grasse continually groweth, and Trees that are laden with fruit all the yeare long. Insomuch that some did thinke, that this was the place where Paradise stood. This Iland is subiect vnto the Mogor, notwithstanding the Portugalls doe hold a strong Castle in it.

 8 The Iland Samatra lyeth directly vnder the Aequator, Samatra. hauing in it a Fountaine which sendeth foorth water, that if it bee put into fire, doth not quench it, but makes it burne more vehemently. In it is also a Mountaine which sendeth foorth continuall flames of fire. The inhabitants of this Iland are Anthropophagi.
9 In Iaua Maior, the inhabitants are excellent Seamen, Iaua Maior great Pirats, which acknowledge Mahumet, and liue vpon Cats and Mise. Yet this Iland for the extraordinarie fruitfulnesse of it, was called by Scaliger, the Compendium of the world.
10 In Iaua Minor little is worth the noting, onely that Iaua Minor it doth flourish with Spices.
11 In the Iland Iapan, the inhabitants are very superstitious, Iapan. and great Idolaters, washing their children so soone as they bee borne in Riuers. They will neuer also come into the roomes where they dine or eate any thing, with their shooes on their feete, but keepe the places (as they tearme it) hallowed. This Iland hath very much golde in it, insomuch that Paule Venetus doth affirme, that in his time the Kings Palace was couered with gold.
12 The Moluccoe Ilands are famous for the great Moluccoes plenty of spices which are in them. There is also in these Isles a Bird, called Monicodiata, which hath no feete, continually flying without intermission. The female of this Bird doth lay her egges when shee breedes in a hole which is in the backe of the Male, like vnto a nest, and these are neuer taken before they dye and fall vpon the earth.
The inhabitants of these Ilands go naked, and are great Idolaters.

 13 The Philippian Ilands lye North of the Moluccoes, Philippians the ayre being very temperate, bringeth forth all kind of Spices.

De America, siue India Orientali.
HAuing discourst of three parts of the world, Europe, Africa, and Asia, I will now venter on the last and greatest part, which is America.
1 America is inuironed on the East with the maine Ocean, on the South Limits. with the Straights of Magelane, on the West with Mare Del Zur, or Pacificum, and on the north with the vnknowne Land.
2 This part of the world, was first discried by Christopher Columbus, in the yeare 1492. and then after that made better knowne by Americus Vesputius, of whome it is called vnto this day America.
3 The fruitfulnesse of this soyle is to be admired, for Qualitie. in it are wonderfull store of Spices, Birdes, and Fishes. There is also gold in such plenty, that the Spaniards haue reported they haue digged in some places more Golde then earth. The chiefest want in this part are Horses, of which they haue few or none, and which was the occasion, that when the Spaniards brought Horses in the battell against them, they fell down astonished, thinking that when the horses neighed, they had spoken vnto them.
4 The inhabitants of this mighty Territory, are most Inhabitants. barbarous, being in some places men eaters, they are altogether ignorant and vnlearned, which was the cheiefe
 cause that they conceited themselues, when any one of the Spaniards did read a letter, the Diuel told him the co^tents. They are ignorant of the vse of yron, and estimate glasse aboue gold. To conclude, they are excellent runners, and swimmers.
5 This fourth part of the world, is chiefly vnder the Gouernment King of Spaine, and is diuided first into two parts, Mexicana, and Peruana, afterwards subdiuided as followeth.

DE MEXICANA.
1 MExicana is limited on the east with Mare Del Norte, Limits. on the West with Mare Del Zur, on the South with an Istmus, betwixt Peruana and it, and on the North with the vnknowne land.
2 In this part of America are many Prouinces, the Prouinces. chief of which are Quiuira, Mexicana, Nicaragua, Iucatan, Florida, Virginia, Norumbega, Noua Francia, Terra Cortealis, and Estotiland.
3 The Prouince of Quiuira extendeth it selfe vnto Sinus Quiuira. Califormia, being a most dry and barren ground.
4 The Prouince of Mexicana was first found out by Mexicana. Ferdinando Cortesius, in the yeare 1518. There are in this place many Riuers, in which breede great store of Crocadiles, whose bodies the inhabitants doe eate. There are also many mines of golde. And there is a mountaine called Popochampeche, which doth continually vomit forth flames of fire. The chiefe and Metropolitane citie of this Prouince, or of whole America, is Mexico, in which the Prorex for Spaine doth lie, and in which there is both money coyned, and bookes printed.
5 The next is Nicaragua, wherin is a great lake which Nicaragua. hath no entercourse with the Sea, and yet doth ebbe and flow as the Sea doth. The people in this place are more
 manlike then others, both in behauiour and shape.
6 In Iucatan Chersonesus, the chiefe citie is Guatimala, Iucatan. where another Vice-Roy for Spaine doth lye. The inhabitants of this Countrey did adore the Crosse before Cortez comming.
7 Terra Florida (so called of the French, who first Terra Florida. founded it) hath in it many Prouinces, whereof Panuca is one, in which the people are very warlike, but butcherously minded, killing all the captiues they take, and eating them. Furthermore, they neuer marry vntil they be 40. yeares of age, and liue most vpon Serpents and worms. There is another place in this Prouince, called Alberdosia, wherin the women let their children sucke vntil they be 12. yeares of age.
8 Virginia (so nominated of our late Queene) was first Virginia. found out by Sir Walter Rawleigh, who gaue it that name. Of this Countrey what may be spoken more at large, see the discourse of Master Harriot, and Master Hackant.
9 Norumbega (so called of certaine fishes which are Norumbega. in it of that name.) The chiefe Citie of it is Norumbega.
10 Noua Frauncia lyeth neere vnto that great Sinus of Noua Francia. Saint Laurence. It was discouered and taken first of the French men, vnder Frauncis the first of France. The inhabitants of this Prouince haue little boats made of leather, which they vse to fish in, and when they haue done to take them vp at their backe, and carry them away.
11 Terra Cortealis, is little famous, vnlesse it be for a riuer Terra Cortealis. there, which is called the three brothers.
12 Estotiland was first found out by Anthony Zenus a Estotiland. Venetian, neere vnto which lyeth Fretum Dauis, where they haue sought oftentimes for a passage vnto the Moluccoes and China, but it could not be effected. Not far from
 this lyeth Newfound-land, fro^ whence commeth most of our fish. And in the North part lyeth a land, called by Sir Frauncis Drake, Noua Albion, of which nothing can bee certainely spoken.
13 Thus farre of the Prouinces of Mexicana, now followeth the description of Peruana.


De Peruana.
PEruana is in euery place inuironed with the Sea, vnlesse Limits. it be towards the North, where it is ioyned vnto Mexicana, by a little Istmus.
2 This part of America doth chiefly flourish with gold, Qualitie. pretious stones, Spices, Suger, and strange hearbs, among which is that hearbe Tobaco, which is so much, and idely vsed amongst vs.
3 The inhabitants of this place are generally cruell, Inuentions. rude, barbarous, and men eaters, not vnlike vnto those of Mexicana: They go naked, and if they take any man captiue, they slice his body out into collops, and broile it vpon the coales, making mery so long as that indures them. They are towards the South part mighty great men, being all Idolaters, worshipping the Diuell, or some monstrous mishapen Idole.
4 The chiefe Riuer of this Southerne part of America, Riuers. are three, the Riuer Amazon, Maragon, and the golden Riuer Rio, or de la Plate, in which there is found much gold and siluer.
5 This Peruana is diuided into foure great Prouinces Diuision. or Kingdomes, Castella Aurea, Peru, Chile, and Brasile: In each of which the King of Spaine hath his Agents.
6 Castella Aurea, doth comprehend in it the whole Istmus, Castella Aurea. which doth linke and tye the two parts of America together. In it are the two famous Ports or Hauens, in
 which the Spanish Ships are either laden for Spaine, or disburdened for America. The one called Theomina, or Nombre de Dios, the other Panamais.
7 Peru is limited on the North with Castella Aurea, on Peru. the West with Mare Pacificum, or the calme Sea, on the South with Chile, and on the East with a Mediterranean vnknowne. This place was found out by Frauncis Pizarus, in the yeare 1525.
8 The inhabitants of this Region are great Idolaters, Inhabitants. worshipping in some places blacke filthy sheepe, in other places Serpents. They are also such great men of person, that the Spaniards haue found teeth of them that were three fingers in breadth, and foure in length.
9 The fruitfulnesse of this countrey doth chiefly excell Qualitie. in the hearbe Tobaco, and Cocam, which if it be put into any mans mouth, it quencheth his thirst. And there is a certaine Beast, that when hee runneth away hath a bag hanging downe vnder his belly, into which his young ones conuey themselues. There is also such plenty of Gold, that the inhabitants care not for it, and when the Spaniards came thither first, they shooed their Horses with it. In this Prouince are the three riuers before mentioned in the generall description of Peruana.
10 The chiefe citie of this Kingdome is Michaelia, Citie. in which lyeth a Protex for Spaine.
11 Chile doth flourish in many things, but that which Chile. is of greatest note, there is a Riuer which in the day time doth runne, and in the night standeth still: the reason is, because this riuer lyeth vnder Mountaines, on which snow falling, in the day is dissolued, in the night congealed. The chiefe and Metropolitan City of this Prouince, is the citie of Saint Iames, in which lyeth another Protex for Spaine.

 12 Brasile is extended from the riuer Maragon, vnto Brasile. the straights of Mageian.
13 The inhabitants of this large Prouince, are sine Fide, Inhabitants Lege, and Rege: that is, without faith, law, or King. They are also such excelle^t swimmers, that they can tary vnder water for the space of an houre. They are very great dissemblers, shedding teares (which they haue alwayes in readinesse) when any of their friends come vnto them.
14 The fruitfulnesse of this Countrey lyeth much in Qualitie. Sugar, and a wood called Brasile, which is transported from thence into many parts of Europe. In this Country is also that Beast, called Pigritia, which in fifteene dayes will be going as farre as one can throw a stone. Here are also many strange Hearbes, whereof two are of most note. The first is the hearbe Copaibas, of which the excellent Balsomum is made, that cureth all greene wounds. The other is an hearbe, which of the Portugals is called Sentida, of Lincotanus Sentiens, and of others Viua, whose qualitie is, that if any one throw any thing vnto it, or touch it, it will shut his leaues, and will not open them vntill the partie which did displease it be departed Here are also neere vnto the Sea-shore, Fishes which will flye like vnto birds. And to conclude, here are trees of that bignesse, that there are as many families dwelling in one of the limbs of them, as are in some Parishes of England. Magin.





CAP. X.

De America Insulis.
THus farre of the continent and Kings contained in America: Now onely remaines the description of some few and particu-Ilands, and then I haue finished what in fine I wished.
1 The Ilands of America are diuided into those which Diuision. are in Mari Del Nort, and those in Mari del Zur.
2 The knowne Ilands in Mari Del Nort, are fiue, Hispaniola, Iamaica, Cuba, Caribum, and Cimbubon.
3 In the Iland Hispaniola there are many mynes of Hispaniola. Golde. The chiefe Citie in it, is Saint Dominicke, in which the Archbishop therof doth continually lye. This was the Iland which Columbus did first finde out.
4 In Iamaica, or the Iland of Saint Iames, little is to be Iamaica. obserued, onely that in it there is a Citie called Siuill, in which there is a faire Abby.
5 In the Iland Cuba, the Metropolitan Citie is Hauana, Cuba. so called, because it is the Hauen where all the Ships doe succour themselues, which come from Spaine vnto Peru, or the contrary.
6 In the Iland Caribum, the inhabitants are all Anthropophagi: Caribum. And from hence is brought that woade which is called Guaicum, or Lignum Sanctum.
7 In the Iland Cimbubon, there is a Tree very famous Cimbubon. for his leaues, which when they fall vnto the earth, doe creepe, hauing on either side thinges like
 vnto two feete, besides, if one offer to touch or come neere vnto them, they will moue, and offer to run away. Guilandinus reporteth it, and Scaliger in his 112. exercise against Cardanus.


De Insulis in Mari Del Zur.
1 IN Mari Del Zur, there are onely three Ilands which Haccari. are knowne, called Hacari, in which are great store of Golde.


Quem nos depictum vix recte aspeximus orbem,
Solius verbi fabrica sola fuit.
Illi igitur terrae qui fundamenta locauit,
Sit soli nostro gloria sola Deo.
