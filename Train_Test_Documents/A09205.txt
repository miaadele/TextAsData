VVElcome, welcome to our feast,
Euery vnderstanding guest,
From the Colledg^ and the Hall,
Welcome Academicks all,
Brittaines Magazins of Wit,
Iunes of Court repa^re to it,
And come Courtiers ye that be
The Mirrour of faire courtesie,
Citizens ye that were made
As well for learning as for trade,
Come braue spirits of the Real^e,
Vnshaded of the ACADEME
That in the Countrey there and here,
Like starres in midst of Clouds appeare.
M^ke no st^y for man by nature
Is a sociable Creature:
And braue Souldiers take a truce,
A while to reuell with his Muse,
Since our ^^^hor hath borne Armes too,
He cannot chuse but welcome you:
Come farre Ladyes ye that will,
Heere is nought obscure or ill,
And your ^^^ds Attendants, (...) ^
Witty wenches let them come,
By CYRRHA they shall welcome be,
To my Poet and to me,
My banquet is prepar'd for WIT,
Not FOLLY dare to touch a bit.

Pri'thee LAELIVS do^ me but the grace,

Or rather (which I take to be the right)
Thou canst endure no guest aboue a night?



Vpon FVMOSO. Epigram 4.
FVMOSO now beginning to decline
Takes onely care how he may come by coyne,
And dayly wisheth these BOHEMIAN ^arres

Moreouer England very well might spare
Ten hundred thousand men, enow to bea^,
The Emp'rour, Pope and Turke out of his seate:
Not that FVMOSO, trust me, meanes to fight,
Or dares march further then his chymneie^ sight,
A noted coward, but the ^ruth to tell,
^e hat^ a rusty musquet he would sell.

Vpon TAMB^RRO. Epigram 10.
TAM^VRRO now, what ere his friends do say,
At last will thriue, and all his debts go pay,
For by his wit (he boasts) and pleasing tongue,
H^hath won a ^ench that's wondrous faire and young,
Well borne, well qualifi'd, rich, modest, wise,
And shall be worth, if that an Vnckle dies,
In land foure hundred by the yeere, at least,

TThe Turkes hold this opinion very odde,
That madme^s soules are talking still with God,

If t^is be true their Alka^ons relate,
Our Puritans were sure in happy state.


Vpon BOONE. Epigram 15.

He stumbling fell into an empty trunke,
And laine a while did verily suppose,

By night was stollen by some cunning knaue.

But drawer cries, now for thy smallest drinke.

But last they should conue^^ed be to let?


Vpon Nasu^o. Epigram 19.

(First hauing drun^e and cough'd) quoth he my frend,
If that were true, my wife and I, I feare,
Should soone be sent for to the Arch-dukes Quire.


Vpon the A^se. Epigram 20.

To your respectfull fauours well I know^
I should as much adde to your worth as he
That guilds his di'mond, inke^ the Iuorie,
And by these Titles rather you dishonor,
Which euery wayting maid hath pinn'd vpon her
Now by her Masters Clarke; since praises commo^
As perruke^ are growne stale with euery woman.
So let me thriue as euer I abuse
Chaste Poesie, and prostitute my Muse,
T'vnworthinesse, or follow the hot sent
Of rising Greatnesse, with the rablement,
Or letter of an idle name rehearse,
Tha^'s empty of Desert in all my verse.

Whose frontispice is window all and glasse,
That doth both high-way and the town affront,
As if it bade obeisance to the Asse
Sir Coun^er-Puffe who is the owner on't.
You'ld little thinke that Barley and the Beant,
Affordes their purest manchet when they dine;
And that their only curre is growne so leane,
He is not able for to hold a Swine,

His coltes and groomes though yonder still are tabled^

Poore soules they haue; and looke where stand the bees^
Goodnesse a mee, see Madam where Thrist growes,
My Sweet-hart loues not it shold ^ouch his nose^
And by my patience, quoth the other, I
A^ ill abide this scuruy Honesty,
It beares no flower, nor carrie^ any smell,
Yet Country Ladies wear't and like it well.



To my Reader. Epigram 69.
MY Person is another as I list,
I now but act the Epigramma^ist.


To my towardly and hopefull Scholer Maister Edward Chamberlaine of Barnham Broome. Epigram 70.
NED, neuer looke againe those daies to see,
Thou liud'st, when thou appliedst thy booke with me,
What true affection bare we each to either,
How often walking in the fields together:
Haue I in Latin giu'n the names to thee,
Of this wild Flower, that Bent, this blossom'd tree,
This speckled Flie, that Hearb, this water rush.
This worme, or weed, the Bird on yonder bush?
How often when yee haue beene ask'd a play,
With voices viols haue we pass'd the day,
Now entertaining those weakeA set of 4 and 5 partes of the Authors re^dy for the presse. aires of mine,
Anon the deepe delicious Transalpine,
Another while with pencill or with pe^,
Haue limnd or drawn our friends pourtaies^ and then
Commixing many colours into one,
Haue imita^ed some carnation,
^trange field-found flower, or a rare seene flie,
^ curious land-schap or a clouded sky?
Then haply wearie of all these would goe,
Vnto thatA second volume of Emblemes, done into Latine verse with their pictures. Poeme I haue labourd so:
Thus past our leasu^eable howers away;
And yee did learne ^uen in the midst of play.


Vpon Corax. Epigram 71.
OLd Corax putting on glassen eine,
Bids Trudge his man to reach this booke of mine;
And by the fire in his w^eker chaire,
(One foote vpon the ^onges) me think I heare
Him cough, and say, this Author hath some wit,
Pitty hee made no better vse of it.


Vpon Sir Acolastus. Epigram 72.
HOdge art awake, what shall we do to day,
To cardes, go drinke, or else go see a play?
Not I Goddammee, I was last night drunke,
Rogue hold yee this key, and from my truncke,
Go fetch me out my sa^^en su^e de Roy,
My Mistres bracelet, and de'yee heare me boy,
A light, a pipe, and some Tobacco vp,
With ale, a to^t, a nut-meg, and a cup:
Let Patricke saddle chest-nut; and bid Meg,
Prouide's a dish of butter and an egge.
Thus like a mil-horse Acolastus treades
The selfe same circle, and this life he leade^,
Saue when he heares perhaps the sermon bel,
He^ keepes his bed, and that day is not well.


Vpon my selfe. Ep^gram 73.

LOoke how a Citie Tailor when he make^
A iouiall summer iourney to his mind,
In euery Towne will call for ale and cake^,
His wife set smiling in her coach be^ind,
Rapt with deligh^ to see the pride of May,
The frisking lambe^, and green geese by the way.


So now this Spring my merry Muse and I,
Must walke the world abroad and take the ai^e,
Who at our worke all Winter close did ly;
And our decaied spirits go repaire.
Then Enuy none our Mirth vpon the way,
For once a yeare, Apolo laughe^ they say.



Vpon Mildred. Epigram 74.
MIldred my Ladie Too-goods chambermaid,
Hath now her wage^ by her Maister paid,
Not quarterly, but duely once a yeare,
And in a purse as bigge as she can beare.



Vpon Mend-sh^^. Epigram 75.
MEnd-shoo did wa^e so deepe to dig for roote^,
At last he ran himselfe quite or'e ^he bootes.


Vpon Sir Simon Harpax. Epigram 76.
SIr Harpax when a Benefice doth fall,
Enqui^es about for him that will giue most^
For meri^ mooues him not a whit at all,
But must without it emptie kisse the post.
Yet if he feele some farmer gin ^o bite,
For's late commenced sonne, he tells him ^ha^,
His many yeares true seruice to requi^e,
He hath bestow'd the Graunt vpon his man;
Who to him goes, agrees and takes the gold,
To's Maister vse, when without more ado
Re^urning it, and by Sir Harpax ^old,
He pockets vp pe^haps a peece or two:
Hence Harp^x sweares, among his other shifts,
He none preferres but men of passing gif^s.



Vpon Crab. Epigram 78.
CRab being caught, and in the Sergeants power,
For shame and anger look'd both red and sower.


To Maister Iohn Browne of Sp^^kes in Tacolneston. Epigram 79.
I Told you, though you haue the world at wil^
To happines there somewhat wanteth still,
Which is not (as you haue) to haue a wife,
Tha^'s young and passing faire, to leade a life
Without disturbe, to haue a perfect health,
Abound in chargeles and vnpurchas'd wealth;
These are without one, and vnto a mind,
Soule-sick, skil-poore, or with ambition blind,
Confere no more vnto it's ease, say I,
Then do rich curtaines and a Canopie,
With pearle and gold embroyder'd all about,
Vnto my Lord who lies vpon the gout:
Though much content her^ from a man may find,
Who can denie? the fo^ntaine is ^he mind,
Whence must the soft and siluer streame arise,
To fence aswell as feede our Paradise.
Then as yee would some ^oodly fabrick r^^re,
Lay your foundation sure, the heauenly feare^
And pu^e religion, hereon let be pight,
Your liues strong frame that's ^onest and vprigh^,
Make ch^ise (a^ studdes) of ^rusty friends that will
Like hea^t of oke, not s^rinke for good or ill,
Not the rude rout who onely frendship measure
As they get by you, and one does them pleasure.
Of frendship, these, the base subsistence be,
And surfe^ of all ingenuitie,
These are the pies that on your peare-tree ^op,
But build to ea^e the fruite in Autumne vp,
Or these doubl^d throated layes, you find,
To ea^e your ^heries, leaue the stones behind:
Or haply fill'd their bellies f^om the ^ree,
Beray the bow, and so away they fl^e.
I then aduise you for to make your light,
Behind experience and a fore fore-sight,
Sith none knowes what may fall, close couerd lay
Vp somewhat to withstand a rainy day.
Let artes, good partes, a conscience cleere of sin,
Bee your best pride and household stuffe within,
Then lest the circle in your center rest,
And hold your selfe aboue a monarch blest.


Vpon my selfe. Epigram 80.
I thinke the Northmimmes in Hertfordshire neere to Saint Albanes. place that gaue me first my birth,
The genius had of epigram and mirth,
There famous Moore did his V^opia wright,
And thence came Heywoods Epigrams to light,
And then this breath I drew, wherewith (our owne)
These shaken leaues about the world are blowne.


Vpon Grantorto. Epigram. 81.

THe morrow after iust, Saint Georges day.
Grantorto pi^^ous drunke, sa^e in a di^ch,
His handes by^s side, his gelding straid away,
His scarlet hose, and doublet very rich,
With mudde and mine all beastly raid, and by
His feather huge and broad brimm'd hat did ly.


We ask'd the reason of his sitting there,
Zounds cause I am King Solomon (quoth hee)
And in my throne^ then for the loue we beare,
Replied my selfe, vnto your Maiestie,
Wee'le pull you out, and henceforth wish your grace
Would speak your prouerbs in a warmer place.




Vpon D^^^^. Epigram 8^.
I Du^^^ ask'd as we at supper sate,
How long he had liu'd in the married sta^e,
Sir, iust (quoth Du^mo) with my wife I met,
In the great plague time, I remember yet,
And ^ighing, as he would haue burst in twaine,
Said^ now almost the thirtieth of her raigne.


To R.H. my iouiall host at Viroche. Epigram 83.
I Wish old Robin that we had thee heere,
To lie a little with Sir Rossicleere,
He sweares the Persian summers are so whot,
That while he drank the Sun did melt the pot:
Thou swear'st, in Russia that it freezeth so,
That men with sneezing, off their noses throw.
He sayes that one day in a skirmish hot,
On's rapier point he tooke the flying shot.
Thou toldst me how an Irishman was slaine,
Shot through the braines, and after seru'd again.
He vo'wd that mans flesh was his only meate
In Rome, and neither bread not salt could get^
And thou reportedst, how at Remingham,
A leaguet was, and thou therein the same,
Where th' horse dranke vp so dry a running flood,
That some were choak'd with fishes in the mud.
He saies the Morgor mus'd how England can,
As was himselfe afford so braue a man.
Thou in all townes throughout the Netherland,
Swearest thou hast swordes lie prest at thy command.
Thus at the Tru^^ yee much at one do roame,
Saue thou liest neerer, fa^^her hee from home.


Vpon Rinaldo and Reiner. Epigram 84.
RInaldo meeting Reiner in the streete,
Deepe in his debt, he thus doth ^einer greete,
You know some money is betwixt vs two,
That welny now these ten yeares hath beene due^
Quoth Reiner, looking downe vnto his f^ete,
I' faith and we will part it, if I see't,
But as I liue Rinaldo I find none,
As faine as you, I would you had your owne.


Vpon Saburro. Epigram 85.
SAburro now hath sold both house and lands,
Exceeding much vpon his gentry stands,
Auer^ing how his Ancestrie and name,
From Normandi^ in with the conquest came.
Saburro should thy gentries plea stand good,
Then ^ag and rag might be of gentle blood.



Vpon Milo. Epigram 86.
MIlo beleeues and hath a wager laid,
The world will end within these fourteene yeare,
By whom or where the mony sh^ll be paid,
But if he winnes is Milo's onely feare.


To my ingenious pupill, and most honest atturney Maister Iohn Cock, of Deepham. Epigram 87.
IF Reason be the soule of law, I faine
In this point (pupill) would resolued bee,
How is it that a statute doth maintaine,
That when the law defines the contrarie,
Yet reason though far stronger, must giue place;
And law against reason carry cleare the case.


To my very friend Maister Thomas Augush. Epigram 88.
VVIth other friend^ I bid you to my feast,
Though comming last, yet are you not the least.



Vpon Lodronio. Epigram 89.
LOdronio like a huge Westphaly swine,
Lies close and neuer stirres without his doore^,
Feedes of the best, drinkes sack and claret wine,
And at command'ment hath his lease of whores,
That death this hog would stick, the parrish pray,
For to his hand hee's soundly sing'd they say.


Vpon Rombo. Epigram 90.
ROmbo doth banne, chase, deepely curse and sweare,
And vowes reneng'd o'th parish for to bee,
For that his name's not in their Register,
Which he so foule a iourney tooke to see,
(Not that he is to take vp any landes;
And one and twentie, that lost labour were,
But of his last abode to bring some hands,
To saue him from a burning through the eare)
That for it now he must be faine to looke,
In Newgate or the Poultry Counter booke.


Vpon Rusco. Epigram 91.
RVsco to London hauing brought his sonne,
To bind him prentise, asked of the lad,
What trade best lik'd him, for he must take one,
And onely stick to that he chosen had:
Then father, if vnto an Alderman,
For seuen yeares I were bound, I did not care,
So after I my time had seru'd (quoth Io^n)
I might be sure for to be Lord Maior.


Vpon Augustus Caesar. Epigram 92.
AVgustus hearing how a Roman knight,
Whose goods could not pay halfe his debts, was dead,
Yet liuing slept at quiet ^uery night,
Sent to his house and needes would buy his bed,
Beleeuing sute it had some virtue rare,
That in his case could keepe a man from care.


Of a Spaniard and a Hollander. Epigram 93.
AN Hollander and a Spaniard one day met,
Within their Inne, and downe to dinner set,
Each did begin his country to commend,
And rec^on vp the riches it did lend.
What ^ay you (quoth the Spaniard) to our land,
Where (taking vp an Orenge in his hand)
These golden apples thrice a yeare do grow,
(...) faire as those Hesperides in show,
(...) they which nimble Atalanta staid,
(...) it which Paris gaue the Cyprian maid?
(...) on a Holland cheese by, claps his hand;
And in the honor of his Belgick land,
Replies, And what can you to Holland say,
Of these that yeelds vs thousands For in Holland as oft as they milke they make their ^^eeses, which is thrice a day: thrice a day?


To Sir Ninian Ou^c^^^. Epigram 94^
AS Tarlion when his ^ead was onely seene,
The Tire-house doore and Tapistrie betweene,
Set all the mulltitude in such a laughter,
They could not hold for scarse an houre after,
So (Sir) I set y^^ (as I promis'd) ^orth,
That all the world may wonder at your worth.


Vpon Albi^^s. Epigram 95.
ALbinus much the other day did blame,
Neates-foote his man for haunting common whoores,
And somewhere wish'd him get a wife ^or shame,
Or else next quarter get him out of doores.
A wife (quoth Neates-foote) neuer while I breath,
I got one lately, but within this mile,
When as I thought to die no other death,
For iust her husband tooke vs in the while.



Vpon Methusus. Epigram 96.
MEt^usus asked me why I called him so^,
I answere made, because he lou'd the pot,
For while Met^usus busie i^ with it,
The foole I'me sure's as busie with his wit.

A Flock of Feld-fares, thine, vpon the coast,
Taking their leaue^, and by them, Fare-well Frost.


To honest Rafe. Epigram 101^
AN embleme, R^^e, thou didst request of me,
A cudgell lying in an apple tree,
Be thine, and since, thou art i'th Gaole^ I heare
Thy Po'sie, I am lodged for thi^ yeare.


Epigram 102^
WHy do Sir Iohn, Sir H^ry, and Sir H^gh,
All winter long themselues like cucko^es hide,
Wi^hin good Townes, and seldome come in view,
Saue euery halfe yeare when their rent^ are paid?
I do imagine (though but my presumption)
They lie at Physick for the Purse consumption.


To the ingenious and excellent in Po^sie Maister Thurstane Smith. Epigram 103.
MY noble Thurstane, I do maruaile much,
How thy braue Muse did find her selfe employ'd
In Norwic^, spun she Iersey with the Dutch,
O^ lo^t she ought, and so there had it cri'd?
May be, she look'd for ^omething in the waggon,
Or wish'd to make a speech befo^e the dragon.


To my euer loued scholler Maister H^^mond Claxton. Epigram 104.
I Prithy Ham^ond do thy labour spare,
To aske me what I lacke, as I do passe
Your shop in Cheape, with sir, Heere ^a^tens are,
Good three pil'd veluets, taffa^a^, gold lace:
But let me Hammond go in quiet by,
For thou knowst what I lacke as well as I.


Vpon Dorinda. Epigram 105.
THe faire Dorinda dressed c^p a pie
In state, resembles Cambridge Trinitie,
Her, her all turret, and of wondrous cunning,
Her back-side broade, and front full faire in shew,
Onely her teeth stand like old rotten Row.


Vpon Sir Dolphin. Epigram 106.
SIr Dolphin can endure no disgrace,
And present death 'tis to giue him the lie,
Yet is he drunke in euery ale-house base,
In Tapsters, Whoores, and Tinkers companie.


Vpon Sir Gra^eles. Epigram 107.
WHile grim God-damm^e, at my Ladies table,
Chewing the cudde of vengeance still did fit;
And (lately bastinado'd) was not able,
For melancholy to digest a bi^,
But tearing heauen with feareful oathes did threate,
The flesh of that base slaue must be his meate;
And would haue sayd, A dagger he should bui^,
Mistaking swore, A begger he would die.
A Lattin dis^ich which a Frier of Shertogen Bosch in Brabant wrote in my Greeke Testament, while I was busie p^rusing some bookes in their Library, intituled^


Ad Angliam ve^tram. Epigram 108.

ANgelus indiderat, dicas, anne Anglia no^en,
Spirituum siquis Lucifer ille fuit.

Thus in English.

Say England, did an Angell christen thee?
If any, surely Lucifer wa^ he.

His back being turn'd, I left this behind me, in the first printed page of a faire Arias Montanu^ bible, to require him.



Ad Syluam D^cis. Epigram 109.

DIcere. Sylua Ducis cur falso nomine, sylu^
Cum ca^^as, sterilis stagnet et om^is ager?
Fallor, an in d^^os arb^r mutatur adse^s,
In Monachum stipes qu^m stipe vulgus ali^.

Which is in English,

Why falselie art thou^ call'd the Dukes-wood, when
Thou hast no woods, and all thy feildes are fenne?
Thy Trees (I ghe^se) are turn'd to sainted stocks,
And begging Friers haue robb'd thee of thy blocks.



Vpon Ell^^ Epigram 110.
FRom Norwich e're since Ello had his wife,
He neuer led one minute quiet life,
For if but steppes with friends to drinke, he sweares
She comming beates the po^s about his eares,
Or if the Hos^esse in his presence be,
Downe go the windowes, and yee rogue, saies she,
Faith haue I found your haunt, what close with her,
Directly home yee foule toad^bellied curre:
Haue patience Ello, who knew euer yet,
B^t that a piece of No^wich stuffe would fret?



Epigram 111.
I One thing Coriat like, whe^ I was ouer,
Obs^ru'd in Andwarp, Arnhem, and Scon^ouer
Among the Du^ch, which was they write aboue,
Inne doores, the name (as euery man did loue)
Of seuerall beeres within the house t^ey haue,
As R^^mers, Wesops Andwarps, and the ^ra^,
With Delfts, Breda's, Lubbs, Boga^'^, Engl^sh, and
As many ^orts as Cities in the land.
Yet though the beere of sund^y natures be,
In their being drunke no difference did ^ see.


Vpon Apodemon. Epigram 112.
GReat Apodemon surely much hath seene,
Since in all l^nde^ he vnder heauen ha^h beene;
And can of ^^tch as readily relate,
Their liuing lawes, their boundes, their wealth and star^
As if in twice twelue houres he had gone,
With Sol the worlds bounds in procession.
Arabi^ much be praiseth for her smell^,
Persis ^o^ silkes, her gemmes and pearly shells;
For poo^e and barren then he doth condemne,
The land of Iury with Hierusalem,
Virginia, he likes not, cause their aire is f^ggy,
Swede's rich in siluer, Hungary in gold,
E^gland is temp' rate, Muscouie's too cold,
But since the pox some few daies since he got,
He neuer ^els how Fran^e he found too hot^



Vpon Saint Maries Steeple. Epigram 113.
SAint Maries steeple's vp and ready soone,
But Paules 'tis thought will lie abed till noone^


Vpon Oenopolio. Epigram 114.
ERewh^le there was in Nigers streame (I read)
A Iewell found of price inualued.
For Nature this, one rude and massy stone,
Had cemented of euery pretious one,
To shew her skill or make some finder, poore
For wealth, to equall the greatst Emperour.
The Diamo^d disdaining borrowed light,
Was heere ioyn'd with the golden Chrysolite,,
The Iacyn^th mixed with the Sa^byre blew,
The Topaze Rubie with his fiery hew:
He^re Opals Emeralds of glassy greene,
The Sardonyx with Nigers Pearles were seene:
I neuer saw this wonder, but suppose,
It much resembled Oenopolio's nose.


Vpon Furno. Epigram 115.
FVrno (ith gaole) commends the dayes of old,
And those same times, our Poets say, were gold,
His fate vpbraiding which did giue him birth,
In this worst age of iron, when from earth,
A^trea's fled (his) valour wants regard,
Religion practise, learning her reward,
An iron age indeed that Furno fe^^es,
When iron hourely followe^ him at heeles^


Vpon a Duch Boore, and his answere to Charles the fif^. Epigram 116.

THe famous Charles when hauing lost his way,
By Hessens Lan^graue Maurice hard pursu'd,
And all a winters rainy night did s^ray,
He knew not whither thorough thick^ts rude,
He saw a light, the dwelling of a Boo^e,
And thither rode and knocked at his doore.


And calling to him kenneld in his bed,
In gentle wise did craue the time of night;
Tis all by three, in churlish wise he sayd;
The Emperour asking how he knew so right
Without a clock, Gots sacreloten, how
(Replied the Boore) ^^skellam, pi^^'d but ^ow.



Vpon Theorbo. Epigram 117.
THeorbo both in earnest and in sport.
Must beare a part in euery company;
And will be heard the loudest in consort,
(...) s^ldome mute or out of tune is he,
(...) ^hen he wants a case vnto his back,
Or fe^res (at Tyborne) a base string to crack.


Vpon Taurus. Epigram 118.
I'St true that Taurus late hath lost his wit?
How can that be when neuer he had it?
I could beleeue it, had he fought a fray,
And so perhaps his fingers cut away.


Vpon Sir Tristram. Epigram 129.
SEe yee Sir Tristram yonder on the stage,
With the huge feather and his snout-faire page,
A fearefull neate^ tongue hanging by his side,
With a stilletta to his girdle tied,
The very same whom Druso's prentise met,
The other day and challeng'd for a d^bt
Some nine yeares owing; when Sir Tristra^ drew,
And in his furie at the prentise flew,
Who mildly crau'd a word within his eare,
(For shame, ^aid he, it is to quarrell heere)
And (...) ^^emselues they might but next day meete,
In Fi^soury, where he hit debt should quit
By valour, or be lyable to it.
It was ag^eed, next morrow both gone out,
Met, drawne, and ready for to haue about,
How long to fence, quoth Tristram, hast thou gone,
S^^uen ye^res, quoth' prentise: twenty now ^nd one,
My sword, sayd Tri^^ra^, haue I practised:
Th^n he^re me fellow, it may not be ^ayd,
I euer wrong'd thee (for by all the God^,
A gentleman ^ am, and scorne the oddes,)
Go four^te^ne yeares yet longer to thy fenc^,
I'le meete thee heere ag^ine two seuen yeares ^^nc^^
On equall termes, and then God-damme^ ^ight,
And by this hand-la do thee any right.


Epigram 120.
SArtor at Leyde^ hath commenc'd, they say,
And come a leaden Doctor thence away.


To my very worthy and honest ^riend Maister Robert Constable of Hingham, high Constable of the hundred of Foreh^w. Epigram 121.
As pretious wares we see are often wrapt
In paper^ small, so farc^ it with me now,
Who in these leaues my deares^ loue haue lapt
And sent it as a token vnto you,
Who of a Constable deseru^ to be,
A Iustice for your brain^ and honestie.
