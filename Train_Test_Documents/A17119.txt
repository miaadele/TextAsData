Quatuor hasce cruces clypeo coniunxit in vno (Quas ergò nemo separet) ipse Deus. THE PREFACE, OR Argument of this Poësy. D Amaetas hauing long bin a wood∣man had obserued the natures, & propertyes of many trees, and ap∣prehended there was some miste∣ry, and some peculiar maiesticall matter in the Genest, more then he could discipher. Whereupon hee went to Silenus a man of great learning and authoritie (for he was held a Pro het) and exposeth to him his conceit, and prayeth earnestly his ayde. Silenus entertaineth him curteously, and is very willing, (and by the meanes of a late accident) well able to rese ue him: for (saith he): there was a complaint mad ately to our great God Apollo against certaine vnworthy fellowes, which presumptuously tooke garlands of his anci∣ent tree the Laurell without leaue. Whereat he ha∣uing indignation, determined to take order for that, and such like abuses. And foorthwith calling the Muses to counsell in Helicon established ordinances for the due wearing of that & of al other Ghirlands. And because the ancient Ghirlands were abused, & prophaned with common and vnworthy vse, hee made choice of a new tree (viz) the Genest, and in∣stituted Ghirlands thereof, and gaue to them praero∣gatiues aboue the rest, & appropriated them to one imperial family seated in Britania, or Albion rather. Vide stanz 17. and it is taken out of Orpheus in his Argo∣naut: where Ma. Cam∣den rather readeth then . Albion or Alba, rather then Pi∣naria, and iudiciously. Leuceessa : & with expresse defence that none else should weare them. And that not all the Princes of this family should haue Garlands hereof, but to some of them better deseruing should be permitted a chappelet, and to the rest but a branch, or Plante of the Genest. But the chiefe Garland of Genest complete and adorned with diuers sacred flowers should be reserued for his fauorite Daphnis (the most puissant, and the most vertuous, and (in briefe) the most true heroycall Prince of that imperiall race) ordained long-since by the highest aeternall wisedome to reconcile the olde, and vnnaturall fewd betweene Locrine, and Albanact, to reduce all the Britannik Isles into one entyre mo∣narchy, to restore the ancient vnity of religion, lawes, and language in this great Iland, and finally to extend the limit of his Empyre as farre, as they were in the times of Albion, of Brutus, of Artur, of Edgar, or of any other our monarkes, whose domi∣nions were largest. Thus farre Apollo's decree. After this Silenus declareth more particularly, who, and what these royall Worthyes were, which should beare, or weare Chappelets, or Garlāds of the Genest tree, and lastly the Garland complete. Beginning with that great Henry sonne of the Em∣presse Matilda (the first King of this Iland surnamed Plantagenet ) and so deducing a genealogy from him through his royall posterity to our present sacred Soueraign IAMES, He was also surnamed Courtmantel. his now next heire, and ne∣phew, whom the Prophet herein styleth the true Polystephanus, the Peace-maker, King Arturs succes∣sor, great Aedgars heire, high Seneschall of Albion, the great Briton &c. And crowneth his head with this imperiall Polyanthine Ghirland, and his raigne with all the blessings of peace, victory, long life, a rare fayre wife, hopefull Princely issue, and a perpetuall succession of their posterity in the Empire of great Britain. And now to that obiection touched in the dedi∣catory, and made because I deriue not this title, and genealogy from some of the ancient monarkes of this Isle Britons, or Saxons, or at the least from King William the Conquerour, I must answere that to haue chosen any of the most ancient Kings, I must haue looked so farre backe, as I should not onely haue made this Eclog ouer-long, and tedious, but also haue lost my selfe in the cloudes of obscurity by soring too high amongst them (as they know, which know what our ancient storyes bee.) But as for William the Conquerour there be many reasons why I should not begin with him (although I goe as neere him, as his sonnes daughter) for firstly, he was a bastard, (and yet not that of the blood royall of England ) hauing no title to the Crowne but vio∣lence, and his sword as he confessed, Vide lib. S. Stephani Cadomensis de Guliel∣mo conqu storre editum. an. 1603. and thereof had remorse of conscience at his death. Secondly he was neuer possessed of the one halfe of Britain, for hee had neither Scotland, nor Wales, and in Ireland he not one foote. Furthermore Girard Du-Haillan and o∣ther French antiquaries according to their Salike he∣raldry say that his lyne ended in his sonne King Hen∣ry the first: for all they holde as a maxime, ( La famille se continué es masles, Philosalicus. et se finist aux filles. ) And yet Du-Haillan (notwithstāding, or forgetting this) affirmeth in an other place, that the race of the Kings of Eng∣land issued out of the house of Aniow (viz) from our great Henry, In Summaire des ducs, et contes d' Aniov. and his ancesters) continueth vntill this day. From whom there be many reasons on the o∣ther side, why I should deduce the genealogy of our Kings passed, and of our present Soueraigne Lord King IAMES : for this great Henry was not onely rightfull heire, K. Henry the second, the greatest king &c and King of England, but also the greatest King (of whom there is any credible story extant) which hath been in this Isle of Britain since the time of the Romaine Emperous (who were repu∣ted Lords of all the world) and which thus I demon∣strate, and briefly. He was King of England in the right of his mother Matilda the Empresse, daughter and heire to King Henry the first, by Matilda Bona daughter of King Malcolm Canmoir, King Malcolm knigh∣ted this K. H. the secōd at fifteene yeeres of age, Novbrig. who writeth much in the honour of this king Malcolm. lib. 2. cap. 20. and of Margaret his wife, who was the daughter of Edward Exul the Saxon Prince the sonne of Edmond Ironside King of England Anno Dom. 1016. This Edmond was sonne and heyre to King Etheldred, who in ancient char∣ters is written Totius Britanniae rex (quod nota ) be∣cause a late Anonymus in a little booke dedicated to his Maiesty, affirmeth that neuer any Prince was king of this whole Isle vntill now: But he is deceiued for (besides Constantius Chlorus and his sonne our coun∣triman Constantine the great, Constans, Aurelius Am∣brosius, Vter, & others (which were Lords of all great Britaine) Edgar also the father of this King Ethel∣dred was absolute Monarke of this Isleland, and so puissant in forces both by land, and sea, as hee was surnamed the Great, and was stiled Totius Albionis basileus, & Anglici orbis basileus (as G. Malmesburien∣sis & Florentius Wigorniensis witnesse. Whereupon (to note also by the way) some thinke that the word Anglia was sometimes vsed for the whole Isle, Britannia ab aduentu Saxonum in insulam appellatur Anglia Ioān. Salisbur, in Policra∣tico. and which Ion Lidgate disertly asseuereth in King Ar∣thurs complaint in these words, Great Britain now cal∣led England: so likewise doth Geffrey Chaucer in the Franklins tale (viz.) In England, that Clepid was Britain : And Ranulfus Cestrensis a grauer Authour peremptorily affirmeth that King Egbert after his conquests ordained, Ranulfus Higeden in Polichronic. and commaunded that the Saxons, and Iutes should bee called Angles, and that Britain should bee called England : But I leaue this to be discussed by antiquaryes. And to re∣turne to the ancient Saxon Kings progenitors of this Henry, and also possessors of this whole Isle (as I will shew for the better confirmation of that, which I haue said against the opinion of this Anonymus. ) In diuers ancient records and charters of donati∣ons of these kings to Monasteries, and to Cathedrall Churches, and in other ancient monuments, I haue obserued these seuerall stiles, Ex archiuis Cisce∣streasis Ecclesiae by the fauour of the reuerend D.

These three last stiles I finde in the history of Ingulfus Abbot of Croyland transcribed by him from the Charters of that Mo∣nastery. And the other two before going, are copyed out of the records of the Cathedrall Church of Chicester, as also these three next following. Ego Eadwis , sub. rex.

I finde also (in Asser Meneuensis) Aelured or Aelfred a more an∣cient Saxon King then these written Omnium Britān. insulae Christianorum rector. An. Dom. 872. Io. Asser in histor. de Gestis Ealfredi. And Edward (surnamed Pius, and Confessor) was from the yeare of our Lord 1050. King of this whole Isle (if there be any credite to be giuen to our stories) and was stiled rex Albionis, as Ion Twine auoweth out of his charters giuen to the Abby of Abingdon. Io. Tvvinus in Albi∣onicis. And that same King Etheldred before cited, I haue seene this char∣ter in the hands of Ma. of Holland, a learned Gentleman, & a good antiquary. was sti∣led in the charters of Glastonbury, Aetheldred Angli∣cae nationis, caeterarum{que} gentium triniatim intra am∣bitum Britān. insulae degentium &c. basileus, and ano∣ther K. in old inscription, Britanniae Anax: Sigillo. V. and many such more, which were too long to recite. And some kings of the Norman race (which is more rare) haue been so stiled For the Lord Bishop of Bristow vouch∣eth a coine of King Ion, Ion B. of Bristow in his first treatise about the vnion. wherein is stamped Ioānes rex Britonum. but that coine which his Lordship shewed to me had the armes of little Britain vpon the reuerse: but his grandchild King Edward the firsty & after him king Edward the third were greater mo∣narkes here then he. Vide Tho. VValshing∣ham in K. Edvv. 1. & in Ed. 3. But this great Henry Plantage∣nets Empire extended beyond the bounds of the Britannish world; and his greatnes so farre exceeded all other kings his ancesters, Io. Praesul Carnotensis in Polycratico. that he was stiled Maxi∣mus Britanniae regum, as I will shew by and by, and by good right: for besides this his great Britain and Ireland, he was possessed of a great part of France, and by these titles. K. Edw. 3. erected A∣quitain into a Prince∣dome for his eldest sonne Edw. He was Duke of Normandy by right of inheritance from his granfather King Henry the first Duke of Normandy &c. He was Duke of Aquitain (that is) Gascoin, and Guien (sometimes a kingdome) and Earle of Poictow by the mariage of Queene Elianor daughter & heire of William Duke Ican de la Hay. of Aquitain and Earle of Poictow (whose wife Ieanne was daughter of Dauid king of Scots ) he was Earle of Aniow (seminary of kings) of Touraine, and of Maine (his natiue country) by right of enheritance from his father Geoffrey Le Bel Earle of them all. Gyr. du Hailian en la sommaire des contes d' Aniovv. &c. He sway∣ed all in litle Britain ; which authority he acquired partly by the mariage of Constance daughter and heire of Conan Earle of Britain with his third sonne Geffrey Earle of Richmont, but chiefly by his swoord: as it appeareth by Gu: Neuburgensis, who then liued, and thus writeth. Lib. 11. cap. 18. Cum a potentioribus in Britannia in∣feriores premerentur, regis Anglorum auxilium expe∣tentes, eius seditioni spontaneè subdiderunt &c. ipsos{que} potentes viribus subegit, sic{que} in breni tota Britannia po∣titus est. He also conquered Auuergne : and thus much for his possessions in France: and now to Ireland. He twise inuaded that kingdome, and by armes secon∣ded with the letters of fauour of his good friend Pope Adrian (an Englishman) hee brought the discording Princes there, Giraldus Cambrens. in Hiber. expugnata & G. Càmden. to submit theyr differents and their ty∣tles to him, and so obtained the possession of the Isle. And as for those parts, & partyes in this our great Britain (viz) of Engl. Scotl. and Wales (which did not acknowledge his souerainty) hee reduced them in good time to the ancient subiection, and obedience, which they owed to the British, & Saxon kings his pro¦genitors. The Welshmē in their stories acknowledge this, & in their loyalty & dueties (as the English) liue¦ly expresse it euery day. But for the other (if any doubt be made) G. Neuburgensis (veridicus autor as Polidore Vergill obserueth him) will thus satisfie him, speak∣ing of this K. Henry, G. Neuburg. lib. 2. cap. 38. & of Dauid K. of Scots his priso∣ner, being then both at Yorke. Occurrit eirex Scotorum cum vniuersis regni nobilibus, qui omnes in ecclesia bea∣tissimi apostolorum principis, regi Angliae, tanquam principali domino hominium cum ligeantia (id est) solemni cautione standi cum eo, et pro eo contra omnes homines (rege proprio praecipiente) fecerunt. Ipse quo{que} rex Sco∣torum coram vniuersa multitudine nobilium vtrius{que} regni regem Anglorum modis solemnibus dominum suum, seque hominem et fidelem eius declarauit, ei{que} tria praecipua regni sui munimina (scilicet Rokesburk, Berwik, et Castellum puellarum loco obsidum tradi∣dit &c. But Ion Bishop of Chartres maketh his Em∣pyre yet much greater, Io. bish. Carnotensis in Polycratico. for hee boundeth it to the Southward with Spaine, and to the Northward with the Isles of Orkney, and mought as well (if it had pleased him) with the North pole (as Giraldus Cambrensis did) and then styleth him Maximum Britanniae regum 1. the greatest of the Kings of great Britaine vt supra : And Giraldus goeth fur∣ther, for he compareth him with the great Alexan∣der, and ascribeth (as some interpret) the first disco∣uery of the West Indies (which was made by Madok, D. Povvell. a yonger son of Owin Gwineth Prince of Northwales An. Dom. 1170.) to this King, because it was done by his auspices: as we may as well also attribute to him the redeeming of our great Artur from the iniuri∣ous imputation of a fabulous Heros, because he cau∣sed his monument to be sought out (which was sunk deep within the ground in the Isle of Aualon ) by the occasion of a Bardes song, D. Powel in the histo∣ry of the Princes of Wales. which he heard in Pē∣broke. But I will set downe Giraldus his owne words written in maner of a Panegyrick to this king, and in my conceit elegant enough for those times. Certant cum orbe terrarum victoriae vestrae a Pyrenaeis enim mon∣tibus vsque in occiduos, Sil. Giraldus in Topo∣graphia Hiberniae cap. 47. & 48. Distinct. 3. et extremos Borealis Oceani fi∣nes Alexander noster occidentalis brachium extendisti.

Qualiter fulguranti aduentus vestri lumine attoniti occidentales reguli tanquam ad lucubrum auiculae ad vestrum statim imperium conuolauerunt ? And much more, which for breuity I omit. Ioan. Saresbur. in Poli∣cratico lib. 8. cap. 24. That which the Bishop of Char∣tres writeth of him before mentioned and promised, is thys: Rex illustris Anglorum Henricus secundus re∣gum Britanniae maximus &c. circa Garumnam fulmi∣nat, et Tolosam falici cingens obsidione, non modò pro∣uinciales, vs{que} ad Rhodanum, et Alpes territat sed muni∣tionibus dirutis, populis{que} Profligatis. suba lis (quasi vniuersis prae∣sens. immineat) timore principes cōcussit Hispanos, et Gal∣los. And to these I will adde onely Will. of Neubo∣roughs elogie for a Corollarie. G. Neuburg. lib. 11. Regis supra omnes, qui vnquam hactenus in Anglia regnasse noscebantur, latius dominantis (hoc est) ab vltimis Scotiae finibus ad montesvs{que} Pyrenaeos nomen in cunctis regionibus ce∣lebre habebatur &c. Hunc finem habuit inclytus ille rex Henricus . inter reges terrarum nominatissimus, et nulli eorūvel amplitudine opū, vel faelicitate successuū secundus. And thus much for the testimony of the greatnes of his conquests, & of his Empire▪ as for his other great∣nesses (viz) of his wisedome, of his iustice, of his magnanimity, of his bounty and other heroycall vertues I shall not need to produce any proofe, for his wise and politik administration of his great affay∣res, and estate, his victoryes and hygh acheeuements secretly intimate them at the full. He was also well learned, as Giraldus affirmeth, Gyral. Cambr. and (which was his best prayse) he was very charytable, and pious, ( in∣comparabilis Eleemosynarum largitor, et praecipuus ter∣rae Palestinae sustentator. ) And Radulph de Diceto wri∣teth that in the time of an extreame dearth in Aniow and Maine hee releeued with bread ten thousand people dayly from Aprill till haruest. An Dom. 1176. And William of Newborough addeth that he receiued with great de∣uotion the character of the sacred Militia for the re∣couery of the holy land. Vide S. Giraldum in Topograp. Hibern. Distinct. 3. cap. 48. & in Hiber. expug∣nala lib. 1. cap. 45. And afterward (because he was not able to goe by reason of infirmities, and for the great daungers wherein his estate should stand in his absence which Giraldus sheweth) hee gaue to∣ward this expedition the summe of 47. M. li. or there abouts. Io. Sto. in Anna Iean de la Haye also writeth that hee built S. Andrews Church in Bourdeaux, and S. Pe∣ters in Poitiers, and founded a Bishops sea there, and enlarged the towne by the one halfe. Hee reedified the Abby at Waltham in Essex, Fabian. du Haillan es contes, & D. d' Aniov. and the Charterhouse of Witham in Wiltshire. He repaired and much beau∣tified the Monastery of font Euerard (or Fronteuaux ) neere Egle in Normandy: and founded the Priories of Staneley, He loued Hunting and hauking exceedingly. Girald. and of Douer. He also began the stone∣worke of London bridge, which was finished by his Sonne King Ion (or caused to be finished) for it is all one to a common wealth. He first kept Lyons, & made of the armes of Normandy (viz) the two Leopards, and of the single Lyon of Aquitain one coate of armes for Engl. as it is yet borne. Nic. Vpton. And he instituted the cir∣cuits of the Iudges: and not to be tedious in the e∣numeration of such particulars) in a word he was (as Ion Carnotensis who knew him well) testifieth, rex optimus apud Britānias, Normanorum, et Aquitano∣rum dux faelicissimus, Io.

Wherunto for bre∣uity I recommend. the Reader. quam prudens, et modestus quam pius ab ip∣sa (vt ita dicam infantia) fuerit, nec ipse liuor silere, nec dissimulare potest: cum opera recentia, et manifesta sint &c. And after those his great workes, and all his high achiuements, his victoryes, his trophees of his heroy∣call, and christian vertues, and a long and happy raigne, he departed at Chinon in Touraine, in the 35. yeere of his raigne, and in the 61. yeere of his age An. Do. 1189. and was with all due funerall pompe enter∣red, at Fronteuaulx, and vpon his tombe had this in∣scription engrauen. Sufficit hic tumulus cui non suffecerat orbis, Res breuis ampla satis, cui fuit ampla breuis. Rex inuictus eram, mihi plurima regnasubegi, Multiplici{que} modo dux{que}, comes{que} fui.

Quod potes instanter operare bonum, quia mundus Transit et incautos mors inopina rapit. Thus this great Henry left his great name, and his glory to the world: and his Kingdomes and his do∣minions to his posterity the Princes aranged, and en∣rouled in this following Poesy. Vnto which his Empire I dare affirme, & vpon the present allegata, et probata conclude, that neuer any Prince heyre ge∣nerall of this kingdome had so many, so ancient, & so lawfull titles as Hee, to whose happy inauguration this humble verse is consecrated.

Diodor. Sic. Amid whose vertues maze I would require A line of any learned wiserds lore: The Plante of Genest chiefly I admire, Whose humble highnes makes me oft surmise, Humilitas scala caeli.

That lowly steps be ladders to the ski's. 2 For well I wist though Genest doth not dwell In proudest soile, nor tops of mountaines hye, She shews by this, that she foreseeth well The perils, which doe all extreames impend.

Of parts of man, which onely duty tyes To bowe to Kings, and to their Creatour. O iust respects, who can so well deserue For to commaund, as one that knows to serue? 4 And that the Genest doth by nature holde A speciall honour of aeternall green: And that hir boughs be charg'd with flowr's of gold: And many such like graces more I wot: But in my minde long this conceit hath been, That yet the greatest wonders I weet not. And I am wont this tree oft to compare To that, which is in all the world most rare. Vide stanz 54. 5 Now good Silenus, as you are a man Endew'd with passing skill, and mystick art, Enforme me rightly, (for I know you can) What be the other mysteries of this tree: And by the way I pray you to impart Both which, and what those other flowers be, Whereof (they say) the Apollo praeses luminis.

Thou hast long liu'd ( Damaetas ) in the woods, And there for Woodman hast Genista serued, To prune her plants, and saue her tender buds, As seasons did the charge to thee commend: And many of her vertues hast obserued, Which vse, or common mought apprehend, But for to deem the doubt thou stick'st vpon. Would aske some time bestow'd in Helicon. 7 When first I went those sacred wells to see, My will to good was harsh, benumm'd and cold: My head now white, was then like eben-tree Dy'de in the sensuall sumes of youthfull will. Loe now of each the contraries I hold, For Time, and trauaile, and those springs of skill Capitis niues: sic Horatius. Of frost, and snow haue made my sculls attire, And warm'd my spirits with their holy fire. 8 Now of these flames I will impart to thee, And happily perhaps thou hast refer'd The resolution of this doubt to me: For why this case was argued long-agone, In Helicon, and I my selfe it heard, Where Phoeb (amid the Muses) on his throne, Establish'd by those sacred maides aduise, The Italians, French, and Spaniards write the first syllable of Garland with an i. & that is neerest to the Etyemologie of Guir & dalen 1: greene leaues in British. What Ghirlands should be ech acchiuements price. 9 The question grew because Apollos suite, Praeferd a plant against such as praesumed To weare a garland of his holy fruite, Without desert or speciall grace diuine. Apollo was much mou'd, and chaf'd, and fumed, And went anone to counsaile with the Nine. And when he had a leafe of Laurell eat, Hinc vates olim olim dicti Lycophron ap. Caelium. Rodig.

Receiv'd a crowne of Mirtle for his hire. 12 I meane whose amorous flame is fed by grace, By grace of hir, who doth his deare perseuer.
