parliament to punish or repress each detriment press grievance or abuse of commonweal but what my suffering must to thou reveal then here they be and ponder they I pray thou and let not these my just complaint dismay thou but rather cause amend they and redress these gross enormity which i will express true and most true it be the abuse of the commoun (@) my chief health consist dread sir most in the commonwealth which ah alas have never heretofore be sound pitch less ground and far more disdainful cast off for who be they that ever strive a Commonn course to sway there be no providence nor public good graft in my bosom my town be denude of policy and venture man please themselves and care not though my fortune split on shelf have I not flood and sea good ship and port brave seaman pilot skipper and consort but where be the Merchand that will free enter to put these man to work and bide the venture of doubtful success nay there be none I see that now dare hazard further than his eye yet man not bear to please himself alone that be idolatrize love to one but total for GOD partly for friend partly for country last for his own end as for my trade they be ruine with decay there few or none employ my noble play the curious courtesan that will not be but in strange fashion o what novelty be this that London rob i of my gain whilst both my trade and merchand suffer pain nay I must say there be no courtly guise nor toy though frenchify thrice be it in or out of fashion i must have it though neither mean nor honesty will crave it but since they will prove fool yet why shall stranger enjoy the profit from fantastic ranger and not my own there be no nation can compare with my best trade match man for man beside my noble supers^uous post to Court see my gentry too post up post down their state for to undo nay they will mortgage all and to be brief ride up with gold and turn again with grief who better far may stay at home and live and not their mean to lovelesse labour give it grieve i I shall yield they yearly rend whilst vain it in neighbour land be spend b^t (@) (@) and behold the end my land change landlord whilst my youngster spend nay there be a general ruin through my bound which make my side to shiver o what wound by prodigal I get there be not a stroke these spendthrift thrust but bring i in some yoke and thus they take my money all away to spend abroad whilst it shall rather stay for to enrich my bowel and to barter for corn and merchandise in every quarter then post and post again post altogether to bag-shot then to beggary nay and whether to root from earth their memory and name stamp themselves on hippodrome of shame I care not for their fall their land lie still though change from hand to hand from ill to ill and like the weathercock from Airt to airt their local ground be change from pairt to pairt now here be a wedset there be a fly off and here be the prison there be a jaylours scoff in Thom tumbler with his bag and belly to alter tack and rental I must tell thou I pity my poor commoun and their toil make to new upstart and their greed a spoil how can my tenant live how can they thrive how can they grow stand when dead alive slay by oppression extortion debate from laird to laird in their chameleon state the tenant suffer all alas poor soul still pray upon by bankrupt and fool then it be no wonder though my land be poor when now most landlord play the errand whore in shift rent and styles as many time as Lais Corinth strumpet do of crime believe i sir revocation I fear this revocation make many one revoke both state and station my lord they post up daily to thy court and lie there month and year and do resor^ to London as their live lay and land in midst of cheapsyde Kingstreete or the strand my gentry too and knight and oft commissioner in this repent excess turn practitioner still up and down they make a play of post and laugh at lavish expense fall a boast who of^est court thy court whilst here at

their purse I grant their tongue can make my gallant spend and suck they dry till all come to a end and why cause in a rodomunto they play the Orlando Furioso aye as well in humour as in lavish charge which make most female wear such skar-clift targe where deep stroke in struggle force be give till both man rib and rig be backward drive whilst the defendant swallow up such mean as reaper do that both cut down and glean then in a word its glutttonie and lust that bring so many headlong to the dust for now at every startle peevish thing Jack Thome and Robin post up to the king and will not to thy counsel judgement stand place here as light the sword of thy right hand to judge if judge judge aright or not and may declare on each sinistruous spot which by thyself be do and set a sunder the counsel place above the judge under but sir I humble beg it be well do to punish these distraction out of tune and send they back to censure be and stand submissive to the justice of this land else they will vex thou and such custom bring that woman too will post up to the King then let a act be make in my regard that neither lord nor earl knight nor laird shall post more up to London but remain at home and spend their rent where grow their grain and to succumb themselves and their debate unto the lord and pillar of my state for which as duty owe they be bund post shall cease and justice here be fund nay I dare say since thy late father death his burial and his funeral in faith there million two of gold from i transport and spend at London where my gallant sport and leave at home GOD know

dissemble where be these late past day the decay of good house keep when Mars surviue and noble keep good house servand live well horse well arm well love well clothe well feed and when my lord with such like troop be clad o there be plenty and abundance too of every thing that nature have to do then laird keep court and every lord at home live like a prince or cardinal of Rome yea and contract no debt mortgage no land but wear the cloth their wife wrought with their hand and now where kitchins smoakd good cheer have be there be cold and hunger and bare wall now see the reason why their sin procure God wrath and bring destruction on themselves with death how many ruine tower and waste fall wall stand nameless now few know their style and call here stand castle blood and their castle pride yonder castle oppression and lust beside here castle gluttony there castle oath here castle Falshood incest that never loathe of castle perjury and lower down s^ands desolation in a thread bare gown and now though most stand nameless and unknown yet by these verdict may their style be show all which though modern some I have as fast ride post to nothing and can roar waist now coach the vanity of prodigal cuntbotche lust and play and vain apparel rot their rent away in stead of serve man they now keep lad to fetch they brow-laced whore wrap up in plad else boy-posting news to go prepare room for his master short will be there where when abroad this gallant ride alone with Jack his lackey near he trot on either to limbo in the brothell-house else to the tavern for a deep carouse where straight to card and dice he fly'th amain and for advantage leave the house his gain so so their score of chaulder and their Bolles be bring from mountain down to little mole they have no deadly feud that be go of late but they be at deadly feud with their own state and care not for ally blood wife nor friend kindred nor bairne save their own waste end who riggs speak english and their salt fur forget scot can speak with gild spur so lawyer seize on part lawyer and right it stand for lawless laird to have law-byding land and will the writer too can find like flash but now the pen on paper seldom dash it we strange the tongue shall gain more than the pen and plead better pay then painful man there be here a labyrinth i will not come in and for to be obsequious be a sin but here I vow they be happy thrice and blessed who least frequent they live at home in rest then laird and lawyer scrivener flock together they be blind that run a course they know not whether ah what make now my country look so bare thus void of plant the want of plant wood and forest fair hedges and ditch park and close ground tree strip and shaw in many fertile bound but only that the landlord set their land from year to year and so from hand to hand they change and flit their tenant as they please and will not give they lease take time nor ease to prosper and to thryve for if they shall as soon they thrust they out of house and hold and he who bid most farm still get the room whilst one above another head do come or else to raise his rent or kiss the door this be the cause my commons live so poor and so the peasant can not set nor plant wood tree and orchard which my valley want but leave i half deform so they be distress and by their greedy master still oppress then now to succour this the only way be that their farm be bring to penny pay and leass let at large for year or lyve fail the husband to their live wyve to heyer or friend and when their tack decline to be renew again pay their fine and yearly money then the lord or laird he need not of a doubtful year regard so England and Ireland all Europe bring to lease and penny-rent but victual nought then may poor tenant thryve set build and plant and be relieve with that which now they want and till such time this land can never be bring from the jaw of wilful poverty as for my tithe which noble most recoil it be another grievance the wrong fall use of tithe to my soil shall tithe belong to laic shall church rend be give to temporal lord by God intent tithe be for levit not for Haulks nor hound nor no reward of sycophant sound tithe may be call god rend and they pertain still to his priest his service to maintain the very turk and mahometan ley allot their daruish religious feye yea savage sabunck of Lybia the odd as tithe they dote to serve their garlic God then how much more shall truth to mean be place when brutish ignorant be so embrace nay more than clergy tithe shall too sustain my seminary school with yearly grain my college decay they have no rent more than the scholar bring for board mean thus learning go to ruin book grow scant mean they have none and maintenance they want there be no gain nor no preferment neither now follow learning nor desert but rather the great dunsse if rich be soon place and rare scholar lack mean deface thus airt grow airtle wit repine wit when ass must in lion cabin sit tithe too shall build blessed hospital and do erect school bridge and sustain they too but where they shall do good they do most ill be abuse by use and corrupt will for sir take heed what grief be this and cross to my poor commoun and a yearly loss that when their corn be shear stoukd dead and dry they can not get they teinded nay and why some grudge or malice move despite to wound the hopeful harvest and rot their corn on ground this be no rare thing on their stowk that see snow-coverd top below they be grass-growne green which often breed great famine and great scant and plague my commoun with a heart-broke want for which they grieve in this long deformation and hope to have from thou a reformation which GOD may grant and bless thy judgement too for to what oppressor do so so reclaim they deal they at thy pleasure for GOD and godliness and for thy treasure which be in thy hand and then to farm they back on lord will bread a double harm for worse and worse my commoun shall be cross and all thy good intention therein lose then let my tithe be bring to money rend for thou from landlord and the poor tennent so may they shear and lead and stakke their corn at midnight midday afternoon or morn which shall be their advantage and my gain when Barnes and yard be fill with timely grain I have some sycophant lie at thy court disturber of my peace and there resort still hatch of mischief project end which to my country ruin only tend and though they burrowd life land birth and blood of i they be still repay ill for good for have spend their mean so now their brain they spend in forge of seditious strain still this or that devyse run such course that for their cross they be repay with curse nay I must call they bandit rebel breed and fugitive from poena flee then then dread sir take heed such snake may sting and wound the judgement of a prudent King as for this valuation who can tell valuation what be mean thereby or can my preacher well with one out of each parish lay the ground what every land be worth or may be find no no its labour lose and I pray God we be not scourge for it by his just rod a lesser fault than this make Israel quake when David of his people count will make but value stock and brock tithe fruit and all God must give increase the vicissitude of by or the reckon fall so time untimely have their time misspend on base ingratitude and bounty shend what be worth without wealth merit without love birth without virtue greatness without jove Bairnes without duty parent without care friend without credit town without repair life without learning servant without pain faith without good work commerce without gain hope without repentance wit without reason grief without patience mirth out of season command

clark without decreet lawyer without plea tillage without soil traffic without peace grace without godliness sheep without fleece pride without puissance love unless acquent wyve without child wealth without content all which be toil lose labour lose in vain and drudge care for profit without gain discordant thing still contrary end oppose the cause not the effect we shall suppose so fate agree so accident and climb conclude this age must see such woeful time so grammar school be ruynd the decay of school learn rare board be so dear and stipend wax so bare that good house-houlders countryman I spy can hardly board their Bairnes abroad and why broughs be so finger schoolmaster so needy lore at such rate and victualler so greedy that now most Bairnes with sheep and plough be find which make so many ignorant abound with rustic carriage manner harsh and rude and decent comeliness be quite seclude for what make nature civil mild and meek kind wise affable gentle slow to speak but good education well breed well teach in moral precept and divyne fraught with learned wisdom whence discretion flow and understanding too for learning grow to be the light of nature and I find it be the ornament of a pregnant mind and though it be but for to read and write it be a needful use and yield delight to every good conception give direction to know aright and so serve for correction and thus the ruther which behaviour rule though graft in nature be refynd by school so will to god. in time a course be take that school and scholar be repayrd again another great abuse be this that when man run in suretyship for other man or else morgadgd in debt yet will not pay their creditor nor thy just law obey but scorn horn caption rebel turn and in despite of power all where sojourn arm with rebellion pistol sword and dagger threaten to kill they roar it out and swagger they boast their creditor and plague the poor even ramble through best town from door to door whilst neither shrieve nor justice will lay hold upon these rebel nay although they can they will not why some one respect or other dry^e in de^ayes whilst they thy law down smother and thus this land be over run and cross with lawless bankrupt and justice lose some new break as civil cheater do guard Barwick bankrupt and make Barw^ck guard they too it sti^l keep garrison all man may see in stead of soldier now flee spendthrift be this border town like to that seat of Rome from sword and spoil to cozenage be come the one absolve sin the other debt though neither can nor can such freedom get nay Barwick jump with Rome in more than this slaughter adultery incest what be amiss in civil law or church it will protect they though justice vengeance cry sin detect they then who shall curb this shelter or restrain it but thou against who the dishonest abuse of fugitive mattage and thy law they maintain it there be too of late a new eclipse miscaryage but rather one abuse of honest marriage for now young person fauncye other love without consent of parent thus it prove or of their pastor approbation neither of town nor parish nay of friend or father away they go to England there they be marry and sometime too like party turn miscary where fail of church rite this yoke they draw that lawless love may be make loveles Law for if the english priest be not palmestrat he will not marry they turn ambodextrat how can like nuptials stand and stand with reason although the priest conjoin they o what treason of fugitive be this to see when my own brood from my kind bowel flee from parent love from lawful pastor power for to be match by stealth and will devour religion into shame whilst thou base priest turn back from be preacher to a beast what can thou say if such incestuous be else vild ad^ltrers brand with infamy or else betrothd to other at which time perhaps liable to some criminal crime and dare thou brand thyself and marriage stain for one poor piece of gold for three or twain nay as by unlawfulness they come to it even as unlawful be thou call to do it o prelate then and judge of this land which both for church and state shall just stand away with this o let such nuptial be hold as injust conceal woney and punish rigrous now for conceal money I dare protest the search of they breed a commoun pest the Purcifant he go abroad to summon Thome Will and Dick the hear scarce worth a dunmond this ambodextrat villain he warn all before the exchequer and if they fail a penalty ensue else fill his hand or go for Edinburgh where come they stand wai^iag and wait to be try and hear the Messinger he come not they be debar from audience and dismissd and thus they be cross with pain great charge and their labour lose then judge great sir and you my judge judge if this and like wrack not the plough drudge for chamberlave bailie and laird court clerk I see the project of their subtle wark the first they fat themselves by greed by stealth and out of ruin work their mine of wealth bring most lord to nought else in such debt that they be not able out of it to get the bailie oft make crooked the right cause take from both faction bribe with false forge clause will have call truth if not the bailie will make the plaintives part a double Faillie the clark exact on all they will have feye pay and repay for act although but ley then help these fault you earl lord and knight and let domestic servant rule your right yea serious be yourselves to ta^e a count of all your duty as your father wont so shall your state and rent increase and stand and poor oppress one free from factor hand as for my cow and cattle they be transport and sheep transport of cattle with gallowedian nage consort to all the english quarter here and there lea^ing my field half destitute and bare of their wont plenty and abundance great of all kind bestial that content can get but see this drove and this carye out make flesh both scarce and dear all where about that now few house great or small
