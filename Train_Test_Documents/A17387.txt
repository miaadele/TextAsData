By Nicolas Bifeild preacher of Gods word at Isleworth in Middlesex. Byfield, Nicholas, 1579-1622. The second edition. The Preface. T HESE directions for reading the SCRIPTVRES containe three things. First Analyticall ta∣bles, concerning the order of the whole SCRIPTVRES, and the seuerall bookes and Chapters gathered to this end, that the Reader might before hee reads, marke the drift of each booke and Chap∣ter, and when hee hath read, might with singular ease and delight remember, what hee hath read. The second is a Calendar, shewing what num∣ber of chapters are to be read e∣uery day, that so the whole Bi∣ble might bee read ouer in a yeere. The number of Chapters, while you are reading the olde Testament is for the most part three a day, and when you come to the new Testament, it is but two: Sometimes where the matter is Historicall, or Typicall, or the chapters short, I haue set downe a greater number. The third thing is the Rules for obseruation of profitable things in reading. Many complaine of their not profiting in reading, and some weake Christians afflict their hearts maruellously with griefe and feare, because they cannot read with more comfort and profit, when the fault is not in their affection to the word, so much as in their want of dire∣ction for their reading. Concerning these Rules I consider both the matter, and the maner of vsing them. For the matter, hee that comes to read the Scriptures, should espe∣cially set himselfe to obserue two things: First the most needfull places to enlarge his owne knowledge, and further his owne growth in the true grace of God. Secondly such places, as might warrant his practise in the things, the world vsually cauills at and reproch∣eth his profession for: as if hee did not what were necessary to doe. There are some things in all places obiected against the godly. Now it is a thing of ad∣mirable vse in our reading to gather vnder the seuerall heads such places, as may establish our hearts with abundance of assu∣rance, that we do nothing out of precisenesse and curiositie in those things: but meerly at the commandement of God. And the Scriptures are so apparant, and easie to bee discerned, and so many in number, that the simplest Reader may gather great store of testimonies. Now for the first of these, that is, such places as might most profit me in my particuler rea∣ding: I would bring this minde to the Scriptures. (I will but giue a tast here.) First it were a thing of ad∣mirable vse all my life long, if I did set downe all the places of Scripture, that in the reading I finde sensible comfort and ra∣uishing of heart in: It may be in the whole Bible I may finde 20. 40. 50. &c. of such places, as I was sure in the reading did wonderfully fill my heart with secret refreshing, and sensible ioy: Now these places so noted, not onely serue for present vse, but while I liue, in any distresse, I may haue recourse to these, as so many wells of ioy, and if in my griefe one, or two, or tenne of them did not comfort mee: yet a thousand to one some of them will haue spirit and life in them to refresh me againe in a∣ny sorrowes: Besides, it mar∣uellously establisheth my faith, when I remember, in how ma∣ny distinct places of Scripture the Lord was pleased to com∣fort me in particular. This is one thing now wee should ob∣serue. Secondly would it not be ex∣ceeding profitable; If I did note all the places of scripture which in reading of them did sensibly smite my heart, and reprooue some fault in mee, so as I felt my heart troubled within mee? Certainely by that time I had gone through the Scriptures, I should see the Anatomy of my corruptions, and plainely per∣ceiue, what things there were in my nature, that God had a quar∣rell against: and so might bee guided by the very finger of God to know the faults, I should set my selfe most against in mor∣tification. Thirdly, in reading one shall finde sometimes certaine rules or counsells giuen, which one sensibly is affected withall, and hath an inward desire, Oh that I could but remember this counsell of the holy Ghost, Now I would note all those pla∣ces, that the holy Ghost made me in loue withall in the rea∣ding, that might concerne my own particular direction either at home, or abroad. Againe, the most people in the midst of these extreame dif∣ferences of opinions on all sides, feele sometimes a wonderfull desire, such as this, O that I could tell but some certaine way what to beleeue, and then let all the world contend, if they will: Now for this I would marke all those apparant places, that containe euident ground of truth, against which there can be in my conscience no cauill, but I could liue and die in the assurance, that that is the wil of God. It is incredible, how the simplest may settle themselues herein, in all the fundamentall points of religion. If thou finde of these but 20. 30. 40. or 50. places in the whole Bible; thou canst not now beleeue, how it will settle thee: As for exam∣ple, 1. Ioh. 5. he faith, There are three in heauen, the Fa∣ther, the Word, and the Spi∣rit, and these three are one. All the world now should neuer make me doubt of the Trinitie in vnitie. When I had gotten those grounds, those I would sticke to , and for other questi∣ons, let them wrangle while they will, I would receiue fur∣ther light when I saw it cleere, but their quarrelling should not much trouble me. And thus I might go on with the particu∣lars of the first sort of rules, but these shall suffice to giue light to the course. Now for the second sort of Rules one may finde in euery place certaine things, strongly obiected against the practise of the godly: As for example, that they deserue to bee hated, be∣cause they will not keepe compa∣ny with their neighbours, and because they stand so precisely vpon small matters, as lesser othes, and doing slight workes vpon the sabbath day, and such like: and besides, many men are afraide to enter vpon such a course of life, because it is a way so euill spoken of, and reproched in the world &c. Now for my owne establishment I would marke, where my course differ∣ed from other men, and in rea∣ding I would gather euident places, that might warrant my practise: As for example, pla∣ces that iustifie the auoiding of the company of the wicked, and so againe places, that shew, that the sincere practise of godlines hath beene euer liable to the scornes, reproches, and slaun∣ders of the world. And so of the rest. Now for the maner of vsing these rules, I thinke, thou maist profitably follow these directi∣ons. First make thee a little paper booke of a sheete or two of paper, as may be most porta∣ble: then write vpon the toppe of euery leafe the title for that that thou wouldest obserue in reading. Chuse out only six or eight titles out of the whole number of such at for the pre∣sent thou hast most neede to ob∣serue: or onely so many as thou art sure thy memory will easily cary to thy reading, whether more or fewer. In reading obserue onely such places as stare thee in the face, that are so euident, thy heart cannot looke of them. Trouble not thy selfe with that obiection, that there are many things which thou canst not discerne, take thou onely such as thou canst not passe ouer, they are so cleare and euident. In noting the pla∣ces, set downe vnder each title only the booke, Chapter, and verse, and not the words, for that will tire thee in the end: As for example, would I ob∣serue all the hard places, which in reading I haue a desire to know the meaning of, that so when I come into the company of Preachers or able Christians, I might haue profitable questi∣ons to propound: I would set it downe thus, Hard places, Malach. 4. 5. Malach. 2. 6. And so of other places: for I giue these on the suddaine but for instance sake. Now when thou hast done thy quarters taske, or thy yeeres taske, then thou maist write out the th isest things, as thou thinkest good, and in the meane time hast the vse of the places for turning to. And if thou shouldest in reading, of thy selfe remember some title, which thou hast not in this direction, and yet hast a great desire to obserue places of that kinde, by any meanes write it downe, whilest thou thinkest of it, and custome in obseruing will make thee able to bee thine owne Di∣rectour hereafter. Looke not at the profit of this course the first weeke, or month: but con∣sider, how rich it will make thee at the yeeres end. I am perswaded, if thou feare God, thou wouldst not sell thy collec∣tions for a great price, after thou hast gathered them, if it were but for the good, they may doe thee in the euill day, when it shall come vpon thee. Farewell, the Lord giue thee a blessing, and pray thou for mee, and remember before thou read to lift vp thy heart to God in some short eiaculati∣ons, to beg his blessed assistance, and take heede thou be not vn∣thankefull to God for the suc∣cesse. By all meanes striue to keeepe a delight in thy course, and let not thy heart bee too apt to dis∣couragement: but reioyce in the Lord. Againe farewell: the Lord keep thee till the day of Christ. The order of the Bookes, and of reading the whole SCRIPTVRES. T He Booke you are to read is the Bible: your Bible is diui∣ded into 2: parts, the old Testament, and the New.
