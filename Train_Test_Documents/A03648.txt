Chap. I. Of the Distinction of Creatures, and their respondency to the World.
THE euerlasting God, as infinite in wisdome, as incomprehensible in power, the only builder and maker of this wonderfull and glorious frame of the World, hath likewise (by his most diuine knowledge) created, and suffered man to perceiue three orders of creatures, all differing in themselues; which are corporall, as the Clements; spirituall, as Angels; and compound, as Man: And these corporall bodies are subdiuided into bright and shining bodies, as Planets and Starres, or into opacious and grosse bodies, as the earth and mettals, or into diaphane and transparent bodies, as aire and water; Or these kind of bodies some haue being onely, as Stones; some, life and being, as Trees; some, sense, life and being, as Beasts; and others, vnderstanding, sense, life, and being, as Man, which is most noble of all other; and therefore the Philosophers haue called him Microcosmus, a little World, which doth respond vnto the greater: for as the
motion of the whole glove is caused by the voluntary motion of an intellectuall substance (which some call Daemones, or Intelligentiae) so man is moued by his intellectiue soule, because as Aristotle hath proued: Euery thing that is moued, is moued by the vertue of another. And as this most wonderfull frame or Machina doth containe all things in it selfe, because Extra coelum nihil est: so man by knowledge is all, and at all nothing natural is hid from him, being not without motions and affectations equall to that glorious and heauenly Hierarchie. And to end this respondency betwixt Microcosmus and Cosmus, betwixt Man and the World, in man are two motions, intellectuall and sensuall, the one to good, the other to bad, so in the world are two locall motions, rationall and irrationall, the one into the West, the other into ye East: for as the irrationall motion is contrary to the rationall; so is the intellectuall to the sensuall. Man thus resembling the heauens, became a Christian, taking the denomination thereof from Christ; Iesus being the proper name, and Christ the surname; Iesus being the name of his God-head and diuinity, and Christ the name of his office and dignity: Iesus in Greeke being called Sother, in Latine Saluator; in English both signifying a Sauiour; and in conclusion, note from S. Bernard 4 creations of man: The first without man and woman, as Adam out of the earth: The second of man without woman, as Euah, of Adams rib: the third of man and woman, as we are: and the 4 of a virgin, without man, as Christ of Mary.



CHAP. II. The definition of the World.
THe world is Heauen and Earth, and all things therein contained as well simple as mixt, and (as Moses testifies) was made by God. The Latines call it Mundus a mouendo, because it is in continuall motion; it is called of the Greekes Cosmus, a pulchritudo, because it is most faire and beautifull, as well by reason of the Elements, and such transparent bodies, as by reason of the resplendency of the Sunne, Moone, and Starres: for indeede what is more admirable to behold: which caused Plato to say, eyes were giuen to man to view the glory of heauen, as may also appeare by Ouid.

Os hominum sublime dedit, coelumque videre.

For what is a more sure testimony of the wonderfull workes of God, or what greater delight is there (to them that truly vnderstand it) then the beholding of the glory of the Sunne, Moone, and Starres, in obseruing their motions vpon their Excentrickes, and Concentricks, in noting the diuersity of aspect and radiations, with their retrogradations and directions, their magnitudes and distances, and such like. As for the name of heauen, it is called with the Latines Coelum, quia coelatum est, pictatum and ornatum.



CHAP. III. Of the diuision of the World.
THe world is diuided into two parts or regions, Elementary and Aethereall: The Elementary part is subiect vnto daily alteration, and doth containe the Fire, Aire, Water, and Earth. The Aethereall region doth containe in his concauity, the Elementary region, and this Aethereall region is called of some, Quinta essentia, the quint-essence, or fist substance, which is a body of it selfe, differing from all Elements, and things Elementall, as well in matter as in forme, and no lesse in nature and quality, containing no contrariety, and being without corruption; such is heauen, and the matter thereof, but the Elements are farre of otherwise, not simple, but compounded of viscotions matter: for a pure Element cannot be seene, because that which is pure wanteth colour, and that which wanteth colour is not visible, and therefore the Elements intermingle themselues according to their propinquity, so that an Element is that whereof any thing is compounded: they are the first of compositions, yet of themselues not compounded: for they bee imagined simple bodies in respect of other bodies, compound and mixt of these Elements; euery part taketh name of the whole, as euery part of water, is water; and euery part of fire, is fire: They be diuisible into parts of diuers formes, and of the commixion of them is made and ingendred
diuers things of sundry kinds, as well things vegitatiue, as sensitiue, rationall or irrationall, and euery of these Elements hath and nourisheth therein liuing creatures, as the Salamander in our fire, which is but an imperfect element, because it is mixt with viscotious and earthy matter: the Camelion in the aire, which there also liueth, and Birds which there abide: the fish in the water, Moles and wormes in the earth, and man and beast vpon the earth: and you must know, that euery body compounded of the foure Elements, is elementary, not that they be Elements formerly, but vertually in mixt bodies.


CHAP. IIII. Of the Elementall part of the World.
IN the Elementall part of the world is contained the earth, the water, aire, and fire, the superficiall conuexity of euery one of these resting in the superficiall concauity of the next superiour Element; and therefore the earth hangeth in the concauity of the water; the water, in the concauity of the aire, and the aire in the concauity of the fire:euen as you see the scales of onions one inclosed in another. Now for the earth, it is a round body like vnto a ball, darke and solid without any concauity, hanging by the prouidence of God, fixed in the middest of the world, insomuch that if you were in any other part of the earth, you should be no neerer vnto ye heauens then you are in England; which moued ye Philosophers
to say: Stellae aequae distare a centro terrae, siue in Oriente, siue in Occidente, etc. And the Earth (as you shall perceiue hereafter) is but a point in respect of the Heauens, and is by nature cold and dry. Next aboue the earth is the water, the earth hanging in the concauity thereof, they both indeed making but one round globe, as may appeare by the eclypse of the Moone, the seas being bounded and limited by the earth, as may appeare by Psal. 107, and Iob. 38. the water is of nature cold and moist, in compassing the superficiall conuexity whereof is the aire, and is diuided into three regions, the inferiour, superiour, and meane; the inferiour is warme by reason of the reflection of the Sunne beames reuerberated and beateu backe by the earth: the superiour is hote by occasion of the proximity of the fire, and there Comets and fiery Meteors are ingendred; the meane is coldest, as well by the remotenesse of the fiery region, as also for that the reflection and reuerberation of the sunne beames cannot extend so farre, and here all watery meteors are created, as snow and such like: but the Element of aire of it selfe is warme and moist, hanging in the concauity of the fire, which is hote and dry, so that each Element hath qualities of the other by participation as the aire doth participate with the fire in warmnesse, with the water in moistnesse, the earth with the water in coldnesse, and with the fire in drinesse, so that two elements be extreamely contrary, as the fire, warme and dry, is contrary to the water, cold and moist; and the aire warme
and most is contrary to the earth cold and dry, so that there is in euery Element but one predominating quality, called the qualitie passiue, because they be contrary amongst themselues and cannot consist in euery Element, as the fire exceedeth in heate, the aire in moistnesse, coldnesse in the water, and drynesse in the earth; and what other qualities they haue, commeth by participation: of the material vertue, and natural commixtion of which Element, all bodies perfect and vnperfect (which are bodies mixt) are ingendred: For you must know, that there is nothing in the world, but is compounded hereof as stones take most of the nature of the earth, mettals of the slimy nature of the water, plants, hearbs, and all liuing things take most of the aire, and yet all these haue part of the fire, and therefore some stones, as lime-stones and thunder-bolts, take most of the fire, other stones more of the water then earth, as Christall, Birrell, and Pearles, and other participate more of the aire then earth, as such that will not sinke, and so amongst mettals, some participate more of one element then of another: as lead and siluer of the earth; quicke-siluer of ye water; copper of the aire; and iron and gold of ye fire: so may it be said of hearbs and plants, the roots by their thicknesse participating most of the earth; the leaues by their moistnesse, of water; the blossomes for their lightnesse, of the aire; and the seede by reason of the generatiue spirit, of the fire: so do all beasts participate more of one Element then another, as is said before: albeit some parts of them participate of the
other Elements, as bones of the earth, flesh of the aire, the spirit vitall of the fire, and the humour of the water. Likewise the senses of man bee attributed vnto the foure Elements, as the vnderstanding to the fire, the reason to the aire, the imagination to the water, and feeling to the earth. The like is of the outward senses, the sight is appropriated to the fire, for light is not without fire; the hearing to the aire, as caused by the reuerberation thereof; the smell to the water: for no smell is without moisture; and the touching to the earth. So be the acts of the body, and passions of the mind attributed to the elements; as mouing slowly, to the earth: feare and sorrow, to the water: ioy, grace and maintenance, to the aire: anger, fury and vnrest, to the fire, Let this suffice, lest I be tedious.


CHAP. V. Of the Aethereall or Coelestiall part of the World.
THe celestiall part of the world, called of some the Aethereal Region, or Quinta essentia, encompasseth and containeth in the concauity thereof, all the Elementall Region. And this celestiall part hath in it ye seuen Planets, and their spheares, the starry Firmament, the Christalline Heauen, the First Mouer, and the Emperiall Heauen, as shall follow.

Of the first Heauen.

The Philosophers had no knowledge of this
Emperiall Heauen: onely the Scriptures teach vs to beleiue the saine; and is called the Emperiall Heauen, by reason of the clearenesse and resplendency: It is immoueable, made by God, the first day he began his creation of the world, and by him immediatly replenished with his ministers, the holy Angels: It is the foundation of ye world. most fine and pure in substance, most round in shape, most great in quantity, most cleare in quality, and most high in place, where (as it is thought) remaineth the humanity of Jesus Christ, and hath therein three Hierarchias, holy orders, or principalities, called: Epiphonia, Epiphonomia, and Euphumia; and these are called of some, Supercoelestiall, Coelestiall, and Subcoelestiall. Now the first hath in it three orders, as Seraphins, Cherubins, and Thrones: The first excelling in zealous loue, the second in knowledge, and the third in iustice. Epiphonomia hath likewise three orders, as Principalities, teaching inferiours duty to their superiours: Powers, chasing away euill spirits, comforting such as fight in ghostly battell; and Dominations, teaching men how to behaue themselues in spirituall conflicts. Lastly, Euphumia or Subcoelestiall hath also vnder it three lower orders, as Vertues for comforters, Archangels, shewing miracles, and Angels working miracles: to conclude, here is the aboundance of all goodnesse, and perfect felicity with the priuation of euill.



CHAP. VI. Of the first Moueable.
VNder the Emperiall Heauen, is situate the First Moueable, called Primum Mobile, containing all other inferiour Spheares, and by his naturall motion moueth from East to West, and to the East againe in foure and twenty houres, and by violence of this motion carrieth with him all the inferiour Spheares, contrary to their proper motion, which is to the East; and many Philosophers thinke, that if this motion were not flackened by the contrary course of the inferiour Spheares, that the frame of Heauen and Earth would be torne in peeces, and nothing prosper or remaine, by reason of the violence thereof: This Heauen is puce and cleare without starres.


CHAP. VII. Of the Christalline Heauen.
THe Christalline Heauen is also a cleare substance, void of Starres, not subiect to the sight, perlucid, transparent, and most slow in motion, mouing (according to the succession of the signes) one degree in 100 yeares, and accomplishing a full reuolution in 36000 yeares, but according to Alfonsus, in 49000 yeares. The reason why this heaue^ doth require so long a time, is because of the neernesse thereof to the first Moueable, which turneth this heauen and the rest about
with him by a contrary motion, as is said, and therefore the nearer any Spheare is to the first Mouer, the longer is he in accomplishing his revolution: This reuolution of some is called Mag^nus annus Platonis, because when it was compleat he thought all things should returne to the estate they were at first. This Heauen is called of some the watery Heauen, by the authority of Scriptures, Gen. chap. 1. and in the Psalmes: All the waters aboue the firmament, etc.


CHAP. VIII. Of the Starry Heauen.
THis Firmament is a most glorious heauen adorned and beautified with all the fixed starres, whose naturall motion is vpon two little circles, the one about the head of Aries, the other of Libra, whose diameters is 4 deg. 18 min. and 43 sec. and is called the motion of Trepidation; but indeed ye motion of this heauen is three-fold: for first it turneth about from East to West in foure and twenty houres, according to the diurnall motion: Next it moueth from West to East according to the 9 Heauen, and is called the motion of the Auges of the fixed starres; which Auges are points limiting the greatest distance of any Spheare from the center of the world. The last is made by vertue of his owne proper motion, as sometimes towards the South, and other times into the North, which is called Motus trepidationis, as is said: this Spheare maketh his whole reuolution
in 7000 yeares, and this motion somes time is called Motus, accessus, and recessus, onely proper to the 8 Spheare, and in this spheare or heauen is the Zodiacke, and all the rest of the circles in the materiall spheare imagined to bee: And this 8 spheare, according to Albateginus is distant from the earth 19000 semidiameters.


CHAP. IX. The course, colour, placing, magnitude, and distance of the seuen Planets, with the thicknesse of their Spheares.
VNder and within the concauity of the starry Heauen is placed the Orbe and Spheare of Saturne, and so the rest successiuely, which are known by their colour and magnitude: and if any one require to know why these spheares (being so many) are not subiect to sight, but seeme as one intire body: the reason is, for that they be Bodies perspicuous, cleare and transparent. But to proceed.
Saturne mouing vnder the 8 spheare, is of a pale leaden colour, requiring 30 yeares to passe through the Zodiacke, and is bigger then the earth 95 times, Albateginus saith but 79. Alfraganus saith 91. their diameters being as 9 to 2; and is distant fro^ the earth 15800 semidiameters, but as Tycho Brache saith, 10550 semidiameters, and as the vulgar say, 237978 miles and a halfe, Saturne being from the firmament 120485 miles, so that the heauen of Saturne must containe in thicknesse 196044546/11 miles, otherwise it could
not containe his starre.
Iupiter is next vnder Saturne, faire and bright, ending his reuolution in 12. yeares: according to Albateginus he appeareth as the 12. part of the Sunne, and therefore is bigger then the earth 81 times, Alfrag. saith 95. others 91. their diameters being as 32. to 7. he is distant from the earth 10423. semidiameters, but wc the vulgar 159357@ miles, whose heauen containes in thickenesse 18996546/11 miles, and is below Saturne 78721. miles.
Mars, within the concauity of the spheare of Iupiter, appeares of a fiery colour, running his course in 2. yeares, appearing as the 20, part of the Sunne, and therefore doth containe the whole magnitude of the earth once, and as Albateg. saith, a third part more: some say once and ten sixteenes, others would haue it twice, which is false: so that their diameters are as 7. to 6. Alfraganus puts Mars and the earth in a Sesquialter proportion, with an 8. part ouer, which is once and a halfe, and one 8. part. Mars is distant from the earth 4584. fere semidiameters: but as the vulgar haue said 80536@ miles, and his spheare is in thicknesse 26308800. miles, and is vnder Iupiter 78721. miles.
The Sunne is placed in ye middle of the planets, most cleare and bright, the well-spring of pure light oculus mundi, anima and cor coeli, finishing his reuolution euery yeare, delighting (as a Giant) to run his course. And according to Ptolomeus Albateginus, and Alfraganus, he is 166@ times bigger
then the earth, so that their diameters beaye proportion, as 11 to 2. But Copernicus will haue the Sunne to be but 162 fere more then the earth: so that their diameters areas 5 P. 27. M. to one. According to the first account, the Sunne is distant hence, 1150 Semidiameters; but with the later, 1142 semidiameters; and as the vulgar say, it is from the earth to Sol 64811@ miles, his Heauen containing in thicknesse, 343996 4/11 miles: hee being below Mars, 15725 miles.
Venus, vnder the spheare of the Sunne, doth appeare very cleare and shining; not three yeares past, being the Euening starre, she was taken of many at first for a Comet: for indeed shee is brighter then Iupiter; ending her reuolution as the Sunne, from whom shee cannot depart more then 48 degrees: so that going before the sunne, she is called the Morning Starre, and following the sunne, the Euening Starre: she appeareth as the 10 part of Sols diameter, and therefore is lesser then the earth 36 times, their diameters being as 10 to 3. Alfraganus would haue the earth 28 times more then Venus, others 39, others 37. Tycho saith, 6@ times: she is from the earth 618 semidiameters, and as the vulgar say, 41374 miles, lying below the Sunne, 23437@ miles, her Heauen being in thicknesse, 32744946/11 miles.
Mercury, wandring vnder the spheare of Venus, appeareth somewhat shining, but not very bright, being neuer more then 29 degrees
elongated frrom the Sunne, and therefore seldome seene; his diameter sheweth as the 15 part of the Sunnes diameter, whereby wee may gather, that he is lesse then the earth 19000 times: Alfraganus would haue him 22000 at least: others 32000, others 3143 times lesse. But Tycho will haue it but 19 times, and his diameter to be to the diameter of the earth, as 3 to 8. With the vulgar he is distant from the earth 28562 miles, and is below Venus 1282 miles: his Heauen containing in thicknesse, 253372@ miles.
The lowest of all the Planets is the Moone, whose body is encompassed within the spheare of of Mercurie, running ouer the whole Zodiacque in 27 daies, 7 houres, 43 minutes, and neere 6 seconds; she is lesser then the earth 39. times so that the body of the Sunne containes the body of the Moone, 6540 fere. Herewith agreeth Prolemaeus, Albategnius, and Alfraganus: But Copernicus will haue the Moone 4.3 times lesse: so that (where with the former) their diameters bee as 17 to 5, with Copernicus it is as 7 to 2, and therefore the body of the sunne must exceed the body of the Moone 7000; of the vulgar she is said 15750 miles distant from the earth, with Tycho 60 semidiameters, whose heauen containeth 105222 2/33 miles, and is below Mercury 12812 miles.
As touching these distances of the planets, you must know that it is meant when they be in their meane motion, neither in their Apogaeon, or Perigaeon:
for then they be much further off, or farre neerer vnto vs.


CHAP. X Of the magnitude of the Sunne and Moone, and the rest of the Planets, with their diameters, and distances from the Earth, in miles, according to Tycho Brahe: and of the magnitude of the fixed Starres, and other secrets concerning them.
TYcho Brahe, a Dane (as by his workes, and commendations of our soueraigne Lord king Iames may appeare) a diligent obseruer of the celestiall bodies, doth much differ in their diameters, the magnitude of their bodies, and their distance from the earth, from all other ancient writers, as it shall appeare by his demonstration of the sunnes magnitude.
He first obserued by a hollow instrument of 32 foote long, that the greatest apparent diameter of the sunne, being in his Apogaeon, was 30 minutes, in his Perigaeon 32 minutes, and in his meane motion about the Equinoctiall, or a little after, 31 minutes, reiecting vtterly the opinion of Ptolemaeus and Copernicus, that affirme the apparent diameter of the sunne in his Apogaeon, to be 31 minuts, 40 seconds, in Perigaeon neere 34, and in his meane motion 32@ minutes: Likewise for the distance of the sunne from the earth in his meane motion, he reiects Ptolemaeus 1165
semidiameters, as too much, and Copernicus 1142 as too little, and iumps at the meane betwixt both, and so pronou^ceth ye sun in his meane motio^ 1150 semidiameters fro^ ye earth, drawing thereby more neare to a Germane, one Io. Franc. Offus. ye would haue the sunne 576 whole diameters from the earth, which is 1152 semidiameters, hauing thus presupposed his appare^t diameter in his meane motion 31 minuts, and accordingly his distance from the earth 1150 semidiameters: thus hee demonstrates his Corpulencie.
DEC is the body of ye Sun, whose diameter DC maketh the angle DAC 31 M, at A the earth. Now ye distance of the sunne from the earth, is AB 1150 semidiameters: therefore in ye right lined triangle
astronomical diagram of sun and earth
there is giuen two knowne sides containing a knowne angle: (for D A and C A differ not sensibly from A B) so that the third side is P. 1122@ fere, and so many semidiameters of the earth doth the diameter of the sunne containe: therefore his diameter is greater then the earths 5 1/7 4/5 times, by which according to Cubicall numbers, ye body of the Sunne doth exceed the body of the Earth but 139. times, and no more will Tycho allow.
Now the Apparent diameter of the Moone in her meane motion, is 33. minuts, her distance 60 semidiameters: the diameter of the earth containing her diameter 3 2/4 2/9 times, so yt their proportions are as 2 to 7. And thus briefly of these two Planets, whereby it may appeare, that according to Tycho the diameter of the Sunne containes the Moones diameter 18 times, whereby the body of the Moone is lesse then the Sunne, aboue 5848 times: so that the Sunne, neither according to Prolemaeus, doth exceed the Moone more then 6000, nor yet according to Copernicus 7000 times: and in co^clusion, ye Sun in his meane motion is distant from the earth 1150 semidiameters (as is said) in his Apogaeon in Iune, 1190. and in his Perigaeon but 1110 times, as in December.
Now for the rest of the Planets according to Tycho take them thus briefly, lest I bee tedious.
Saturne in his meane motion is from the earth semid. 10550. his apparent diameter is M. 1. S. 5. containing the earths diameter 2 9/^ ^/^ times, bearing
proportion as 31 to 11, exceeding the earth 22 times:
Iupiter is from ye earth 3990. semidiameters, his apparent diameter is M. 2@, and in proportion to the earths diameter, as 12 to 5, exceeding the earth but 14 times.
Mars is distant from the earth 1745 semidiameters, his apparent diameter not all M. 2 wanting about one third part, therefore saith Tycho: Per cubicam numerationem terra aliquanto plus qua^ tredecies Marte maior, that is lesse then the earth 13 times.
The apparent diameter of Venus is 3@ M. her diameter being to the diameter of the earth, as 6 to 11: so that the body of Venus is lesse then the earth 6 times, and @, and distant as the Sun.
Mercury his apparent diameter is 2@ M. which the auncient counted insensible, but Tycho saith, he being remoued something from the Sun appeareth as a Scarre of the first magnitude: his diameter being to the earths diameter, as 6 to 11, the corpulency of the earth exceeding him but 6@ times and is distant as the Sunne.
By that which is said we may conclude for the common capacity, that the Planets be distant in miles according to T. Brahe from the center of the earth, as followeth.


The exact distance of the seuen Planets from the earth, as they be in their meane motion, according to moderne obseruation.

Saturne is from the earth
9073000 miles.




Iupiter,

3431400 miles.



Mars

1500700 miles.



The Sunne

989000 miles.


Venus and Mercury in their meane motion be as the Sunne, to which Copernicus also assenteth.



The Moone.

48760 miles.




Of the fixed Starres.
The number of the fixed Starres, that the Astronomers take notice of, is 1025. But the Portugals haue brought home newes (by their voyages to India) of certaine other constellations and Cloudes neere to the South pole; but those discoueries as yet be not held probable, chiefly for that Ptolemaeus, in respect of the place where hee dwelt, with a little more trauell, might haue found them out, but did not. The starres in number bee not infinite, as some'thinke, as may appeare, Psal. 147. He counteth the number of the Starres, etc. And in Nahum, Chap. 3. ver. 16. Thou hast multiplied thy Merchants aboue the starres of heauen.


Why the Starres seeme fewest in Sommer, and most in Winter.
The reason is, because the predominating cold of the Winter is driuen in Sommer into the middest region of the aire; where (by reason of the Antiperistasis, or circumstance of heate aboue and beneath) the aire is so ingrosed and thickned that our sight cannot pierce through the same, whereby the lesser starres appeare not to ye sight,
whereas in winter the cold breaking forth, and dispersing it selfe, becommeth more thin, and the aire more pure, whereby wee may see vnto the starres, as through a transparent glasse, or the light of the Sunne, which obscureth the brightnesse of the Starres, neuer departeth farre from vs in Sommer, leauing a mixture of his light aboue the Horizon, whereas in winter he is much depressed, for the darker the night, the brighter the starres, and the more appeare, so the aire bee cleare. And this is another cause.


Of the magnitude of the Starres compared to the Earth.
Amongst the number of the fixed starres, there be six magnitudes, and the least is bigger then the earth, as followeth.
Starres of the first magnitude are to the globe of the earth, as 6859 to 64, their diameters beeing as 19 to 4, and therefore containe the globe of the earth 107 times, and @ thereof, as the Heart of the Lyon, Orion, the Goat, etc.
Starres of the second magnitude, bee to the globe of the earth, as 19465109 to 216000, their diameters being as 269 to 60, and therefore exceedeth the earth 90@ times, as the right side of Perseus, the right thigh of Pegasus, etc.
Starres of the third magnitude be to the globe of the earth, as 15625 is vnto 216, their diameters being as 25 to 6, exceeding the earth 72 ^/^ times, as the Girdle of Andromeda, etc.
Starres of the fourth magnitude, bee to the
globe of the earth, as 6859 is to 125. their diamemeters being as 19 to 5, containing the earth 54 times, as the North Asellus, the former and later of the Kids, etc.
Starres of the fifth magnitude be to the globe of the earth as 1685159 is to 46656. their diameters being as 119 to 36, containing the earth 36@ times, as the third of the fourth in the left wing of Virgo, the right knee of Leo, etc.
Starres of the sixth magnitude be to the globe of the earth, as 9261 is vnto 512, their diameters being as 31 to 8, and therefore containe the globe of the earth 18 ^^/19 times.


Of Constellations.
A Constellation, called otherwise an Asterisme, is a represe^ting of a lining creature, or some other thing (after a certaine sort) as well for that the number of starres in that place represent ye forme of such a creature, or such a figure, as also for that these figures expresse some property of ye starres that are in them.
Of these Constellations, the number that bee in all the heauens, bee 48, whereof 21 bee in the North, in the South 15, and in the Zodiacke of the eighth spheare be 12, as Aries, Taurus, etc. But besides these constellations, there be some other more lately deuised, as Antinous and Berenices haire. Also the constellations recounted by the Portugals, as the Crosse, the Doue, the Triangle, and the little Clouds about the South pole.


Of the twinkling of Starres.
The starres do not twinckle, as we thinke they
do, onely our eyes bee deceiued by the motion of the aire: for as the aire hath one motion proper, that is vpwards, so hath it another motion improper, caused by the reuolution of the heauens euery 24 houres, which draw all the aiery region about therewith, by which meanes, the apparent forme of the starres is distracted, seeming to cast forth sparkles, called twinckling, which wee may well proue by a peece of siluer in the bottome of a swift running riuer, or by looking vpon the stars, which by reflection be seene in the same.
But the Planets doe not twinckle, because they bee farre more neere vnto vs, whereby their beames be stronger, and lesse distorted, piercing strongly through the aire, so that they shine cleare without any twinckling: for the nearer any light is vnto vs, the stronger is the beame of the light that proceedeth from the same.


What the starres be made of.
The Starres be of the same matter as the Heauen is, wherin they be fixed, they be defined, Densior pars sui orbis, so that they bee of the same matter, though farre more thicke, apt to receiue and retaine the light of the Sunne, whereby they become subiect to the sight: for let the light of a candle pierce through any hole vpon the roofe of some darke house, and the light of the same will appeare, and make that part shining and subiect to sight, whereas the contrary would happen in a light and perspicuous place: for the heauen it selfe is most pure and thinne, and not visible, and therefore some thinke the milke-white circle in heauen
called of Astronomers, Galaxia, is more visible then the rest of the heauen, Arist. saith, but vntruly, that it is a Meteor; Others say, it is made by reason of the number of starres in that place, which confusedly mingle their light together, as Democritus: therefore vnderstand a starre to be of the same matter as his heauen is, being onely the thickest part of his orbe, which reflecting, not transmitting the beames of the Sun, cause him to be more shining and subiect to sight.



CHAP. XI. Of the 6 great Circles in Heauen, and the twelue Signes.
MAN, with the pencell of imagination, hath traced out in the 8 spheare, 6 great circles, and also 4 lesser: the great circles are, first the Horizon, which some call the Finitor, and is a great circle diuiding the visible part of the heauen from the inuisible: that is, the vpper hemispheare from the lower.
2 The Meridian is a circle passing by the poles of the world, and the Verticall point, to which circle when the Sunne commeth, aboue the earth it is noone, and vnder the earth, night,
3 The Equinoctiall is a great circle diuiding the spheare into two parts, and when the Sunne is therein (which happeneth twise euery yeare) the daies and nights are equal through the world, vnlesse with such that inhabite iust vnder the Poles.

4 The Zodiaque is a great oblique circle, 12 degrees broad, diuiding the spheare into two equal parts, and crossing the Equinoctiall in Aries and Libra, so that the part vpon the North side the Equinoctiall is called the North part, and ye other betweene the Equinoctiall and the South pole, ye South moity of the Zodiaque: In the middest of this broad circle is a line called the Eclipticke, or via Solis, for that the Sunne and Moone bee neuer eclipsed, but in that circle: so that there bee 6 degrees vpon the North side the line, and other 6 vpon the South side the Eclipticke, which is called North and South Declination, further then which ye Sun departs not North or South, being bounded with the Tropiques. This circle is called Zodiacus a (...), which is vita, because according to the motion of the Planets vnder the same, life is giuen vnto all inferiour creatures, or it is called (...) Zodion, which is Animal, because it is diuided into 12 equall parts, euery part being called a signe, and haue the name of some one liuing creature or other, agreeing to the nature of those parts, or by reason of the disposition of the fixed starres, agreeing to the nature of those beasts: with the Latines it is called Signifer, quia sert signa, or because it is diuided into them. Arist. in Lib. 2. de Generatione and Corruptione, calleth it Circulus obliquus, where hee saith, that according to the accesse and recesse of the Sunne in this oblique circle, all generation and corruption is made in these inferiors: the which signes with their characters follow.

1 Aries @.2 Taurus @.3 Gemini II.4 Cancer @.5 Leo @.6 Virgo @.7 Libra @.8 Scorpio @9 Sagitarius @.10 Capricornus @.11 Aquarius @.12 Pisces @. Of which 12 signs the first 6 be called Northerne, the other Southerne, the Astronomers doe also diuide some into Ascendents, as from Capricorne to the end of Gemini, Others into Descendents; as from the beginning of Cancer, to the end of Sagitarius: some againe be Vernal, as Aries, Taurus, and Gemini: some Estiuall, as Cancer, Leo, Virgo: some Autumnall, as Libra, Scorpio, Sagitarius: and some Hiemall, or Brumall, as Capricorne, Aquarius, and Pisces, which signifie the 4 quarters of the yeare: the first compared to sanguine, and attributed to child-hood; the second choler, attributed to youth; the third melancholy, attributed to elder age; and the last flegme, attributed unto old age. Also some are of the fiery Triplicity, as Aries, Leo, Sagitarius; some of the earthly Triplicity, as Taurus, Virgo, Capricorne; some of ye aiery triplicity, as Gemini, Libra, Aquarius; and some of the watry Triplicity, as Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces. Some againe are moueable, others fixed, others common: Some likewise bee Orientall, some Meridionall, some Occidentall, and some Septentrionall, some diurnall, some Nocturnall, some Masculine, and others seminine, as shal appeare in their proper natures.
5 and 6. The Colures are two great circles moueable and passing by ye poles of the world, whose office is to distinguish the Solstitials and Equinoctials,
they bee called Colures a (...) with the Greekes, which is Membrum, and (...), which is Bos syluester, because the taile of a wilde beast being erected (which is a member) doth make a semicircle yet vnperfect: or as Schola interprets it, A (...) with the Greekes, or (...), the first, sillable beeing short, a (...), which is Mutilum, mancum, vnperfect, or maimed, and (...), which is Cauda the taile, because they appeare vnperfect, or maimed, being neuer seene all at once to vs, but as it were the taile or some part cut off: these two circles, the one passe by the beginning of Cancer and Capricorne, appointing the Sommer and Winter Solstitials: the other by the beginning of Aries and Libra, coequating ye dayes and nights, and crosse one the other with tight sphericall angles vpon the poles of the world, and these 4 times are expressed in these 2 verses.

Hac duo Solstitium faciunt: Cancer, Capricornus:
Sed noctes aequant Aries, and Libra diebus.



CHAP. XII. Of the foure lesser Circles in Heauen.
THese circles bee called lesser circles, because they diuide not the spheare into two equall parts, as the great circles doe, and they bee foure in number, called the two Polar circles, and the two Tropickes, of which Polar circles, the one is called ye Arctique, the other the Antarctique, both being made by the conuersion of the Poles of the Ecliptique, so that they be alwaies distant as far
from the poles of the world, as the Sunnes greatest declination from the Equinoctiall commeth to, which is 23 degrees 28 minutes: the Arctique taketh his name of Arctos, which is the Beare, whose one fore-foote doth also describe this circle. This circle is also called Septentrional, of Septentrio, which signifies 7 Oxen, represented by the 7 starres in the lesser Beare. The Tropickes take their names from the Greekes also, a (...), which is conuersio, or (...), which with Cicero lib. 2. de natura Deor. is Reuersio, so that taking the Tropique from Tropos, it is a conuersion or reuersion of the Sunne, because being in either of these circles, hee alwaies turneth againe towards the Equinoctiall.


CHAP. XIII. Of Time.
TIme is the measurer of motion, and (as Armandus saith) of Rest and Quietnesse, containing three parts; Past, Present, and to Come: Time present, called (Nunc) being a moment indiuisible, or the least part of Time, and yet the beginner and ender of time: euen as a point is the least part of a line, and yet beginneth and endeth the same; for Nunc (now, this instant) doth knit Tempus praeteritum, and futurum, ending time past, and beginning time to come. There is also a space or time, called Seculum. An age in English, being an hundred yeares: at the end of which time, in Rome they were vsed to celebrate Plaies, called Ludi seculares. There is another
space of time, containing a thousand yeares, called Aeuum, being ten Ages; But Iohannes de sacro Bosco, diuides the lesser parts of time into fiue parts, as Quadrans, the fourth part of the day, or six houres, an houre being the 24 part of a natural day; 2 Punctus in the Sunnes account the 4 part of an houre, in the Moones the 5 part; 3 Momentum, the 10 part of Punctus; 4 Vncia the 12 part of Momentum, and the last is Atomos, the 44 part of Vncia.


CHAP. XIIII. Of the day both Naturall and Artificiall, and their diuers beginnings.
THe day is of two sorts, Naturall and Artificiall, the Naturall day is the space of 24 houres, in which time the Sunne is caried by the first Mouer, from the East into the West, and so round about the world into the East againe.
The Artificiall day continues from Sunne rising to Sunne setting, and the Artificiall night is from the sunnes setting to his rising. And you must note that this naturall day, according to diuers, hath diuers beginnings, as the Romanes count it from mid-night to mid-night, because at that time our Lord was borne, being Sunday, and so do we account it for fasting dayes. The Arabians begin their day at Noone, and end at Noone ye next day: for because they say the Sunne was made in the Meridian, and so doe all Astronomers account the day, because it alwaies falleth at
one certaine time. The Vmbrians, the Tuscan^, the Iewes, the Athenians, Italians, and Egyptians, do begin their day at sunne set, and so do we celebrate festiuall daies. The Babylonians, Persians, and Bohemians, begin their day at sunne rising, holding till sunne setting, and so do our Lawyers count it in England.
The Phisitians diuide the day into 4 quarters, the first is from the 9 houre of the night to the 3 houre of the day, warme and moist, mouing to sanguine. The second is from the 3 houre of the Artificiall day, to the 9 houre, warme and dry, increasing choler. The third is from the 9 houre to the 3. houre of the night, cold and dry, begetting melancholy. The fourth is from the 3 houre of the night, to the 9 againe, cold and moist, causing phlegme.
Ioannes de sacro Bosco diuides the Artificiall day thus into 4 quarters, calling the first Rubens, the second Splendens, the third vrens, and the fourth Tepens, whereupon the sunne is fained to haue 4 horses, Eous, Lampas, Pyrois, and Phlegon.
The Iewes began at sun rising, and so diuided the Artificial day into 4 quarters, alotting to euery quarter 3 houres, wherby also they diuided the day Artificiall into 12 equall parts, calling euery part an houre, and beginning at sunne rising: so that 12 a clocke, or high noone, was their 6 houre, and sunne set their 12 houre: so that where the Scriptures say: The Ague left him the seuenth houre, that is, at one a clocke; so the labourers ye came into the Vineyard at the 11 houre, came at
fiue of the clock: but by this 5 a clock is meant the houre of the Artificiall day, and not the Naturall day, the which is knowne according to the time of the yeare: for the Artificiall day is done some time of the yeare before 5, as in the 25 Chapter.


CHAP. XV. Of the names of the Dayes, and their Etymologie.
THe Iewes call their first day Sabbatum, the next, Prima Sabbati, the next, secunda Sabbati, etc. according as is written: Mane prima Sabbati surgens Dei filius: that is, the first day after the Sabboth, which is our Sunday, vpon which day the Romanes (calling the Planets Gods) began their account, calling ye first the day of the Sun, the next of ye Moone, the next of Mars, the next of Mercury, the fifth of Iupiter, the sixth of Venus, and the last of Saturne, still skipping to the third Planet, because the 24 houres in the Artificiall day and night, are giuen to the 7 Planets successiuely: so that if Sol rule the first houre vpon Sunday, (as hee must, because it is his owne day) then Venus hath the next, and so proceed, giuing euery of the 24 houres a Planet in true succession, and you shall finde, that the 24 houre, which beginneth Munday, falleth to ye Moone; therefore if any day be denominated by any one planet, the next day following taketh denomination of the third Planet next following, which order after the Christians obserued. And you shall note, that
a day in Latine, called Dies, is so called, a (...), which is Clarus, or a (...), which is Duo, because ye naturall day is diuided into 2 parts, to wit, into Day, and Night: or it may be called Dies, a Dijs: for the Planets be called Dij, (Gods) whereof the dayes take their names.
Nox, the Night, is so called, a Noceo, noces, because it is Tempus nocentibus aptum, a fit time to do hurt and mischiefe.


CHAP. XVI. Of the Weeke.
A Weeke hath diuers names, in Latine it is called Septimana, a Septem and Mane, as it were, hauing septem Matutina tempora, seauen mornings: And so pars is taken pro toto. It is also called Hebdomada, ab (...), which is septem, as containing seauen daies. It is also called Sabbatum by the Iewes, and therefore it is said in Scripture, Ieiuno bis in Sabbato, etc. wherby Sabbatum is Aequiuocum ad totam septimanam. And you must note, that the Iewes Sabboth day was Saterday, but the Christians obserued Sunday for to begin their weeke, because on that day our Lord was borne, rose, and sent his holy Ghost vpon his Apostles.


CHAP. XVII. Of a Moneth, Solar, and Vsuall.
OF Moneths there be three kinds, Solar, Lunar, and Vsuall. The Solar moneth is the
space of time that the Sun runneth through one signe of the Zodiacke, being 30 dayes.
The Vsuall Moneth is the number of dayes according as they bee in our Kalender, and amongst the Latines, Romulus first distinguished the moneths, diuiding ye yeare into 10 moneths, because in that time a woman might bring forth a childe, or because (during that time) it was not fit for a woman to marry after the death of her husband.
The first moneth he called Martius, a Marte, of Mars his Father, or rather of Mars in respect of warre, because as then the Romane Kings were vsed to proceed in expeditions: for it is rather thought that Amulius was Romulus his Father. then Mars, Amulius being his vnckle.
The next moneth he called Aprill, ab Aperiendo, because then the poares of the earth opened. The third is May, a Maioribus: the fourth Iunius, a Iunioribus. The rest of the moneths were called Quintilis, Sextilis, September, October, Nouember, and December, because they were 5 6, etc moneths distant from March. But after, Numa Pompilius added, two more moneths, to make them twelue, calling the one Ianuary, a Ianua, because as you passe per Ianuam in atrium: so per Ianuarium in annum: or of Ianus, the God of Merchandize, who hauing two faces, so Ianuary hath two respects, the one to the yeare past, the other to the yeare to come. The other moneth he called February, a Februo: that is, a Plutone, because then the Romans offered sacrifice to
Pluto, and the infernall Gods, for the soules of their ancestors: or it is called February, a Febre, because as then in warme regions, men were accustomed, Febricitare, that is, to be sicke of an Ague: so also may September be said, quasi septimus ab imbre, which is a Tempore pluuioso. And to these moneths he gaue some 30 daies, others 31 daies orderly: so that when he came to Ianuary he wanted a day, which he tooke from February, which he restored againe in the Leape-yeare. Then commeth Iulius Caesar, and altereth the moneth Quintilis to Iuly, calling it after his name: for that hee was borne in that moneth. After whom commeth Augustus, and calleth the moneth Sextilis Augustus, after his owne name; and grudging that his moneth August should haue lesser dayes in it then Caesars moneth, hee taketh another day from February, adding the same to August, and thereby left February but 28 dayes, whereby hee did disorder the daies of the moneth, that before did consist of 30 and 31 daies successiuely, making Iuly, August, and September haue 31 dayes altogether, and February but 28 dayes: wherefore to auoid this inconuenience, he was forced to take a day from September, giuing it to October, and another from Nouember for December. The which ordination of ye moneths, and position of dayes, is vsed to this present time, according to these verses:

Sep. No. Iun. Ap. dato triginta: reliquis magic vno:
Nisit bissextus, februus minor esto duobus.



Which is,


Thirty daies hath September,
Aprill, Iune, and Nouember:
The rest haue thirty and one,
Saue February alone.
Which moneth hath but eight and twenty meare,
Saue when it is Bissextile, or Leape-yeare.



CHAP. XVIII. Of the Lunar Moneth, and the diuersities thereof.
OF Moneths Ioan. de sacro Bosco noteth 4 kinds, as the moneth of Peragration, of Apparition, Medicinall, and the moneth of Consecution.
The moneth of Peragration is a space of time containing daies 27, houres 7, minutes 43, seconds 7, thirds 15, fourths 36, fifths 55. In which space the Moone runneth through the 12 signes of the Zodiacke, and is called of some a yeare, of which yeares it is not much for one to liue 1000: for 80 Solar yeares make as many within 40. But this moneth is accomplished certaine minuts sooner or later, according to her swift or slow motion.
The second is the Moneth of Aparition consisting of 28 dayes, vulgarly diuided into foure weekes.
The Moneth Medicinall containeth (according to Galen) 26 daies and a halfe, and is also diuided into 4 weekes.

The last is the moneth of Consecution, being a space of time that the Moone departing from coniunction with the Sunne, passeth round about the circls of the Zodiacke, returning to ye point where she left the Sunne, finishing her Moneth of Peragration, but finding the Sunne not there, because he is carried by his owne proper motion neere one signe further, shee is forced to spend two daies, 4 houres, 44 I. 3 II. and 16 III. to ouertake the Sunne, before shee can come into coniunction againe: so that this moneth is produced vnto 29 daies and a halfe, etc. and is called the Moneth of Consecution: for that the Moone prosecutes to ouertake the Sunne.


CHAP. XIX. Of the Lunar Yeare, both Common and Extraordinary.
OF Lunar yeares there bee two kindes, the one is called in Latine Annus Communis, the other Embolismalis. The common Lunar yeare is the space of 12 Moones (not Moneths) or changes, which the Latines call Lunations, it is called the common yeare Lunar, in respect of his accord with the Solar yeare: for as the one containes 12 Moones Lunar: so the other consisteth of 12 moneths Solar, the one hauing 365 dayes, the other 354 dayes; (but in both there is omission of fractions) so that the Solar yeare exceeds the common Lunar yeare, 11 dayes, of which the Epact is made.

The yeare called Annus Embolismalis, is a space of 13 Moones, containing 384 dayes, so that this yeare exceedeth the common Lunar yeare 30 daies, and the Solar yeare 19 dayes, it is called Embolismus ab Embolismo, as Bissextilis is a Bis sex, Sacro Bosco castles it Embolismus ab (...), which is quiddam insertum.


CHAP. XX. Of the Solar yeare, and the Etymology thereof.
THe Astronomers make many diuisions of this Solar yeare, which are not much needfull to be knowne, in respect of this Treatiss. To bee therefore short, the Solar yeare is a space of time that the Sunne by his proper motion departing from some point in the Eclipticke, returneth to the same place againe: and this yeare Solar is either Astronomicall, or Poeticall; the Astronomicall yeare is either Tropicall, or Sidereall; and the Tropicall yeare is either Equall or Vnequall. The Tropicall yeare taketh his beginning from the Vernall Equinox, containing 365 dayes, 5 houres, 49 minuts, 15 seconds, and 46 thirds, but the vnequall or aparent Tropical yeare containes sometime more, as 365 dayes, 5 houres, 56 minuts, 53 seconds, and 1 third; and other times lesse, as 365 dayes, 5 houres, 42 minutes, 38 seconds, and 27 thirds: And this vnequality is made by the vnequall precession of the Equinoctiall points.

The Egyptians wanting the vse of letters, set forth the yeare like an Adder eating her owne taile: so that it may bee said, Annus ab Anguis a Snake; wee may depaint the yeare by a King, in respect they both turne round in themselues: so may it be called Annus from Annulus, a King: for a motion in a King finished, beginneth againe without end, and therefore Virgil
Atque in se sua per vostigia voluitur Annus.
Some call a yeare, Annus ab innouatione, because the strength and vertue of all vegetable things is renewed, and are passed ouer by the course of time: It is called Annus ab An, which is Circum, and eo in, by reason of the foresaid reuolution of Time.


CHAP. XXI. Of the Iulian yeare, or our vulgar yeare, and of the Leap-yeare, and the cause thereof, with the diuers beginnings of yeares.
IVlius Caesar, anno mundi, 3925.45 yeares before the birth of Christ, and the yeare before his bloudy death noting the falsenesse of the yeare then vsed, by the Councell of Sosigenes, an excellent Mathematitian, made the yeare to consist of 365 dayes and 6 houres, and because it would be very difficult to computate these 6 houres euery yeare: for should you begin this yeare at 12 of the clocke and 6 houres, it must end the next yeare at 12 and 6 houres, and the next yeare following would end at mid-night, etc. So that wee
should driue the beginning of the yeare euery 4 yeares a day further, without the getting of a day: so that in 124 yeares, the Annuntiation of Mary would fall to bee where Saint Marke Euangelist is, or a day sooner. To auoyd which inconuenience Caesar concluded, that at euery foure yeares there should be a day gotten by the surplus of the 6 houres in euery yeare: for 4 times 6 make 24 houres, which day he added to February, for that it is the shortest moneth, and according to ye ancient, and also according to our Churches account, the last moneth; and this day they put at the 25 of February, so that the letter F is twise repeated, Saint Mathias day being obserued vpon the later, according to the verse
Bissextum sextae Martis tenuere Calendae,Posteriore die celebrantur festa Mathiae.
So that the Iulian yeare is two-fold, as Iulian and Bissextill, it is called Bissextill, of bis and sex, because the 6 Kalends of March is twise repeated: so may it be called Annus intercalaris, because of the day that is put betweene: so may February in that respect be called Mensis intercalaris, and so may the 25 of February, that yeare, be called Dies intercalaris.
But since the Romanes haue found that this Iulian yeare was too great, and by helpe of Antonius Lilius, they haue abated the quantity of the yeare, making it to consist of 365 daies, 5 houres, 49 minutes, and 12 seconds, whereby their account in the celebration of the festiuall daies, and of the times of the yeare, differeth 11 dayes from
ours, as in my Kalender; and yet is neither of these accounts precisely true, by occasion of the vnequall precession of the Equinoctiall points, of which here is no place to speake.
By this that is said, in the Chapters before, you may gather that a weeke hath seuen dayes, or 168 houres; a moneth 4 weekes, 30 dayes, or 720 houres (I speake of Solar moneths;) and a yeare 52 weekes, 12 moneths, 365 dayes, or 8760 houres: But the leape yeare hath 366 daies, or 8784 houres, wanting indeed, according vnto true calculation 47 minutes, and 12 seconds, and so much doth euery foure yeares differ from our Iulian yeare, which is 11 minutes, and 48 seconds euery yeare.
And you must note, that according vnto diuers men, the yeare hath diuers beginnings, which some call Aera; Numa Pompilius did begin the yeare at the Hyemall Solstitiall, because as then the Sunne began to ascend.
Romulus began the yeare at the Equinoctiall of March, because as then all things began to flourish, all trees and plants to bud, etc.
The Arabians begin their yeare at the Estiuall Solstitiall, because they are of opinion yt the Sun was made in Leo. Some let their yeare take beginning at the Autumnall Equinoctiall. The Egyptians count from the death of Nabuchadonozor; the Persians from Iezdegird, the Arabians or Moores, from the preaching of Mahomet, who was after the birth of Christ, 626 yeares. The Astronomers begin their yeare the first of Ianuary,
and so do we take it vulgarly in England: But the Church of England, and the date of all writings, and such like, hath their yeare to begin vpon the 25 day of March. The Iewes began their yeare after two sorts, viz, for feasts in March, and for other affaires in September: And so must wee vnderstand Ezechiel, chap. 40. vers. 1. The Spaniards did reckon their yeare for tributes, and all other payments, from the Emperour Octauian, vntill King Iohn altered it to the Natiuity of our Lord; and you shall note that it was 500 yeares after the birth of Christ, that the Christians did begin their yeare at the Annunciation of Mary.


CHAP. XXII. Vulgar errours reformed.
I Tould you before in what time the Sunne did finish his course through the 12 signes of the Zodiaque, and here you must know further, that he hath three motions, as slow, being in Apogaeon, or his greatest Eccentricity, and then goeth not aboue 57 minutes, 18 seconds in 24 houres, and sometime but 56 minuts, 43 seconds. Swift, being in Perigaeon, or nearest the earth, and then may goe one degree, 1 minute, and 43 seconds in 24 houres: and his meane motion, at what times he passeth 59 minuts, and 8 seconds in 24 houres, by occasion whereof diuers things happen contrary, as the vulgar take it, as there be more daies by about 10 from the Equinoctiall of March vnto the Equinoctiall of September, then there is
from the Equinoctiall of September to the Equinoctiall of March.
By occasion of this diuersity of the Sunnes motion, the vulgar be also much deceiued, that say that the dayes doe lengthen and shorten one houre euery 15 dayes, which is false, indeed from the 11 of March vnto the 27 of Aprill that proportion is true: but then from the 27 of Aprill it must be to the 17 day of May, which is 20 daies before the day be an houre longer, and then from the 17 of May (at what time the day is 16 houres long in the latitude of 52 degrees, and 20 minuts) vnto the 12 of Iune, which is 26 dayes, the day doth but lengthen halfe an houre and 3 minutes. The like it doth in shortning.
Another errour doe they run into concerning the Dogge-dayes, wherein the old Computation was much to blame, in pretending a certainty for the beginning of them the 6 of Iuly, and ending the 17 of August, which is false, as I noted in my Almanacke 1607: But as there, so also in this Kalender shall they be truly placed: the effect of the Starre Plin. reporteth, lib. 1. chap. 40. of his Naturall History.
Another errour most runne into, concerning the primeing of the moone: for it is not (as they suppose) alwaies vpon the 5 day, it containes a halfe quarter of yt Moone, and happeneth she being 3 daies and 18 houres old, being then 4 points of the compasse to the Eastward of the Sunne.
Also you shall note that when the hornes of the Moone hang perpendicular one ouer the other,
then the Moone is 90 degrees of the Eclipticke aboue the Horizon; if the vpper horne incline more into the East then the lower horne doth, then she is short of 90 degrees: but if the vpper horne be more into the West, the Moone is more then 90 degrees of the Eclipticke from the Horizon: but this is not meant degrees of altitude, taken instrumentally.


CAAP. XXIII. Of the Kalends, Nones, etc. And what they be.
YOu must know that in euery moneth there be three principall dayes, which (as the Romans pleased) gaue denomination to all the rest of the daies in the yeare, and they be called Kalends, Nones, and Ides.
The Kalends be the first day of euery moneth, from which the daies are accounted backwards, calling the next day in this regression, Pridie Calendas, as the last of March is Pridie Calendas Aprilis; they were called Kalends, or Calendae, as it were Colendae, because in old time they were vsed to sanctifie the first day of euery moneth in honour of Iuno: and therefore Ouid said:
Vendicat Ausonias Iunonis cura Calendas.
Or they be called Kalends of (...) Calo, which is voco, to call, because the first day of euery moneth the Pontifex minor standing in an eminent place of ye Citie, did make 4 calles or more, according to the number of daies, that the Faires, called Nundinae, should endure: and therefore in the plurall number
they bee called Calendae, as it were calles.
Or they may bee called Kalendae, Kalends, a (...), which is Bonum, because the first day of euery moneth one friend was accustomed mutually to giue certaine gifts or presents to another, to the end that all the moneth following, there might happen to them bonum omen.
Now the Nones bee certaine daies placed in euery moneth, wherof the most hath but 6, and the moneth yt hath least, 4. they begin at the Ides, and end at the Kalends: they take their name (as some say) of Non, because during that time, the Romanes sanctified no day to their God, as may appeare by Ouid:
Nonarum tutela Deo caret, etc.
Or they might be called Noue, by reason of the renouation of their images euery moneth: or they are called Nonae, a Nundinis, which is Faires, or markets, because the number of Nones, limited the duration thereof in euery moneth.
Lastly, about the midst of euery moneth there be certaine daies called Ides, which is (as it were) Diuisions: for they diuide euery moneth into 2 parts, and are a number of 8 daies, which in euery moneth (according to the order of daies in our Kalender) follow the Nones, according to the verse.
Octo tenent Idus menses generaliter omnes.
But some moneths haue more Nones then others, as in the verse.
Mar. Ma. lul. Oct. senas, reliquis dato bis duo Nonas.
Therefore if you take all the Nones and Ides,
of euery moneth, and adde them together, substracting the whole from the number of dayes in the moneth, then is the remainder the number of Kalends in that moneth; and as there is Pridie Kalendas, so there is Pridie Nonas, and Pridie Idus.
And you must know, that amongst the ancient Astronomers, there bee certaine vnfortunate dayes in euery moneth, the which in many matters they held ominous and fatall: but of the truth thereof let them iudge that are obseruers thereof; onely I will set them downe, lest of some the booke bee condemned for their absence, and in such sort as no one as yet hath obserued.


CHAP. XXIIII. Of the infortunate and fatall dayes of the yeare, as also of the good and happy dayes.

IAnuary the 1.2.4.5.10.15.17.19.
February the 8.10. and the 17.
March the 15.16. and the 19.
Aprill the 16. and 21. Not so euill the 7.8.10.20.
May the 7.11.20. Not so bad the 3. and 5.
Iune the 4. and 7. Not so euill. 10.15.22.
Iuly the 15.20.
August the 19.20. These not so bad, 1.29. and 30.
September the 6 and 7. Not so bad, the 3.4.21.22.
October the 5. Not so bad, the 3.16.24.
Nouember the 15.19. Not so bad 5.6.28.29.
December the 6.7.9. Not so euill the 15.17.22.

Furthermore, Astrologers will haue in euery
Moone 2 infortunate daies, wherein they recount it most vnhappy to begin or vndertake any kinds of worldly affaires, and they repute them right perilous many wayes else, the which dayes follow.
In Ianuary the 3 and 4 day of the new Moone. February the 5 and 7. March the 6 and 7. April the 5 and 8. May the 8 and 9. Iune the 5 and 15. Iuly the 3 and 13. August 8 and 13. September 8 and 13. October 5 and 12. Nouember the 5 and 9. December the 3 and 13.
Againe, there bee sixe most infortunate daies chosen out of the whole yeare by some, wherein they aduertise no man to bleed, because of great danger of death: and for that the effects of the Constellations worke most wonderfull to death, and otherwise be right vnfortunate: It is therefore very ill to haue a child borne in them, for feare of an euill death; and bad and vnhappy they be in other humane affaires, as ye ancients teach, and they be.
Ianuary the 3 day. Iuly the 1. October the 2. Aprill the 30. August the 1. and the 31.
Moreouer, in euery moneth there were two dayes which were called Aegri, mali, and Aegyptiaci, they be called Aegri, ab effectu, because, according to the opinion of many, if any fell sicke in any of these dayes, they should hardly or neuer escape it: They bee called Mali, because it was naught to begin any kinde of worke, by reason of the euill affections of the Constellations: They be called Aegyptiaci, because they were inuented
of the Egyptians: and they do also note vnto vs the 10 plagues of Egypt in these verses:

Sanguis, rana, culex, muscae paruae, pecus, vlcus;
Grando, locustae, nox, mors, prius orta necant.
Bloud, frogs, lice, flies, all cattell lost their breath,
Plague, haile, locusts, night, no man scaped death.

Now these infortunate daies were noted alwaies in the Romane Kalender, notwithstanding ye inhibition of Augustine, saying: Calendas mensium, and dies Aegyptiacos, non obseruetis. But yet to satisfie all, take them in the ensuing verses.

Armis Gunfe. Dei Kalatos, Adamare dabatur.
Linamemor, Constans gelidos, Infancia quosdam.
Omne limen, Aaron bagis, Concordia laudat.
Chije linkat, Ei Coequatae, Gearcha Lifardus.

Of the words in these foure verses, euery two serue for one moneth, the first standing for Ianuary: If therefore you desire to know the first of the two former fatall daies in any moneth, count so many daies from the beginning of the moneth descending, as the first letter in the first word is distant from A inclusiuely, according to the Alphabet, and where that number ends, there is the fatall day; as in Aprill L. (beginning Lixa) is the 10 letter in the Alphabet, therefore the 10 day is fatall, and according to the number of the first letter (in the order of ye Alphabet) of the seco^d sillable, ye said houre of yt said day is vehemently to be suspected.
But to haue the second fatall day of the moneth, you must reckon so many daies from the last day of the moneth ascending, as the number of yt first letter of the second word, for yt moneth, commeth
vnto in the order of the Alphabet, as in Aprill M. for Memor, is the 11 letter in the Alphabet, therefore the 11 day before the last of Aprill is a fatall day which is the 19 day of Aprill, and so as before, the first letter of the second sillable doth shew the most infortunate houre, according to the number thereof in the Alphabet, and you must note, that H in this account is taken for no letter.
Againe, there be certain vnfortunat and bad daies in ye yeare, called Dog-daies, as before is reme^bred.
Likwise through England, the 28 of December, being Innocents day, is called Crosse-day, and so is it accounted euery weeke.
There be other daies recounted in a little foolish booke, called the Booke of Knowledge, taken according to the course of the Moone, as thus: The first day of the Moone Adam was made, and that he counteth a fortunate day, but it is false: for Adam was not made the first day of the Moone; for the fourth day of the creation was the Sun and Moone made, and Adam the 6 day: so that the Moone was made 2 daies before Adam, and what vertue should the moone receiue by the creation of Adam. The like errour is vpon the 2 day of the moone for Eue, and so of the rest, which since their errours is apparent, they be better omitted the repeated and for the truth of the rest I commend to your experience.
And you must note that there be other daies infortunate and euill, caused by the motions of the starres and planets and by the aspects of the Moone to the rest of the 6 planets, as in the ensuing table is compendiously to bee seene.

Poets be busy, make verses, exercise thy things witty, let thy Children goe to schoole.
Accompany Penne-men, send messengers, take a iourney, exercise the Mathematickes.




And you must not, yt yt fortunate planets be Iupiter and Venus; yt infortunate and wicked are Saturne and Mars; the indifferent be Sol, Mercury, and Luna.
So that the Coniunction of the good, is good; of the euill, had; and of the indifferent, indifferent, excepting the Sunne and Moone.
Also the good in Coniunction with yt bad, is bad; the good with the meane is indifferent, and the bad with the meane is bad.
Certaine daies of the yeare be also good or bad, according to the place of the Moone in ye heauens, and those places bee called Mansions, as in the Table, according to which the temperature and quality of the day is much altered.

The vse of the precedent Table.
In the first row vpon the left hand finde the lenghth of the day or night in houres, and if there be any minuts annexed, finde them in the top of the Table, where they bee set thus: 0, 12, 24, 36, 48. And so in the common angle shall you finde the length of the planetary houre for the day or night, vnder their proper Title, and if you want the iust minute, take the neerest, for the difference produceth no sensible errour: as when the day is 16 houres, 24 minutes long then the length of a planetary hour for day is 1 houre, 22 minuts, and aplanet ruleth that night but 38 minutes, as in the Table.
The length of a planetary houre thus found, it rests to finde any time of day what planetary houre it is, which as yet none of these little bookes haue taught: You must therefore learne (as hereafter) at what houre and minute the Sunne doth rise vpon the day proposed, and also ye true houre of the day at the time proposed, by some clocke, or rather Sunne-diall, and thereby get how many houres and minutes the said proposed time is after Sunne rising, the number of which houres multiply by 60, and to the product adde the odde minute: then the totall diuided by the number of minutes, that a planet reigneth, the quotient is the number of the planetary houre.

Example.

The Sunne riseth at 8 of the clocke (vpon a certaine day) which day is 8 houres long, and I
am required to finde what planetary houre it was at 10 before Noone: 10 is two houres after 8, 2 multiplied by 60, yeeldes 120. which parted by 40 minutes (for so long a Planet ruleth that day, as in the Table) and the quotient is 3. Therefore I conclude it is the third planetary houre, and if there had beene any minutes remaining, those would haue shewen how many minutes of the planetary houre had beene spent.


Deale so with the night, counting them from Sunne set.



Otherwise.

Another way I can shew you; hauing any time of the day giuen, and are required to know what planetary houre it is at that instant, you must consider if the question were made before high noone, or after: if the question were made before noone, worke as before: if after noone, adde the houre of the clocke after noone to the houre and minute of Sunne setting: so haue you the distance of time from Sun-rising, then worke likewise as before.

Lastly, hauing found what planetary houre it is, then must you seeke what planet doth reigne that houre, which is thus done: Consider what planet the day is called by, as in the 15 Chapter, and giue to that planet the first houre, and to the next the second houre, vntill you come to ye houre proposed, and that planet which falleth to that houre is the planet ye ruleth at that time. But for more ease behold the ensuing Table, which I haue newly made for that purpose.

The vse of the Table.
Seeke the day proposed in the top of the Table, and in one of the two rowes vnder the same day, finde the planetary houre, against which in the first row vpon the left hand is the character of the planet that gouerneth that houre of the day, vnder the title of Day Re. signifying Regniments of the day planets, and vpon the right hand is the planet that ruleth that houre of the night, vnder Night Regniment, as vpon Sunday, Mercury ruleth the third houre of the day, and Sol the same houre of the night.





CHAP. XXVI. Of the natures and properties of the seuen Planets.
SOmething I would say, that when you haue found what planet reigneth, you might likewise know the nature and condition thereof,, but I must bee briefe: for indeed heere is no place in this small volume to handle the same in such ample manner as it ought to be.
Saturne (being well affected) is graue with authority, thinking of deepe matters, disputing of grauity alouer of secret matters, silent, solitary, laborious, doing labour and toyle, a gatherer of wealth, couetous, desirous of money, and studious for his owne proper benefite, a Zelotype, bearing care of his body, vncertaine in keeping promise, a louer of husbandry; and being made infortunate and weake, he is an abiect, squalid, excogitating of base things, a pick, thanke and complainer, fearefull, auoiding light, louing solitarinesse, sad, enuious, stubborne, suspitious, superstitious, vntrimmed, malignant deceiptfull, yet fearing deceipt, couetous, austere, slothfull, dull and a lyar: His nature is cold and dry, and is charactred thus @.
Iupiter being the onely signifier and well affected, maketh men honest, religious, iust, doers of good turnes, magnanimous, faithfull, verecundious, beneuolent, manly famous gouernours, of great diligence, graue, and modest, giuen to follow
their businesse, wise carefull to liue, louers of their owne, and of their friends, liverall, and without fraud: But being euilly affected, is more prodigall and proud: His nature is hot and moist, thus figured @.
Mars, well affected, is generous, fit for gouernment and rule, valiant, strong, angry, giuen to battell and warre with vehemence, apt, without fraud, fearing no danger, desiring reuenge, impatient of seruitude and iniuries, vaunting, not respectiue of riches: and being euilly affected, is cruell, vniust, a brawler, a tyrant, a murtherer, dreadfull, rash, vnfearefull, proud, drunke. turbulent, a blond-shedder, fierce in prouoking quarrels, and fearefull to performe, the author of discords, arrogancy and seditious: He is hot and dry, thus charactred. @
Sol is the most noble Planet, hee is magnanimous, industrious, prouident, ambitious, signifying Kings Princes, Potentates, labourers of gold, he is valiant, secret, honest, quiet, giueth long life, and a healthfull body, a sincere and very good minde, princely dignities, and riches, and aboue the rest, he maketh men curteous famous wise, rulers, louers, desirous of honours: His Nature is hot and dry cholericke, and is thus charactred @.
Venus fortunatly affected, maketh one faire-spoken, good, a louer of sweet things, pleasant, merry, faire, delicate in gesture, elegant, a doer of good-turnes, pittifull, giuen to please, and apt to pleasures, giuen to singing and dauncing, impatient
of labour, gallant, and yeelding loue to such, sociable, yet seruing God religiously: But being euilly affected, she is effeminate, fearefull, a louer of maids, spending much vpon them, without respect of fame or infamy, idle, sluggish, apt to lust, a Zelotype, or giuen to iealousie: Her nature is cold and moist, flegmaticke, thus charactred @.
Mercury well scituate, and fortunate affected, causeth a sharpe wit, maketh one studious, capable of learning, easie to be taught, wise, subtill, wary, and heedfull, accomplishing all things with great dexterity, obtaining a great part of Poetry, Geometry, and the Mathematickes, without tutor, desiring many differences, and disputing elegantly of many matters, of good manners, wittily applying himselfe to time and place, an imitator of the good: But being infortunate and badly scituate, hee is maleuolent, malicious, subtile, crafty, forsworne, lying, especially his essentiall dignities being of the bad, and he neere the Dragons taile, for then he is most ill.
The Moone maketh one thoughtfull, vnstable, vagabonds, fearefull, faint-hearted, prodigall, she signifieth messengers, shipmen, Queenes, Ladies, also common people, fishers, and such that deale about waters, also such that are in continuall motion, as Lackies, etc. Also Widowes, mothers, etc. she maketh one delighting to study histories, to walke from place to place, to Nauigate, plant, etc.



CHAP. XXVII. A briefe discourse of the naturall causes of watery Meteors, as snow, haile, raine, etc.
YOu must first vnderstand, that all watery meteors, as raine, snow, or such like, is but a moist vapour drawne vp by the vertue of the Sun, and the rest of the Planets into the middle region of the aire, where being congealed or dissolued, falleth vpon the earth, as haile or raine.

Of the Raine-bow.
Pliny saith the Rain-bow is made by the Sun-beames striking vpon a hollow cloud, when their edge is repelled, and beaten backe against ye Sun, and thus ariseth variety of colours, by ye mixture of cloudes, aire, and fiery light together. But (as he saith) it pretendeth neither faire nor fowle wether.


Of Raine.
Of these kinde of meteors you may read Arist. libro primo Meteorologicorum, cap. 1. and 2. But briefly, Raine is a cold vapour, and earthly humour, raised from the earth and waters into the middle region of the aire, where by the extremity of cold it is thickned into the body of a cloud, and after being dissolued, falleth vpon the earth.


Of Haile.
Haile is ingendred of Raine, congealed into
Ice, freezing the drops presently after the dissoluing of the cloud, whereby wee haue great irregular stones fall on the earth; I haue seene them in that fashion 1610 containe 4 inches about: for the higher it commeth, and the longer it tarieth in the aire, the rounder it is and the lesser.


Of Snow.
Snow is of the same humour that Haile is, but not growne together so hard. Pliny saith, Haile sooner melts then Snow, and that Haile commeth oftner in the day then in the night.


Of Frost and Dew
When in the day time through ye faint heate of the Sun, there is a cold and moist vapour drawne vp a little from the earth, presently at night it descendeth againe vpon the the earth, and is called Dew, and in the Spring or Haruest, it is a signe of faire weather; but if by meanes of cold it be congealed, it is called Frost, and therefore Dewes come not so often in hote seasons, neither when winds be vp, but after a calme and cleare night, frosts dry vp wet and moisture: For when (as Pliny saith) the Ice is melted, the like quantity of water in proportion is not found.


Of Winde.
Winde is nothing but many exhalations drawn from the earth and inforced laterally aboue the sun.

Of Sodaine Blasts.

A windy exhalation being throwne downe, and
encompassed (as Pliny saith) in a thin course of cloudes newly ouer-cast comming at some time with such a violence, as it bursts and cleaues a drye cloud in sunder, and makes a storme, of the Greekes called Ecnephias, but when this cleft is not great, but that the windes vs forced to turne round, and role in this discent without lighting, there is made a whirle-puffe, or ghust, called Typhon, which is to say, the storme Ecnephias, sent forth and winding violence, and this winde doth beare many things away with it, changing from place to place; but if the hole in the cloud were great, it is called Turbo, casting downe and ouerthrowing all that is next it. Pliny saith, no Ecnephias commeth with snow, nor no Typhon from the South: some say, vinegar throwne into this wind, breakes the gust.


Of Earth-quakes.
Plenty of windes gotten into the bowels holes and corners of the earth bursting out of the earth, and the earth closing againe, causeth the shaking, or earth-quake, and is a token of insuing warre.

Signes of Earth-quakes.
When waters in well or pits be troubled, and haue a bad sauour, the long absence of ye windes, strange noises, the obscurity or darknesse of the Sunne with clouds, and strangly coloured, etc.



Of Thunder and Lightnings.
When an exhalation hote and dry mixt with moisture, is carried vp into the middle region and there inclosed in the body of a cloud: Now these
two contraries being thus shut or pent vp in one roome together, they fall at variance, whereby the water and fire agree not vntill they haue broken the prison wherein they were pent, so that fire and water flye out of the cloud, the breaking whereof maketh a noise, like the renting of cloath, which we call thunder, and the fire lightning, the thunder being made first, but the lightning first seene, in respect the sight is before the hearing; and of lightnings there be many sorts.
That which is dry burneth not at all, dissipating and dispersing: that which is moist burneth not likewise, but blasts, and altereth the colour: but that which is cleare is of a strange operation, it draweth vessels dry without hurt to the vessell; it melteth mettall in bagges or purses, and hurteth not the bagge or purse, nor the waxe that sealed the bagge hurt; it breaketh the bones, and hurteth not the flesh; and killeth the childe in the wombe, not hurting the mother. Pliny saith, Scythia by reason of cold, and AEgypt by reason of heate, haue seldome lightning.

What things be not hurt with lightning.
It hurteth not ye Lawrel tree, it entreth not past 5 foot into the earth, such that are shadowed with the skinnes of Seales, or Sea-calues, are freed, the Eagle is free, etc. Many other wondrous and strange kind of Meteors bee there in the heauens often times seene, as Comets, burning Dragons, etc. but this volume will not containe an ample discourse thereof.





CHAP. XXVIII. Diuerse signes to prognosticate what weather is towards.
TO begin first with the Sunne, the best prognosticator of all other, if he rise cleare, not fiery red, if he chase the clouds before him into the West; if at Sunne-rising there be a circle about the Sunne, and it vanish equally away, if he be red at setting: all these argue faire wether to insue. But if he be fiery red at his rising, if he shew pale and wan, if at rising hee seeme hollow, if red and blacke cloudes be about him at his rising, or if his raies be red both at a rising and setting, if his beames at a morning or euening be contracted or short, if it raine at Sunne-setting, or his raies looke darke or blew, or gather, if at his rising his beames seeme not bright and cleare, if before his rising the cloudes gather like globes mouing not into the west, if a circle of cloudes appeare incompassing the Sunne, leauing not all his light, if his circle about the Sun be broke, if at his rising hee cast his beames a farre off amongst the cloudes, if he spread his beames before he be vp, if at his setting he be ouercast with a thicke misse: all these signifie wet, and often tempestious wether. Also looke if the circle called Halo, be blacke, for if signifieth raine, and if it breake, winds, from that part as the fraction in the circle respecteth.

Presages by the Moone.
According to the Aegyptians, if on the Prime
day the Moone be faire and bright, it will be faire; if red, windes; if dimme and blackish, fowle wether according to the verse.
Pallidaluna pluit, rubicunda slat, alba serenat.
Marke the typs of her hornes when she is fiue dayes old, with Pl. But best when she is primed, if they be blunt, raine; if pricking vpward, and sharpa-pointed, windes. Pliny saith, these things fall truest vpon the fourth day. If her vpper horne, which bends northwards, bee onely sharpe and pricked, winds from that coast: but if the nether horne be so, windes from the South; if the fourth day after her change she haue a red circle or Halo about her, windes and raine. Varro saith, when the Moone is 4 dayes old, if shee put her hornes direct and straight forth, it is tempest at sea, vnlesse there bee a cleare circle about her: If the one halfe of the full Moone seeme pure, faire wether; if red, windes; if blackish, raine; mistes and cloudes about the Moone haue like effect, as Halo, the more the worse, whilest the new Moone is Croissant and rising with the vpper tip of her horne blackish, telleth of wet after the full: but then other tip being so, raine before the full: and if (as Varro saith) this blackishnesse appeare in the middest of the Moone, raine at the full: a circle about the full Moone declareth windes from that part that the circle is most splendant; if her hornes at her rising shew more grosse and thicke then ordinary, looke for raine plentiously, and that before long: if she appeare not before the Prime, the West winde blowing withall, cold winterlike
wether all that Moone. Lastly with Pliny, there bee 8 points in euery Moone, and so many dayes (according as shee falleth vpon the angles of the Sunne) which many onely obserue, and take their presages of future wetherby, to wit, the 3.7.11.15.19.21.27. and the very day of coniunction.


Presages by the Starres.
Next vnto the Moone we may place ye Starres; if the Starres seeme to shoote, windes from that quarter the Starre came from: the wetter the Spring and Sommer, the dryer the Autumne. Autumne faire and dry bringeth a windy Winter: a circle about any of the other Planets, great showers: if the cloud in Cancer, called Praesepe, or the manger standing betwixt Aselli, or ye little Asses appeare not, though otherwise the aire bee cleare, fowle winterlike wether: if the Northerne of these starres bee hid, great windes from the South, but the other being hid, North-east windes.


Of the Raine-bow.
If two Raine-bowes appeare, raine: a Raine-bow presently after raine, faire wether.

Presages from Thunder and Lightning.

If in sommer there be more thunder then lightning, windes from the coast it thundred; but if the lightning exceed, raine: lightning without thunder, betokens raine and thunder: if it lighten only from the North-west, raine the ensuing day; if from the North, windes thence; if from ye South-North-west,
or full west if lighten, especially in the night, winde and raine from those coasts: morning thunder, windes; but mid-day thunder, raine.


Presages by the Cloudes.
If the racke ride apace in the aire, windes from that coast they come, the worse if it come from the North or South: if at Sunne-set the racks ride on both sides fromwards him, tempest: blacke cloudes flying out of the East, rains at night: but from the west, raine the next day: if the cloudes bee disparkled many together of the East, flying like fleeces of wooll, raine for 3 daies after: when cloudes flye low, seeming to settle vpon the tops of hils, cold wether insueth; but the mountaine tops being faire and cleare, the wether will take vp: if the cloudes seeme full charged, and yet looke white withall, which constitution of the aire is called by some Towers, by others white wether, haile is at hand.
If mistes come downe from the hils, or descend from the Heauens, and settle in the Valleyes, it promiseth faire hot wether: mists in the euening shew a hot day on the morrow. The like when white mistes rise from waters in the Euening.


Prognostications by fires.
From the heauens we will proceed to our common fires.
The fire burning pale, or keeping a huzzing noyse, stormy wether: if the flame of fire or candle mount, winding and wauing, as it were, winds:
the like if the fire or candle goe out of it selfe, or kindle and take fire with much adoe. Further, when you discerne many sparkles gather together in the fire, knitting one to another, the coales hanging to the bottome, or side of the pot newly taken off the fire, the fire raked in the imbers, keepeth a spitting and sparkling from it, if the ashes vpon the earth grow together, or when the liue coale shineth brighter, or burneth more then ordinary: all these be tokens of raine.


Prognostications by water.
If the sea, within the hauen, after the departing of the flood in a low ebbe water be calme, and yet keep a noyse and rumbling within, winde; if it do thus by fits, cold wether and raine; if in a calme season the sea strond, or water-bankes resound or make a noise, great tempest: the like of the sea it selfe; the puffins swimming aboue water, tell of cold wether for many daies: the sea being calme, heauing and puffing vp, sheweth there is great store of winds within her, which will shortly breaks out to a tempest.


Prognostications from Fishes and Fowles.
The Dolphin disporting vpon the waues, foreshewes winds: if they fling and dash the water this and that way, and the sea be rough, faire wether: the Cuttle, or little Calamaria Loligo launcing and flying about the water, the Cockles, or Winckles sticking hard to the grauell, the Seavrchings thrusting themselues into the mudde, or
couered with sand, the croking extraordinary of Frogges, the low flying of Swallowes, the chirping of Sparrowes, the crying of Peacockes and Hearnes, the bathing of Crowes, the stinging of of Flyes and Gnats, the early straggling of Seamewes the proking of their fethers by the Guls, Malards and Duckes, all foreshew winde or raine. Contrary the Water-fowle gather together and combate, or Cranes make haste to flye into the middest of the land, or Cormorants and Guls forsaking the waters, or Cranes soring quietly aloft, or Crowes or Rauens gaying against the Sunne, are all tokens of faire wether. But if the Howlat cry Chi-uit, raine: Rauens crying one to another, as if they sobbed and vexed, clapping themselues with their wings, windes: but doing it by interualles of time, wet and winde: the late returning home of Iacke-dawes, hard wether: also yt working of the spinner, the busie heauing of Moles, the appearing of wormes, Hennes resorting to the roost couered with dust, the Ante busied with her Egges, the Bees in faire wether not wandring farre abroad, Bels heard further then ordinary, the wallowing of dogges, the alteration of the crowing of the Cocke, befoken all fowle wether.


Prognostications of foure-footed Beasts.
The leaping and playing of sheepe, and such small cattell, shew alteration of wether: the crying of Swine, Oxen and beasts licking themselues against the haire, or holding vp their nose and smelling into
to the aire, swine shaking hay, or such like stuffe: beasts eating greedily, or licking their hooues, or sodainly moue here and there: all signifie raine or fowle wether.


Prognostications from woods, stones, etc.
The hearbe Trefoile looketh rough against a tempest, and the leaues thereof will stand staring vp, as if it were afraid thereof. Also if dishes, stones, or such like, sweate or be wet: if wainescot doores that ioyne well, be stubborne to open, if salt dissolue in the salt-saller, or any solid body sweate, looke for great raine: the like is seene by the pissing of Dogges.
If there bee a rumbling noise, or sounding in the mountaines and forrests, or if the leaues of trees flicker and play themselues, no winde stirring, which foretell some change of wether: the like prediction is gathered by the light downe of Poplares or Thistles flying to and fro in the aire: looke what is said of the noise in forrests, vnderstand the same here in vallyes, and in the aire. I cannot stand to runne into an ample discourse of this subiect, lest I driue the quantity of my volume beyond my intent; but they shall be amply handled in a Booke I haue to come forth, called Cosmologia and Meteorologia.




CHAP. XXIX. Of the foure quarters of the yeare, and first of Winter.

VVINTER, the first quarter Astronomical, taketh his beginning when the Sunne entreth into Capricorne, during vntill he haue gone to the latter part of Pisces, it is the coldest time of the yeare, and the colder and dryer the wholsomer, yet ouer much cold killeth trees in a warme region, especially such that bee tender. A warme, and moist Winter is vnwholsome, and an enemy to husbandmen, but reasonable store of snow doth ranken the fields and preserue corne.
The diseases of this quarter bee pushes in the face, leprosie, tooth-ach, red-spots, feuers, the scab, fluxes of bloud by the inferiour parts, paines of the eyes, palsies, gouts, and such like.


Of the Spring.
THe Spring is the most comfortablest quarter in all the yeare, and is of nature warme and moist, for then the Sunne draweth neere to the Zenith, comming towards the starres of a warme nature, and then yt East-winds blow dispearcing the superfluous humors, making the earth apt to bring forth all things, for the good and comfort of man: This quarter beginneth when the Sunne entreth into Aries, at what time
the dayes and nights be equal, and continueth vntill the 12 of Iune, at what time the Sunne hath runne through Aries, Taurus, and Gemini; if the Spring be much moist, the fruite will bee rotten and scarce, but weedes will abound; if hoate, the trees soone bring forth leaues; the fruits of that quarter, as Cheries, etc. will soone be ripe, which being not gathered before their full maturity, will bee subiect to wormes, especially in warme regions, but it is seldome with vs, though frequent in Italy. Roses will bee frome, but not so sweete, and all such things shal better please the sight then yt sent or tast; if it bee cold and dry, there will hoare frosts fall in the end of the quarter, according to the full Moone, the wine and fruits will be scarce; being dry and not hot, fruits will bee scarce but good, with want of graine; if it be cold the fruits will be late riping; if it be wet, with much South wind, and the former Winter dry with Northen winds, the next Summer will happen agues, and bleerenesse, dropping of the eyes, and paine of the bowels. A dry Spring with much Northen winds, and a wet Winter full of Southerne winds going before, causeth women with child to bee deliuered before their time, or to bring forth weake children. Gal. l. 3. Aphor. 3. So that if the quarter vary from his proper nature, the commodities of the earth be made worse and scarce, the ordinary diseases of this quarter bee leaprosies, red spots, tooth-ach, feuers of bloud, pushes or wheales in the face, small-pox, ring-wormes, falling-sickenesse, paines in the throate and necke,
the Kings euill, wens, griefes in the shoulders and armes causes by bloud.


Of Sommer.
SOmmer is of nature hot and dry, like the fiery tryplicity, or like the chollericke; if taketh beginning when ye Sun entreth Cancer, continuing vntil he haue passed ouer Cancer, Leo, and Virgo, and now is rage and choller most abounding, being the hottest time (...) the yeare, but in the begining there rise certain^ ^^arres in Cancer, whose vertue is to make moist, especially Aselli, so that the Sunne comming to them, some raine falleth, to fructify the earth, but comming to Leo, beeing neere Syrius and Procyon, starres of a warme nature, the heat groweth most vehement, to temperate which the Etesian winds blow. Lastly comming to Virgo, which is a barren signe, ye constellation of Arcturus rising, a mittigation of heat is produced, with some raine.
If Sommer be ouer wet, the Sommer fruits shall putrify, and there will bee but small store of graine, there will be many sickenesses: if it be onely dry, there will happen want of graine, and Sommer fruits will be wholsome, the fishes shall die in waters, great sicknesses will happen: if it exceede in heat, many sicknesses also will happen with great store of Sommer friutes: if to conclude it bee cold, the yeare will bee wholsome, but the fruits rotten.
This quarter as it is hot and dry in nature, so
doth it accordingly alter the humors in mans body, bringing all fruits to their ripenesse, cattell to their fatnesse, and men to their wealth, the sicknesses agreeing to the nature thereof, bee griefes and torments about the breast, ribbes, and spleene, pushes, leprosy, and diseases of the face as in the Spring: bleard and sore eyes with other impediments therein, the plurisy, cough, heart and stomacke-aking, sorrow, vexations, feuers of bloud, apostumes, pestilence, feuers, the ianndise, paines in the belly and secret parts, with other infirmities proceeding of melancholy.


Of Autumne.
AUtumne is ye fourth and last quarter Astronomicall, but the third according to our English accompt, by nature is cold and dry, melancholy, like old age, resembling the element of the earth, beginning at the Sunnes first ingresse into Libra, producing thereby a second Equinoctiall, cocquating the daies with the nights, which may also be called our second Spring, making an apt time to take Physicke, bleed, etc. but in that Libra is a signe of the Airy triplicity, there is produced heat with temperate moisture, but comming to Scorpio the aire is made more cold and moist, for Scorpio is of the watry triplicity, but comming to Sagitarius, a signe of the fiery triplicity, accompanied with certaine starres of a warme nature, there is made a restraint of the extremity of wet and cold, for the good of such as sow and plow.

If Autumne be most moist, grapes will be putrified and wine bad, if the end be wet there will be want of fruite the insuing yeare, if the beginning be dry, there will be penuria Milij, if hot many sickenesses and euils; if cold there is losse of haruest fruits in quantity, iuyce and beauty.
The diseases of this quarter properly be paines in the backe, darknesse of sight, retention of vrine, fluxes of bloud, paynes in the backe and priuy parts, with infirmities in the face, as in the Spring, also the canker, fistuloes, emrods, the stone and grauell, feuers of bloud, and impediments in the eies.
And here note that Winter in Latine Hyems, is so called, ab (...) which is dimidium, for the vulgar people doe diuide the yeare into two parts, Sommer and Winter, Winter being ye greater. Ver the Spring, is so called a vireo vires, because then omnia virent all things flourish, Aestas Sommer, is so called ab aestu: which is a feruore, by reason of heat. Lastly Autumnus, Autumne, or Haruest, is so called a bonorum anni augmentatione, or it taketh name with Hipocrates, ab ortu Arcturi, during till the Vespertine setting of the Pleiades, or of Autumnus, which is morbidum, or tempestiuosum: and these foure times be resembled to the foure Regions of the world, to the foure Cardinall winds, to the foure Elements, to the foure quarters, to the foure humors, and to the foure ages, as in the ensuing table.

CHAP. XXX. Certaine predictions of the weather in euery moneth, with necessary abstracts, and the Poeticall rising of the Starres.

Ianuary.
NEw-yeares day in the morning being red portends great tempest and warre: after ryseth Orions girdle Vespertine, troubling the ayre, causing South-west winds, the 10 and 11 day doth Lucida Corona produce by a Vespertine setting, about which time also riseth Asellus and praesepe, great causers of raine the more Iupiter being in moist signes: ye 12 day Asellus riseth Cosmicall, the 13 Praesepe setteth Cosmicall: the 20 the South part of Asellus ryseth Chronicall: the 28 Sirius riseth Vespertinus: the 30 Eagle riseth Cosmicall. All which with Ptolemaeus bring wet and tempest: some say if the Sun shine the 12 of
Ianuary, there shall be much winde, others Prognosticate of Saint Pauls day, saying: if the Sunne shine it is token of a happy yeare, if raine or snow, indifferent: if misty, great death, but if it thunder there will bee great windes and death that yeare.

The Abstract.
Cut timber, ridde fruit trees of superfluous branches, vncouer their rootes, drench weake and sicke cattell, Kyne with veriuce, horses with water and ground malt, fodden witha little bran, dig gardines, lib and geld for rearing.



February.
THe third day Regulus riseth Chronicall, the fourth he setteth Cosmicall, of whom Ptol. saith, the cleare starre in the heart of the Lyon beginning to set, the North winde bloweth, with often raine. Carda. saith it raiseth the South-west windes. The 9 the taile of the Dolphin doth set vespertine, which Ptol. saith bringeth windes and snow, and the more raine the winds being south. Some say thunder vpon Shroue-tuesday foretelleth winde, and store of fruit, and plenty, the Sun-beames being early abroad: others affirme that so much he shineth that day, and the like hoe shineth euery day in Lent.

The Abstract.
Set, cut, and lay quicke-sets and roses, sow,
beanes, pease, and oates, especially the land being cold and stiffe: furnish your gardens with sallads for Sommer.



March.
THe 6 day Vindemiator riseth vespertine, bringing North winds with frost, the 8 riseth the Rammes-horne, snow or raine: the 10 Arcturus riseth Chronicall, causing tempests. Carda: saith, at the vespertine rising of this starre, Swallows be seene, and the Spring commeth. Stadius cap. 7. at the vespertine setting of Arcturus, swallows depart by multitudes, and at his vespertine rising come againe: and this rising bringeth South-west winds, and by-west, blowing commonly 12 daies with raine or haile, ending in the west. Herewith agreeth Ptol. Plin. Stadius, Collumell, and others, especially being furthered with the radiation of the Moone or Mars. The 11 or 12 day Sol entreth Aries, the West windes blow, Storkes come, with Ptol. in Aegypt they came the 17 of May. The 21 Spica Virginis setteth Cosmicall cloudy.
Some say, so many mistes in March, so many hoare frosts after Easter.

The Abstract.
Now (regarding winde and weather) graft, also couer the rootes of your trees opened in December
or Ianuary, with ranke earth: sow pease, beans, oates, parsneps, onions, artichockes, cowcumbers, sage, and mellons; manure barly land, but in cold clay ground sow at the end of the moneth.



Aprill.
THe 17 of Aprill, Augustus terminus Pleiadum, one of the seauen starres riseth Cosmicall, the other following a little after, causing Westwindes: the 22 the South part of Lucida Lancis setteth Cosmicall, often proue king showers of raine. Some say if it raine vpon Ascension day (which sometimes falleth in Aprill) it doth betoken scarrity of all kinde of foode for cattell, but being faire, it signifieth plenty.

The Abstract.
Yet it is good to sow Barley, chiefly in strong land, some kinde of garden-seeds sow now also, as Mellons, Citrions, Cowcumbers, and Artichockes: sow likewise Hempe and Flax, setting some garden-herbes towards the end of the Moneth. Now the time beginneth to barke trees, and to yeeld to good Day-men natures aboundance.



May.
THe fourth of May Sirius, or Canis maior setteth vespertine, tempest from the South and
North-east, and by-north; and as Stadius saith, if the full Moone happen within two daies before or after, it prognosticates blasting to corne, and other flowers. The 6 and 7 Hyades begin to set, the South blowing with raine: So Ptol. speaketh of the setting of the 7 starres. The 9 Pleiades set Chronicall, causing^ South winds, which with Ptol. at last turne into the West. The 11 the Buls Eye setteth: the 18 Procyon setteth Heliacall, making wine rage in Cellers with Stadius. The 23 the Eagle riseth Chronicall, which happening at the new or full Moone, all fruits bee hurt with wormes and Caterpillers with Carda. The 24 the 7 starres rise Cosmicall: the 27 the Buls Eye riseth Cosmicall, both which fore-shew raine, and hurt to vines.
Some say, the Sunne shining vpon the 25 day, wines shall prosper well; also in the end of May Okes begin to beare blossomes, which happening fore-shewes much tallow and fruit.

The Abstract.
In the beginning you may sow Barley, set and sow tender hearbes and seeds, as sweet-Marierome, Sommer-sauory, Basill, etc. Set Stilles to worke, vsing, May deaw therein stirring land for Wheate and Rye.



Iune.
THe 6 day the lesser Dogge setteth vespertine, which happening at the full Moone, hurts all
fruits. Stadius saith if it happen at full Moone, it bringeth mischiefe to sweet flowers and vines, by reason of his burning heate: The 12 Sol enters Cancer, Vine and Oliues flourish: the 16 Arcturus setteth Cosmicall, making the aire intemperate: the 21 ye left side of Orion riseth Cosmicall, raising the West windes. If it raine the 24 day, Hazell-nuts do not prosper.

The Abstract.
Set Gilloflowers and Rosemary, sow Lettuce 3 or 4 dayes after the full, which is also good from February to the end of September: sheare sheep, fetch home fewell, and towards the end of the moneth begin to mow.



July.
THe 2 day riseth Orions Girdle, and is a Criticall day: for if it raine this day it doth continue so often for 4. weeks. Stadius saith, if Iupiter be aspected with Mars, Mercury, or the Sunne at this rising, great tempest is portended at the rising of the great Dogge, and foresheweth Northeast windes, and by-North, corruption of the aire, with the rising of the Etesian windes. The 13 Lucida Coronae. setteth Chronicall: the 23 ye North part of Asellus setteth vespertine, at which time with Ptol. the North-east, and by-East winds blow, as fore-runners of ye Etesian winds,
Carda: these winds, as fore-runners of the rising of the Dogge, blow 8 dayes before, with which Stadius agreeth. Some say, if it be faire 3 Sondayes before S. Iames day, corne wil be good: but wet, corne withereth.

The Abstract.
At the full Moone gather flowers and seedes, and let your flowers rather dry in the shade then the Sunne: for the Sunne draweth away their vertue: but to auoid corruption, before you take them away, let the Sunnes heate be vpon them a while. Take heed of suddaine colds, for nothing sooner breedeth the plague: and therefore to drinke being hot is naught. It were vaine to tell good husbands that it is now fit for them to be in medowes, and else where to prouide for Winter. Therefore I will commend this rime to sluggards and idle persons.


Labour in Sommer, take paines with the Ant,


Else in the Winter, liue cold, and in want.





August.
THe first of August ye great Dogge riseth Cosmicall. Carda. saith at the rising of this starre all liuing creatures bee troubled, and that it is scarce possible that drynesse and sicknesse should not be. Stadius recounts many more enormities, as troubling of wine in Cellars, Dogges going
mad, fluxes of the Seas and waters, death of fishes, with the extremity of heate, especially if Mars or Iupiter be in fiery signes. Diaphanes saith, if at the rising of the great Dogge with the Sunne the Moone be in Aries, it doth presignificate raine and tempest; in Taurus, stormes; in Gemini, pestilence; in Cancer, drynesse; in Leo, burning heat; in Virgo, showers often, with vntimely birth of children; in Libra, great drynesse; in Scorpio, plagues; in Sagittarius or Capricorne, raine and tempest; in Aquarius, drought and sicknesse; in Pisces, raine the insuing yeare: But these Stadius saith be not knowne to him for truths: for he holds them more substantiall that bee taken, Exvarijs commixtionum causis. The 3 day the Eagle setteth Cosmicall, the South-west and bywest windes blowing with great heate. Carda. saith, it raiseth the Etesian windes, which with Ptol. do continue 21 daies: the 8 Regulus riseth Cosmicall, raising North-east, and by-north winds: the 13 day ye great Dogge riseth Heliacall, which limits the beginning of the Grecian yeare, and of this rising be diuers obseruations: if then the heauen bee cloudy and darke, it signifieth a heauy time with plagues, etc. but being faire and cleare, it is good. Also the 13 of August, the Dolphine setteth Cosmicall, bringing raine, and beginning Autumne, according to Ptol. The 24 is S. Bartholomewes day, if the winde change not the following night, the vulgar hold it good. Stadius recounts tempests, with haile, etc. to come from the West, and North-west part, in the end of
August, which often doe hurt.

The Abstract.
Reape Wheate and Rye, sow Winter hearbes in the new Moone: stirre land for Wheate and Rye, and about the end of the Moneth downe with Oates, or before, according to the goodnesse of your soile. Looke more in Iuly.



September.
THe first day of this moneth is Criticall, if it do not raine then, the rest of Autumne is like to bee dry: the 12 day Arcturus riseth Cosmicall, raine: and with Ptol. after two dayes Swallowes leaue to be seene. The 13 day is Equinoctiall, windes from West, North-west: the 17 Lucida Coronae riseth Cosmicall, Ptol. windes turne, troubling the seas with winterly weather. So many dayes old the Moone is on Michaelmas day, so many flouds will happen that Winter.

The Abstract.
Cut downe your Lent-tilling, gather the fruits of your trees, conuerting them to vse, as Crabbes for Veriuice, etc. About the middest of the Moneth sow wheat and Rye in cold and strong land, sow winter parsneps, and Carrots, get hyues, etc.




October.
THe 15 day the Dragons Taile setteth vespertine, after this day wee must expect no more warmenesse: and therefore the Germanes call it den Galen Sommer. The 21 the East windes blow: the 26 the left foot of Orion setteth with the 12 degree of Scorpio: causing often great raine: if leaues now hang vpon the trees, some say it portends a cold winter, or many Caterpillers.

The Abstract.
Sow Wheat and Rye, the sooner the better, for feare of raine. The new Moone maketh a fit time to set and remoue yong trees, as the Plum, Peare, Apple, and Bay-tree, to set Nuts, Akornes, etc. and after the full moone gather your winter fruits.



Nouember.
THe 4 or 5 day the Scorpions heart setteth vespertine, which with Astrologers is a Critical day. The 5 day the Dogge setteth bringing southernly wether: the like iudge of Orion, which setteth about this time. The 8 day Succulae or Hyades sets Cosmicall, frost or raine: the 10 the Pleiades set Cosmicall, if then the heauens bee cloudy it denunciates a wet winter: if day, a
sharpe winter. Pliny saith: Succularum and Pleiadarum occasum terra marique turbidum esse. The 24 Arcturus setteth Heliacall, causing often raine, with Cardanus.

The Abstract.
The time is apt to make Malt, to kill Bacons, to cut Ashes, to sow, if you were too late the last moneth, to set Crabbe-tree stockes, to remoue Trees, as in the last moneth in the increasing of the Moone, but in the wane set beanes, pease, etc. Also now vncouer the rootes of your Apple trees, and so let them rest till March.



December.
THe 6 of December is Dies Nicholai, of which Cardanus thus saith: Proximi septem Dies a. Bruma totidemque ante, raro ventis infestantur: they be called Halcyon dayes. Stadius saith, about the Brumall Solstitiall there doth happen Halcyon or most Tranquill weather: the 26 day the faire starre Arcturus setteth vespertine, and then with Carda. the South winds blow.
Some say, if Christmas day come in the new Moone, it is a token of a good yeare, and so much the better, by how much it is neerer the new Moone, the contrary happeneth in the decrease.


The Abstract.
The time is good to fall timber, to vncouer the roots of Apple-trees, to fallow land for Barley, to set beanes, pease, etc. the wether being not too hard: and now Fowlers be busie with Limetwigges, and other engines to take Fowles. Let a warme fire be thy bathe, the Kitchin thy Apothecaries shop, and good hoat meate thy dyet, to which according to thy ability, inuite thy neighbour. Therefore to conclude,


If thou be poore, and canst not feast at all,


Go feast with such as shall to feasting call.






CHAP. XXXI. Predictions of euery day more particularly.
TO giue you iudgement of the temperature of euery particular day, there must be great care had, and many things obserued, as the quality of the signe, the Lord of the lunation, the quality of the Absids, and of the Planets: for there is no great change of wether vnlesse Saturne, Iupiter, or Mars be aspected: also the meeting of the planets, and mingling of their vertue with the Fixed Starres, whose nature and magnitude are duely to bee obserued: the want, or not obseruing of these, and many other which appertaine to preiudications, cause our ordinary and common Prognosticators so grosly to erre, as I noted in my Almanacke 1608: for as I said there, so must I heere also: Qui non potest in singulos dies de pruina niue
grandine etc. Distincte praedicere, huic praedicenti abundantiam aut penuriam frugum, nequaquam fides adhibenda est. Ouer and beside what is said, the aspects of the Planets amongst themselues are most heedfully to be regarded, euen as in the ensuing Table, set in Latine for the more breuity.

Ouer and besides these aspects you must likewise note the mansion that the Moone is in, as in the 24 chapter, so shall you (conferring these things together) produce more substantiall preiudications, but indeed here is no place amply to deliuer such rules yt should bee obserued before (according to Art) you can bee able to giue iudgement of any one day, for I let passe all in resepect of the vnaptnesse of the volume.


CHAP. XXXII. Of the Golden number, Circle of the Sunne, Dominicall letter, and Epact, etc.
THe golden number is a Periodicall reuolution of 19 of our ciuill yeares, in which time the old Phylosophers thought that all the lunations or aspects betwixt the Sun and Moone, returned to the same place they were at 19 yeares before, for in that space the Dragons head made a Periodicall reuolution, but this is not so, for in 19 yeares there is an Anticipation of an houre and a halfe very neere, wanting but 75 seconds, so that looke what coniunction hapned this yeare in Aries at noone, shall fall 19 yeares hence, one houre and halfe before: this Circle is called Decem-nouenalis Circulus, whose parts bee called the golden number: for that it was writ in golden characters in Tables of siluer, and so sent to Rome, or for that they bee written in red or golden leters in the Kalender, and is found thus.

Adde to the yeare of our Lord 1. (for so much was the Prime when Christ was borne) which diuide by 19, the remainder is the Prime or Golden number.

Of the Epact.
THe Epact is nothing else but a number of 11 daies, which the common solar yeare doth exceed the common Lunar yeare, ye one consisting of 365 dayes, the other of 354 daies, and therefore they adde that excesse vnto ye Lunar yeare, to coequal the^, for Epactae with ye Greekes fro^ (...), which signifieth intercalare, or addere, by the addition of which excesse in euery foure yeares, there is gotten a number more then 30, which is greater then the Epact can bee, because from change to change there can be but 30 dayes: therefore 30 must be taken from that excesse, and the remainder is the Epact for the next yeare, as 1611 the Epact is 26 to which adde 11, so haue you 37, from which take 30, and you haue 7 the Epact 1612.
To get the Epact for euer, doe therefore thus, multiply the Prime by 11, parting the product by 30, so is the remainder the Epact; or as is said, adde 11 to the Epact of this yeare, so haue you ye Epact of the next, or see the age of the Moone ye 11 Calends of Aprill, for that is the number of the Epact.
But because I will ease you of calculation, see the ensuing Table, which sheweth you in perpetuall
the Concordancy betwixt the Prime and ye Epact, so that hauing one, you may find the other answering thereunto, and for your further ease I haue added the yeares of our Lord to it: hauing the yeare of our Lord, vnder it in order you haue the Prime and Epact, and when the yeares in this Table be expired, beginne them againe, placing 1631 where 1612 is, etc. so shall your Table bee perpetuall.

Of the Circle of the Sunne, and Dominicall letter, and to find them for euer.
THe Circle of the Sunne, is nothing else but a reuolution of 28 yeares, in which time the Dominical letters make all their seueral changes, and it is called the Circle of the Sunne, not for that it sheweth any motion of the Sunne, but because by meanes thereof the letter Dominicall is alwaies found as we had a circle called Cyclus lunaris, by reason of the office it had, because it was first inuented
ad monstrandas lunationes, so this is called the Solar Circle, or rather in English, the Sunday Circle, because it comprehends all the varieties and changes that the Sunday letter can haue, by reason of Byssextile or leap-yeare. In briefe, this Circle is called the Circle of the Sun, because it acquaints you with the Sunday letter, which is the day of the Sunne.
To finde the Circle of the Sunne, either in the old or new Kalender do thus, adde to the yeare of our Lord proposed 9 (for our Sauiour was borne when ye number was 9) which parted by 28 (as by ye number of yeares of the whole circle) so shall the quotient shew you yt number of reuolutions of ye said circle, and the remainder the circle of the Sun.


Of the Dominicall letter.
THe Dominicall letter is alwaies one of these seuen letters ABCDEFG, and doth shew ye Sunday letter, or day of the Sunne all the yeare, vnlesse it be in Byssextile or leap-yeare, for then there be two Dominicall letters, whereof the first of the two in this Table serueth from the beginning of January, to Saint Mathias eue, and the other to the yeares end, but for your more ease behold the ensuing Table, where the Circle of the Sunne and Sunday letter are placed vnder the yeare of our Lord, and when the yeares of this Table be expired, set 1641 where 1612 is, so will your table be perpetuall, if you proceed as before.

Note if it bee leape-yeare the first of the two letters beginnes the yeare.
Also note the Epact changeth alwaies the first of March, and the Dominicall letter and Prime, etc. the first of January.


Of the Romane indiction.
Wee haue no great vse of this circle in England, it is vsed of the Bishops of Rome in ye instruments and writings of their Pronotations, imitating thereby the old Romanes, though theirs were to another purpose, as to beare account of the payment of trybute: it is a number of 15 yeare, but for that it stands vs to little purpose in
England, briefly find it thus.
Adde to the yeare of our Lord 3, and diuide the product by 15, so shall the remainder be the number of the said indiction, and this indiction is counted from September, not from March.


To get the Age, Change, Full, and Quarters of the Moone.
TO find the age of ye Moone you must haue 3 things, as the Epact, the number of moneths from March to your proposed moneth inclusiuely, and the day of the moneth, these three summes had, adde them altogether, so haue you ye age of the Moone, but if the summe exceed 30, substract 30, and that which you leaue is the age: this is meant if the moneth, wherein the question was made, haue 31 daies, for hauing lesse you must take away but 29 as oft as you may.
Now if you know the age of the Moone any moneth this yeare, and would know how old she shall bee the same day the next yeare, you must adde to her present age 11, so haue you her age the same day of the moneth the ensuing yeare, and to that age adde 11, so haue you her age the second yeare ensuing, and so infinitely, remembring to reiect 30 as before.
Likewise if you desire to know the age of the Moone in the yeare last past, that is all found by addition, of 19 as before by 11, remembring the reiection of 30.


To finde the new, full, and quarters of the Moone.
MArtin Cortez teacheth rules to find the day of coniunction, but they bee not so true as that of Gemma Frisius, which is thus: adde to the Epact the number of monethes from March to ye proposed moneth, including the said moneth, the which taken from 30, the remainder sheweth the day of the change, but if the summe of addition exceed 30, you were best to substract from 59, so is the remainder the day of the change, in which point Gemma Frisius left vs destitute: the change had, the full Moone is found by the addition of 15 daies, and so by addition of 7 daies and 9 houres, to the new or full Moone, you haue the first or last quarter.


To finde the new or full Moone more exactly by my new Tables.
THese briefe rules that the ancient Astronomers haue taught, and the moderne obseruers corrected, howbeit they were singular in respect of the inuention, yet doe they faile a day at least, especially when the Epact is aboue 26: wherefore you shall haue the day, houre and minute of the change and full Moone set in my Kalender and truely verified till 1630, which by the ensuing rules will serue perpetually, the vse whereof is thus.

Consider if you seeke the change or full Moone, for they haue Primes both in seuerall columnes vpon ye left hand vnder this title Prim. @ Prim. @^ therefore when you know what the Prime is for the proposed yeare, seeke the same in one of the rowes of Primes descending, and note against what day of the Moneth it stands,: for that is the day of the change or full Moone, according to the Prime you tooke: then in the row vnder New or Full Moone is the houre and minute of change, or opposition, noted with this letter A, or P, signifying that it happened before or after noone, according to the letter there placed.

Example.

1612 the Prime is 17, and I desire to know what day and houre the change and full moone shal fall on in August: First therefore for the New Moone, I find the Prime 17, in the row vpon the left hand vnder the title Prim. @, which stands against the 16 day of the Moneth, therefore the change was the 16 day: then against 17, vnder the title New Moone, is 11.6. A. which signifieth that the new Moone, which happened the 16 day, was at 11 of the clocke, and 6 minutes before Noone.


Now for the full Moone in August, I seeke the Prime for that proposed yeare, vnder the proper title of Prim. @, which you shall finde to stand against the 31 day, and then vnder the title of Full Moone, is 3.49. A, whereby (as before) you may conclude, that the Full Moone in August 1612, will be the 31 day, at 3 of the clocke, and 49 minutes before noone.


And here note, against some Primes you shall finde 16 or 17 houres, or more, with this letter A or P, which signifieth that the Aspect happened so many houres before or after high Noone of the same day.
Now if you would know any of these Aspects after 1630, you must substract 1 houre and 30 minutes from the time of the happening of the Aspect, and when you haue done so 19 yeares, then substract 3 houres, and so forth, alwaies subtracting 1 houre and 30 minuts for euery 19 yeares: hereby will those Tables be made more true perpetually, then any that yet were euer extant.





CHAP. XXXIIII. To finde what signe the Sunne or Moone is in.
TO finde the signe that the Moone is in, Ioan, de Sacro Bosco saith thus: Multiply the age of the Moone by 4, parting the product by 10, so shall the quotient shew you ye number of signes that the Moone is distant from the Sunne: then the ramainder multiplied by 3, noteth to you the degree of the signe that the Moone is in: Therefore finde the place of the Sunne, as hereafter, and from thence count the signes and degrees before found, and where it ends, is the place of the Moone: but this rule is not precise, and besides, is tedious for the vulgar.


To know what signe the Moone is in by my new Tables.
FOr this purpose there be so many Tables out, and they subiect vnto much errour, that if the Moone do worke in these inferiour bodyes, as Pliny affirmes, lib. 2. chap. 99, or alter the humors thereof according to her place in the Zodiacke, as the learned teach, and experience confirmes: then vaine and vnnecessary be those Tables, that so lead the vulgar into such errours and abuses: for either it is necessary that her true place bee knowne, or needlesse to bee sought: if needlesse, what needeth any obseruation at all? if necessary, how do they beguile them that put trust therein? For the Sheep-heards Kalender, Generall Prognostication, Computation, and such like bookes, suppose the Moone neuer to her slow motion, but when she is in Cancer, Scorpio, or Pisces, which is extreamly false: for you shall perceiue her stay: dayes in the other signes, if you peruse my Tables, as in Aries, Taurus, or Gemini, etc. which their Tables will not allow: which errour is like that of Pliny, lib. 2. chap. 17, saying, that ye Moone entreth not twise in coniunction with the Sun, in any other signe but Gemini, which is not so, as in the yeare 1609, and 1612, in August and September, there bee coniunctions in Virgo, as in Aprill and May 1610 in Taurus. Also hee saith, there is neuer any coniunction of the Sunne and Moone in Sagittarius, the contrary is 1613, in
December, and 1614 in Nouember: Therefore to finde what signe the Moone precisely is in euery day in the yeare, till 1630, do thus; Get ye Prime as before, and then resort vnto your Kalender, finding the Moneth, and the Prime in the head of the Table for that moneth: Now descending downe ye Columne, which is vnder your Prime, vntil you come against the day of the moneth, there shall you finde against the said day of the moueth, the true signe that the Moone is in that day.

Example.

1612 the Prime is 17, and I desire to know what signe the Moone is in the 7 day of May; I therefore descend the Columne vnder 17, vntill I come against the 7 day, which stands vpon the left hand the Table, there I finde @. I conclude the Moone is then in Sagittarius: then the 8 day in @, Capricorne: but the Computation, and the rest of the bookes say, the 8 day in Sagittarius, which is false. Lastly, ouer each of my Tables for the Moone, is placed the nature of the signe she is in.




To know what signe the Sunne is in.
The Degree and Signe that the Sunne is in, stands in the last columne in the former Table, for the place of the Moone vpon the right hand, against the day of the moneth, and vnder this Title @ place.




CHAP. XXXV. Of the Eclipses of the Sunne and Moone, and to know when they shall happen, and the quantity of obscuration.
THe Eclipse of the Sunne is nothing else but the conueying of the Moone (which is a darke body) betwixt our sight and the Sunne, insomuch that the Sunne looseth no light, but onely wee are depriued of the same, in respect of the interposition of the Moone; and this neuer happeneth but when the Sunne and Moone be in a visible coniunction: for you haue your meane, true and visible coniunction, the which true and visible coniunction alwaies happen together when the Sunne and Moone haue no paralax, which is when they bee in coniunction in the 90 degree: s^^ that the further the true coniunction is from the 90 degree, the greater is the difference of these two coniunctions: so that you can haue no eclipse of the Sunne, but when the visible coniunction is neere the Nodes.
Now all eclipses of the Sunne beeither totall without duration, which happeneth when the Moone hath no apparent latitude at the time of ye visible coniunction, or partiall, which duration, may happen three manner of waies: First, when the diameter is only darkened as when the apparent latitude of ye Moone is equal to her apparent semidiameter. Secondly, when there is more then his semidiameter darkened, as when the
Moones apparent latitude is lesse then her apparent semidiameter: And lastly, when there is lesse then the Sunnes diameter darkened, as when the apparent latitude of the Moone is greater then her apparent semidiameter; and you shall know if the apparent latitude of the Moone exceede 34 minutes, 51 seconds, the Sunne cannot be any thing eclipsed, and the greatest eclipse the Sunne can suffer, is when he is in the Auge of his Eccentricke, and in his greatest eccentricity, and the Moone in her opposite Auge, whereby such places that bee sytuate within the compasse of the Moones shadow, may loose the whele light of the Sunne, the diameter whereof doth containe 280 of our English miles, or thereabouts. Further it may so fall out, that you shall see the whole body of the Moone within the compasse of the Sunne, the Sunne seeming to loose his light in the very middest, and about the same will appeare a narrow shining circle, of three quarters of an inch in bredth, which happeneth when the Moone is in her Auge, and the Sunne in his least eccentricity, and in oppost Auge: but this discourse is not fit for this volume, therefore to the matter.

To finde the Eclipse of the Sunne.
You must know that the body of the Sunne is supposed to be diuided into 12 Digits, and that hee is neuer eclipsed but at the new Moone: therefore finde the new Moone, as you bee taught before, and then in the row vpon your left hand, vnder the title Digits @, see if there stand any figure against
the same, for then may you conclude the Sunne to be Eclipsed, the same houre that ye new Moone happens, and that there be so many parts of his body darkened, as the figures vuder Digits @ expresse.

Example.

1612. In May I finde the new Moone to happen the 20 day, at 5 of the clocke, and 43 min. before Noone: then against the same, vnder Digits @, stands 8/12, therefore I conclude that the Sun shall be eclips^^ at that houre, 8 parts and a halfe, and if there ^ad stood such a marke as this (^) he had bene eclipsed, though not visible in our Horizon.

After the same order may you finde what e^^ipses happen any day of any moneth for any yeare to come, or thus: seeke vnder the title of Digits @ what figures stand there, and what Primes answere thereunto, then finde the said Primes in the little Table before, and ouer the head thereof is the yeare of our Lord God.



Of the Eclypses of the Moone.
To speake properly of an Eclypse, it is an obscuration of light in the Sunne, and a defection of the Moone: for the Moone is a darke and grosse body, hauing no light but such that thee receineth of the Sunne, whereby she is neuer eclipsed, but at such time that the earth is betwixt the Sun and her, which chanceth thee beeing at the full diametricall opposite to the Sunne, and some what neere to the head or taile of the Dragon: But these Eclipses of the Moone for diuers causes, be not alwaies after one manner, as first by reason of her
vnequall latitude, which sometime is nothing at all, whereby the eclipse is greater in magnitude, and longer in duration. Another time her latitude is so great, that thee falleth but a little within the shadow of ye earth, loosing but a little light: and sometime she commeth not in the shadow of the earth, and then is not eclipsed: for it is generall, that when the Moones latitude, at a true Opposition, is lesser then the semidiameter of the shadow, and the Moones body both, being set together, that the Moone will be eclipsed, and the more those semidiameters exceed the latitude, the greater is the Eclipse.
Againe, these Eclipses differ in respect of the vnequall thicknesse of the shadow of the earth: for the body of the Sunne (as is said) is greater then the body of the Earth: and therefore the shadow cannot be Cylindricall, or Calathoidall, but onely Conicall, rising beyond the earth, and ending in a point: but for all these and many other causes of the variety of lunar Eclipses, yet we may reduce them for breuities sake, into two principall heads, as Totall and Partile: the Totall is two-sold, as either without continuance of time, loofing all her light but for an instant, because the semidiameter of the earth is as great as the Moones latitude, and her semidiameter: or totall with continuance, loosing all her light for a certaine space, because the semidiameter of the shadow of the earth, in the place of the Eclipse, exceedeth the latitude of the Moone, and her bodily somidiameter.

The Partile Eclipse of ye Moone is when part if the body of the Moone is darkened, whereof there be 3 sorts: first when halfe her diameter is darkened, happening when the latitude of the Moone is equall to the semidiameter of the earths shadow: next when lesse then the semidiameter is darkened, happening when her latitude is more then the semidiameter of ye earths shadow. Thirdly, when more then the Moones semidiameter is obscured, which cometh to passe when the latitude of the Moone is lesse then the semidiameter of the earths shadow.


Of the parts of the Moone Eclipsed.
Like as the body of the Sun, so also the body of ye Moone is imagined to bee diuided into 12 parts, because their diameters appeare as a foot long, so that we say they bee eclipsed so many digits or fingers, but for the Moone by reason of the thicknesse of the shadow of the earth, she may be eclipsed 23 Digits: but I should proue ouer-tedious amply to discourse of these matters: therefore find out her eclipse thus:


To finde the Moones Eclipse.
Finde (as before) at what houre, and what day of the moneth any full Moone happeneth, and there finde the eclipse of the moone, as you did that of the Sunne, remembring alwaies to seeke the moones eclipse vnder the Title Full Moone, and her Eclipse, and the Digits, or parts of her body eclipsed in the row vpon the right hand, vnder Digits @, remembring what is said of the Sunne. This is casie.

The vse of the former Table.
IF you would know at what houre the day breake, the Sunne rise and set, and how long the daies and nights be, and when twi-light ends, do thus:
In the first row vpon your left hand, finde your moneth, and in ye next row rightwards the day of the moneth, which are placed against the moneth three times, thus: 1, 10, 20, and when you want the iust day, take the neerest, for it will serue precise enough: The day of the moneth thus found, proceed rightward against the said day, so shall you see the houre and minute of all the foresaid vnder their proper Titles, and against the said day of the moneth. As the 20 day of August the day breaketh at three of the clocke and 8 minutes, the Sunne riseth at 5 and 18 minutes, the length of the day is 13 houres, and 23 minutes, and so proceed forth.


To finde the houre of the day.
MVltiply the signe of the Sunnes Altitude (taken instrumentally) by the signe of the semidiurnall Arke, diuiding the product by the signe of the Sunnes Meridian altitude, reseruing then the quotient, seeke the arke answering to the same, as you be taught in the'seuenth booke of my Staffe, called Trigonometria, the which arke conuert into houres, as you be also taught in the said
seuenth booke: so haue you the number of houres from Sunne rising, if your obseruations were before noone, or the distance from Sun set, if they were in the afternoone.


Otherwise.
In the ensuing Scheme finde the degree that the Sun is in, in the lowerend thereof, and in the side B A finde the altitude of the Sun, then note where the line passing by the degree of the Sunne paralell to B A, intersects with the line running from the altitude of the Sunne, and paralell to D A, or C B: for the houre-line passing by that intersection is the houre of the day.


Example.

The 21 of Aprill 1612 the Sunne is in the 10 degree of 8, and 30 degrees high, the paralels issuing from which two places, intersect at E, and the houre-line passing by is marked with 8, and 4, so that if your obseruations were before noone, it had beene 8, if after noone 4 of the clocke.

By this means the degree the Sunne is in, and the houre of the day giuen, you may find his altitude the same houre, and contrary: also hereby you may finde the rising and setting of the Sun, etc. and many other pretty conclusions which the ingenious will soone know, and I for breuities take omit.

CAAP. XXXVII. To know how long the Moone shineth, when she riseth and setteth, with the cause of her lesse or greater light.
THe Moone hath no light but what shee receiueth of the Sunne, being a darke and grosse body, as is well manifested in the time of her eclipse, and though the vulgar thinke shee is now partly lightned, and now totall, the imagination is meere false, for she alwaies retaines one and the selfe same quantity of light at her quarters and other aspects, as at the full: for shee is a round Globe, and that part of the globious body that beholdeth the Sunne is alwayes lightened: so that when she is neere the Sunne, the lightned halfe is auerted and turned from vs respectiuely to the Sunne because she commeth more and more vnder the Sunne, receiuing thereby light vpon her vppermost part, which beholdeth the Sunne, and therefore the further she is from the Sunne, the greater is her light, and to know how long shee shineth, do thus:
All the time of her increase multiply her age by 4, but in the decrease, or after the full, see what her age wanteth of 30, the which also multiply by 4, and make partition by 5, the quotient sheweth the number of houres shee shineth after Sun-set, or before his rising. Lastly, the remaineder multiplied by 12 sheweth the minutes to bee added: for alwaies whilest she doth increase, shee
followeth the Sunne, and shineth after Sun-set, her lightned part looking into the West: but decreasing she goeth before the Sunne, and shineth before his rising, her lightned part looking into the East.

To know when the Moone riseth and setteth.
This rule, in respect of the manifold motions of the Moone, but chiefly in respect of her latitude, is not alwaies so precise, they may serue for a shift, and sometime is precise.
Note therefore the length of her shining, as before, and also note if it be in the increase or decrease of the Moone, and then for either worke thus:
All the increase to the houre of Sun rising, adde the quantity of her shining, so haue you her rising: the same quantity adde to the time of Sun-setting, so also haue you her setting.
But after the full, take the quantity of her shining from ye Sun rising, and you haue her rising: the same also taken from Sun-setting, sheweth the time of her setting, and if substraction cannot bee made, borrow 12.
But for such that cannot finde the quantity of her shining Arithmeticall, let them enter the ensuing Table with her age, finding the same in one of the rowes descending, or ascending, in the first columne vpon the left hand, answering to which in the next columne vnder the title, The Moones comming to South, shall you finde the houre and minute of her shining: then for her rising and setting, worke as before.

Note that the houre of the Moones comming to the South is the time of full Sea at South-hampton, Quindborow, and Portsmouth.




Against the age of the Moone in the third row, haue you the time of the full sea in any of the Hauens vpon the right hand: and if you desire to know the high water or time of the Tide in any other Hauen in England, you must adde the houres and minutes placed by the name of each Hauen vnto the houre of the Moones comming to the South: as the Moone being three dates old, commeth to the South at two of the clocke, and 24 minutes: then if you desire the high water at Redban, you must adde 45 minutes more, so haue you 3 of the clocke and 9 minutes.
For the high water at Redban or Aberden adde 45 minutes, for Dundee, S. Andrewes, Silly, 2 houres 15 minutes: for Frith, Leith, Dunbar, 4 houres, 30 minuts: For Flamot 5 houres 15 minutes: for Foy, Lyn, Humber, Waymouth, Dertmouth, Plimouth, 6 houres: For Milford, Bridgewater, 7 houres 30 minutes: For Portland, Peterport, 8 houres 15 minutes: For Orkenpoole, Orwell, 9 houres, Diep, Lux, Lenoys, 9 houres, 45 min. For Bolein, Douer, Harwich, Yarmouth, 10 houres 30 minutes: For Callice, Rye, and Winchelsy, 11 houres, 15 minutes.

To know at what time the Moone will bee full South any day in the yeare.
Seeke her Age in the third Columne, answering to which in the second columne is the houre of her comming to the South, and note all the increase shee commeth to the South after Noone,
that is, vntill she be 15 dayes old, and all the decrease she commeth to the South in the morning.


To know what of the clocke it is in the night by the Moone.
Looke vpon any Sun-dyall, and see what of clocke it is by the shadow of the Moone (as you doe by the Sunne) noting how much it wants or is past 12 of the clacke: for so much it wants or is past the houre of her comming to the South that day, which houre you bee taught in the last note to finde.

Example.
Vpon a certaine day I looked in a Sunne-dyall and found the shadow of the Moone to point at 10 of the clocke, which wanted two houres of 12, the same day I also found her age 9 dayes, and thereby her co^ming to the South was at 7 houres and 12 minutes, therefore it wanted 2 houres of the same: so that it must be 5 of the clocke and 12 minutes past: or if the same day the shadow had beene at 2 after noone, it had beene 2 houres past 7, and 12 minutes, to wit, 9 and 12 minutes: So of the rest.




CHAP. XXXVIII. Astronomicall Elections for physicke and Chirurgery, depending vpon the place, and course of the Moone.
IF thy body be filled with naughty and superfluous humors, then were it connenient for thee
to draw bloud, so the heauens consent thereunto, and thy age agree therewith; which being not circumspectly weighed, it may be most dangerous to the Patient (of which no vnderstanding man is ignorant) but when necessity vrgeth, as for the Pestilence, Plurisie, Phrenzy, etc. then, though the Heauens deny, yet a veine is spcedily to bee opened, ad aegri salutem. This considered of medicines some be purgatiue, some comfortiue and others in the meane betwixt both. Medicines purgatiue be either Soluendo or Leniendo: In the first the Moone must be in Cancer, Scorpio, or Pisces. For the other the moone must bee taken when she worketh more in moistnesse then drynesse, being in a @ or * with Mars; and you must take beed in the houre of giuing the medicine lest the Moone haue any aspect with Saturne: for he congeales the humors, making the medicine worke little: likewise let her bee free from any aspect with Iupiter: for hee is the giuer of life, the helper and comforter of the vertues: so that the medicine can but weakly expell the humors, making the body affected with an euill quality. Further, in all purgatiue medicines obserue the insuing Rules.

The @ in S in @ or @ with @, Purge choler @ not co^bust, With elelectuaries.
The @ in S in @ or @ with @, Purge phlegme. With elelectuaries.
The @ in S in @ or @ with @, Purge the Melancholy. With elelectuaries.
The @ in @ in @ or @ with @, Purge yt cholerick @ non vsta With Potions.
The @ in @ in @ or @ with @, Purge the Plegmatick With Potions.
The @ in @ in @ or @ with @, Purge the melancholy. With Potions.

The @ in @ in @ or @ with @, Purge ye cholericke @ non vsta, With Pils.
The @ in @ in @ or @ with @, Purge the Phlegmaticke. With Pils.
The @ in @ in @ or @ with @, Purge the Melancholy. With Pils.
The @ in @ or @ in @ or @ with @, Purge yt cholerick vt supra with any kinde of medicine.
The @ in @ or @ in @ or @ with @, Purge the Phlegmaticke. with any kinde of medicine.
The @ in @ or @ in @ or @ with @, Purge the Melancholy. with any kinde of medicine.

But let not the Moone be in any of the signes that chaw the Cud, as @, @, @, for then the medicine will stay but a little with the patient, causing him to vomit, vnlesse you intend to purge by vomiting. Also in purging the melancholy let not Saturne haue domunon, nor Iupiter in purging the sanguine, or the liner; nor Mars the cholericke, bitter sweats, etc. nor Luna the head, nor Mercury in purging the lungs.

How the vertues be corroborated.
The vertues be either Vitall, Animall, or Naturall; the Vitall vertues remaine in the heart, the Animall in the braine, and the Naturall in the liuer; the Vitall vertues are gouerned of Sol and Iupiter, the Animal of Luna, Mercury and Venus, and the Naturall of Ioue and Venus.
Other vertues be also gouerned of the planets, as the vertue Attactiue is governed of Sol, the Disgestiue of Ioue, the Retentiue of Saturne, and the Expulsiue of Luna.
Also the signes thus gouerne the vertues, Aries and Sagitarius ruleth the Atractiue, Gemini and Libra the Disgestiue, Taurus and Virgo the Retentiue, and Cancer and Pisces the Expulsiue.

Also the vertues be ruled by the planess thus: Sol the well-spring of the vertues Vitall, Luna of the vertues Animall, Saturne of the Receptiue, Iupiter of the Augmentatiue, Mars of the Attractiue, Venus of the Appetitiue, and Mercury of the Imaginatiue: Therefore when you would fortifie any of these vertues, fortifie the planet signifying the same, and it is done.


Rules for drawing of bloud.

CHAP. XXXIX. Of the moueable Feasts, and diuersities of Easter, with the reason of our difference and the Romanes.
HAuing spoken of the changes of the Moone, etc. It followeth to speake of the moueable Feasts, because they depend thereon, and haue no fixed place in the Kalender, being sixe in number, to wit, Septuagesima, Quadragesima, Easter, Rogation Sunday, Ascension, and Whitsunday.
Septuagesima is so called of 70, as it were containing 70 dayes, which the Church doth obserue in remembrance of the 70 yeares that the children of Israell were vnder the Babylonicall seruitude, and is alwayes three Sundayes before Quadragesima.
Quadragesima is simply said of 40, as containing 40 daies, which the Church recounts in remembrance of the 40 daies that Moses fasted, when he receiued the Lawes of our Lord, Elias fasted so many daies, and so many daies fasted Christ before the tempter came; and because the actions of Christ should be instructions to vs, therefore we should endeuour to fast so many daies.
Easter is the principall of all other Feasts and so ordained by God at first, and at this day there bee three sorts, that is, Pascha Hebraeorum, the Iewes Easter, Pascha Verum, our Easter, and Pascha Nouum, the Romanes Easter.

The Iewes Easter was commanded to be kept the 14 day of the first moneth, called Abib, which day at Euen was the Lords Passouer, and the 15 day should be the holy Conuocation, as you may see, Exod. chap. 12. verse 18. Leuit. 23.5. Deut. 16.1. Numb. 28.16. Esdras. 7.10. And this 15 day is taken for the first day after the first full Moone, happening after the Spring Equinoctial: which institution the Iewes altered, holding a superstitious opinion of daies, and thereby would not keepe their Easter vpon a Munday, Wednesday, or Friday, breaking thereby the commandedament of God like stiffe-necked people, as in the 2 booke of the Kings. chap. 23. v. 22.
Our Easter was ordained 322 yeares after the Incarnation: for Constantinus Magnus noting the errors risen amongst the congregation of the Christians and the many contentions that continually rose after the Apostles time about the celebration of Easter, assembled from all Nations; 18 Bishops and other learned, as wel Greeks as Latins and AEgyptians, such that could withall well determine of the motions of ye celestial bodies: Amo^gst whom was Eusebius, Bishop of Caesaria chiefe, being an excellent Mathematitian, and hee kept them there two yeares vpon his owne cost and charges, and so 323 after the Incarnation there was a new Decemnouall, or Golden Number instituted, differing from that the Romanes then vsed, which made it the longer before they would consent vnto it: for by this new Circle Easter should be celebrated vpon the Sunday next
following the first fuil Moone that should happen after the entrance of the Sunne into Aries, and this new institution continued not passing seauen yeares after the Nicene Councell: for in 330 there fell differences betwixt the Romanes and the Greekes about the same, which continued neers 200 yeares: and then in the time of Iustinianus the Emperour, Dionysius Abbas, a worthy Romane, Anno 527, began to draw Paschall Tables, and Rules Ecclesiasticall, according as it was ordained at the former Councell, which he finished Anno 532, and then at a Counceil at Calcedon it was established, that whosoeuer held any other Easter then that after the statutes of Rome, should ber counted an hereticke, and therefore till 1582, no man durst presume to alter the Easter, though they saw the Equinoctium still flye backwards from the 21 of March, insomuch that it is now about the 11, day, by reason of which anticipation sometimes there happens two full Moones before wee can keepe our Easter, which was a cause the Romanes altered their Kalender, and thereby is there 28 daies difference sometimes betwixt vs and them, as in Anno 1557, 60, 71, 84. and 87, also there may happen 35 dayes, as in Anno 1565, 68, 76, 79, in all which yeares there happens two full moones betwixt our Easter, and the Spring Equinoctiall, so did it 1595, and farre more late, as 1603, and so shall it 1622, the which inconuenience the Romanes finding, reformed their Paschall Tables, whereby they produce Easter alwayes the Sunday
following the first full moone, according to the foresaid first generall Councell held at Nice in Pontus 322 yeares after the Incarnation: But now whether it be best for vs to alter our Tables and Kalender according to that Councell, I will not presume to argue: if some say all Christians vsed this wee doe 1055 yeares, I answere, the Nicene Councel made no respect of the smal want that the day in cucry Leape yeare wanted of 24 houres, being but 47 minutes, 12 seconds, as in the 21 Chapter: but since there is passed 1289 yeares this present yeare 1611. whereby the Equinoctiall is gone before the 21 of March (as it was then obserued) 10 dayes, and this is the cause of the difference betwixt vs and the Romanes, whereby the Astronomers are forced in their Registers to distinguish thus betwixt vs and them, Annus Nouus and Vetus, and so of the Kalender, and of Easter, and the other moueable feasts, as before, but this volume is too short for an ample discourse.
Now Easter hath diuers names, according vnto the diuersity of Nations, with the Hebrewes it is called Pascha, with the Greekes, Basis, and with the Latines Transitus, with vs Easter.
Rogation Sunday is so called, because nos rogat Ecclesia, the Church commanded vs to contiune fasting, processions, and praiers as well against the bodily Woolues, such as late were in ^^tance, as also against the spirituall Woolues.
Pentecoste is so called from (...), which
is Quinquagesimus, because there be 50 dayes betwixt Easter and Whitsunday inclustuely, and this time the Church doth obserue in reme^brance of the Law giuen vnto Moses in the burning mount, as also in memoriall of the Holy Ghost, that appeared to the Apostles like clouen tongues as you may read Acts 2.1.
And these be called moueable Feasts for that they haue not any fixed place in the Kalender, by reason of the celebration of Easter, whereupon the finding of all the rest depend.


CHAP. XL. To finde all the moueable Feasts for cuer according to our English Kalender.
ENter this Table seeking the Golden Number in the first row descending vpon the left hand, which hauing found, proceed directly vnto the right hand, vntill you comme vnder the Dominicall letter for the proposed yeare: so shall the number in the common angle shew you the number of we^eks of Interuallum Minus, and the number iust ouer the Dominical Letter, are odde daies to be added, which is the distance of weeks and dayes betwixt the birth of our Lord, and Quinquagesima, or Esto mihi, which is Shroue-sunday.

One thing note in the vse of this Table, that ye Leap-yeare hath two Letters, as GF, BA, DC, FE, AG, CB, or ED, the first of these alwaies beginning the yeare, as in Chap. 30. but you must enter this Table with the later.


To finde the Moueable Feasts otherwise.
Seeke the change of the Moone in February, for that yeare, as in Chap. 31. the next Tuesday after is Shroue-tuesday, but if the change be vpon Tuesday, then the next Tuesday following is Shroue-tuesday, then the next Sunday is the first Sunday in Lent, six Sundayes after is Easter day, to which adde 5 weekes, so haue you Rogation Sunday, then is it foure daies more to Ascension day, from which proceed forwards 10 dayes for Whitsunday, the next Sunday after is Trinity Sunday, and the next Thursday, Corpus Christi day.



CHAP. XLI. To finde the Moueable feasts according to the Romane Church.
THe Romans say they do obserue their Easter and yt moueable feasts both according to Gods commandement, and according to the Edict in the Councel of Trent: the truth thereof I leaue to the learned, and here set downe how to finde it for Merchants and others that haue to doe beyond the seas.
To haue their Easter, you must first finde the
Epact, (for they haue reiected the Golden Number in that behalfe) and yet doth their Epact often misse a day, sometimes two, and seldome hit truly the day of the new Moone, euen as with vs it doth.
But to find the first find the Golden Number in the insuing Table, vnder it is the Epact.

And this is a perfect agreement of the Prime and Epact in the new Romane Kalender, and is true vntill 1700. And for your more ease I haue added the yeare of our Lord God vnto 1630, so yt knowing what yeare of our Lord it is, you haue vnder it both the Prime and Epact, and when these yeares of our Lord God be expired, then set 1631 where 1612 is, and 1632 where 1613 is, and so proceede, whereby you make your Table serue so long as the Epact and Prime agree which is vntill 1700 be past: or take 10 from our Epact found, Chap. 30. so haue you the Romane Epact till 1700, after which time deduct 11 for the correption of the yeares.
Now to finde the moueable feasts according to the Romanes, do thus: First, finde the Epact, as before, and then the Dominicall Letter for the

CHAP. XLII. Of the Ember and Fasting-daies, as also of the times of Mariage.
THere be foure times in the yeare called Anni quatuor tempora, which the Church hath appointed for Ieiuniall or fasting dayee, euery of which times containeth three daies, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday: two of which fasts depends on dayes fixed, the other vpon dayes moueable: First, we fast in the Spring to the end as all things then flourish, so may also the workes of men: in Sommer, that we may be in charity: in Autumne, that we may bring forth the fruits of good workes: and in winter, that as the leaues fall from the trees, and small hearhes dye, so vice may be killed in vs, and superfluities fall from vs: Or we rast to temperate and moderate the humour predominating that quarter, as Choler in Sommer, etc. as in Chap. 27. the which fasting dayes be
The Wednesday, Friday and Saturday after Quadragesima,The Wednesday, Friday and Saturday after Whitsunday,The Wednesday, Friday and Saturday after Holy Crosse.The Wednesday, Friday and Saturday after Saint Lucies day.

But if Holy Crosse, or S. Lucies day fall vpon a Wednesday, then take the Wednesday following: as for other fasting dayes, they be noted in the Kalender. And the cause wherefore the Romanes and we obserue no fasting day, betwixt the Resurrection and Ascension day is (as I take it) grounded vpon this Text: Can the children of the Mariage Chamber fast whilst the Bridegrome is with them, etc. Mark. 2.19.

Times prohibited from Marriage.
from after Adue^tsunday after Septuagesima 3 dayes before the Ascension. till 8 daies after the Epiphany.
from after Adue^tsunday after Septuagesima 3 dayes before the Ascension. till 8 do. after Easter Trinity Sunday.

Of the Dimensions of England, and other parts of the World, according to other Authors.
BRITAINE, as M. Pitheas, and Isidorus report, is in compasse, 3825. miles, which is false, but Pliny saith, when this Dimension was taken, the Romanes had knowledge but to the Forest called Caledonia. Agrippa saith, it is in lenghth, 800. miles, and in bredth, 300. miles, and that Ireland is as broad, but not so long by 200. miles. Some of our owne Countrimen haue published the compasse of England to be 4340 miles, and that ye length from Barwicke to Portsmouth, is 320 miles, and the bredth in the brodest place, which is from Douer (or rather from Sandwich) 300. miles but it is not so much, as you may gather by my dimensions before, which be truly set downe.

Of Europe.
Pliny, Lib. 6. Chap. 31. saith, that Europe is in length 3748. miles, and that the bredth at the broadest is 250. miles. Agrippa would haue it 910 from the bounds of Cyrene, ending at the Garamantes: for so farre to them was knowne and discouered.



Of Asia.
Pliny also saith, that Asia is in length, 63750 miles, and in bredth from the Aethiopian Sea, to Alexandria, situate vpon Nilus, 1875. and that Europe is scarce halfe so bigge as Asia.
Also, that Europe is twice as much as Affrica, and a sixth part ouer: so that by Plinies Computation, in reducing all these parts together, Europe is a third part of the Earth, and an eighth portion ouer, and Asia a fourth part, and one 14 portion, and Affrica a fifth part, with an ouerplus of a 16 portion.
But the ignorance of these Authors is herein to bee excused, in respect it is not so now: For since their time our Trauellers haue found out, as it were, a new world, of which they were ignorant of, imagining no such thing, to wit, America, and Magellana, so that as they before diuided the world into three parts, now bee there flue such parts: but Pliny (like the Author of such another great English volume) was forward to write much vpon reports, and that of the meanest, as Hunters, Fowlers, Sheepheards, etc. And therefore since hath beene called by some, Rusticus Mendax. But as his workes hee learned (though much matter impertinent, and erroneous) so is he in many things excuseable. As for Europe, it now consists of aboue 28. Kingdomes, beside the Romane Empire. In length it containeth from the Cape of Portingale to the riuer
Taneus 3800. miles, and in bredth, from the Archipellago to the Frise Ocean, 1200. miles, and is wasted vpon the westerne and Northerne part, partly by the Ocean, and partly by the Balthean Seas: as for the other foure parts of the world, I cannot here stand further to speake of them.

CHAP. XLVII. Of the degrees of men before the Conquest.
THe first was a Hertzoge, which was the Constable of England, and now in the Norman tongue, he is called a Duke.
The next in the Saxons speech was a Markenriue, which is called a Marques in the Brittish tongue, and was chiefe in the horse campe.
The next in the Saxons speech was an Elderman, which is now called an Earle, and hee was Iudge in the County where hee dwelt, and had the third part of the profits of the County-Court towards his paines and charges.
The next in the Saxons time was a Vicecount, who in the absence of the Elder-man did execute iustice, and in ye Norman speech was called a Vicecount, and is now called a Sherife, or Reaue of the Shire.
The next in the Saxons speech was a Thayne, which in the Brittish tongue is interpreted a Dynast, and in the Norman speech a Baron, and in Latine is Thanus.
The next degree was a Vauasour, which is now called a Knight Barronet, and he had his Mannor place where he kept his Courts.
The next in the Brittish tongue was a Norghough, which after the Danish speech was called a Knight.
The next degree was the Edleman, which wee now call the Gentleman. I reade not of Esquires,
vnlesse it were Laueffer, which the Linguists doe rather interprete a Pursiuant.
The next in the Saxons time was a Boclandman, which the Danes called a Swaine, and is now a Charterer, or Free-holder.
The next in the Saxons time was Gebures, which we call Husbandmen.
There is a degree called a Farmer, which properly is, as (some thinke) where a man letteth out land for a certaine time for meats and drinke, as you may read yt Canutus Rex dedit firmario Ecclesiae de Glastenbury vnam hidam terrae, etc. And this was onely for the reliefe of old sickly Monkes: but hee is now a Farmer that can get a good liuing, and pay but a little for it to the Lord.
There is yet another degree called Hlafordines, the which were bond-men and are now Copyholders, and their Lords were taled Hlafords.

before Earles, no more then the eldest sonnes of Earles be Uicecounts; as for the rest of any of their sons, they be by rigor of the law but Esquiers.

Of Women.
The estate of women is such, by the curtesie of England, that if they get to any degree of estate, they neuer loose it, though they marry more basely, and yet are capable of a higher degree, as a Lady marrying with a gentleman, taketh place as a Lady, according to the estate of her Lord or knight that was her first husband, so likewise of a Dutches, etc. But if they debase themselues ouermuch, as to marry with a Clowne, or one of base parentage, then they bee not so much esteemed amongst the better sort, though of curtesie they affoord her a place.

Note in the reading of these briefe Chronicle Notes, at the end of many of them you shall haue certaine figures set, which signifies the yeare of the King it happened in; because sometime the accident was not in that regnal yeare that stands against the Eclesian yeare.


The Description and vse of this New Table, called A Concordancy of Yeares.
THis my Concordancy of Yeares, hath in euery page 5 seuerall rowes, vnder seuerall Titles, as the first row is vnder the Yeare of our Lord, beginning at 1066. at what time the Conqueror began, and so continuing to the yeare 1646. The next row is vnder post Conquestu^, shewing how many yeares any yeare of our Lord, or any yeare of any King was after the Conquest. The third is vnder Kings Reigne, shewing how the yeares of the Kings answere to the yeares of our Lord. The fourth is vnder Time expired, shewing
how many yeares it is since any of the yeares placed in any of the 3 former rowes, at this present yeare 1612. And the last row is placed vnder the Title of Easter day, shewing what day of the moneth Easter day fell vpon any yeare since the Conquest, to the yeare 1646. In which row also be certaine Capitall letters placed, which bee the later of the Dominicall letters in the Leape-yeare, as in Chap. 21.
Now these things considered, you are to vnderstand, that all the difficulty in computating of time is when the question is onely propounded by the yeare of the Kings reigne, and therefore if you can deuise when any question is made by any yeare of any King, to know in what yeare of our Lord it was, then the labour is nothing: for you must know, that euery yeare, of any King as yet, began in one yeare of the Lord, and ended in ye next insuing yeare which is the cause of this difference. But to make all more plaine, I will propound certaine examples both of the yeare of our Lord, and of the regnall yeare.

Quest. 1 I haue a Lease for an hundred yeares, bearing date in Aprill 1514, and I would know this yeare 1612. what time I haue remaining.

ANSVVERE.

Seeke first the yeare of our Lord, 1514, and their begin to tell at the next yeare forwards, calling 1515. one, 1516. two, and so proceed, vntill you come to 1612: so shall you count to the number
of 98 yeares, and so many of your 100 yeares be expired: But in the numbring thus, you must remember, that before and after the change of euery Prince, one and the same yeare of our Lord is twice placed, therefore omit the one in your reckoning.
Or take 1514 out of 1612, so haue you 98 years: Or seeke (with more ease) in the third row vnder Time expired, what figures stand against 1514, so shall you finde 98, as before, and so many yeares be expired, 1612. But if you had sought this any other yeare after 1612. as 1614, then must you haue seene what figures in ye fift row had beene against 1614, as 2, the which 2 must haue beene added to 98: so had you 100 yeares. The like for any other yeare after, to 1646.


Quest. 2. I haue a Lease granted for 60 yeares, bearing date the 8 of Ianuary, in the 6 yeare of Edward the 6. and I would know this yeare 1612, how many years be expired.

ANSVVER.

You must note first that the regnal yeares stand periodicall, or compleat, against the yeares of our Lord: so that the yeare Regnall standeth against that Eclesian yeare, or yeare of our Lord it ended in, and not against that it began in: so that if a question in the Computation be put in the beginning of ye regnal yeare or in this Concordancie in the ending of ye regnal yeare, the demand is easie: but if ye contrary happen, it is more hard. Therefore the matter and intent of this my worke is, when a question is pronounded by the yeare of
any King, to know in what yeare of our Lord it was: ye is, whether it were in the yeare of cur Lord. God that the regnall yeare did take beginning, or ending in. This considered, all shall be made easie by the ensuing examples.
Seeke in your Tables for Edward the 6: then in the row vnder K. Reigne, finde the 6. yeare of his reigne, which you shall sinde placed against 1552, against which in the row vnder Time expired, is 60. My leass is therefore expired in January the 8 day, 1612. Or hauing found the yeare of our Lord, count as in the first question, or substract 1552 from 1612, as before: but reckoning with the old Computation, you haue 61. yeares, which is false: but to make all plaine, worke as followeth.

Notes to bee obserued for this new kinde of of casie Computation.

YOu must first consider, that in my Kalender in the Margent vpon the left hand, the weekes be numbred from our Lady day, the which number for breuities sake, is called the Hebdomadall Number.
Next, here is an insuing Table, wherein the names of all the Kings and Queenes of England since the Conquest be writ: and to them is added a certaine number of weeks and daies, as to Henry the 7, 21 weekes, and 3 dayes, which I call Epact, which Bosco saith is Intercalare, or addere. But howsoeuer, you may admit the word without offence, since it is but for distinction or difference sake which had worke, (...) followeth.

When any question is propounded by the yeare of any King only, without mention of ye Eccles^^^ (...) yeare, you must note in what Kings reign^^ (...) what moneth, and day of the moneth it (...) date. Next, 'find the said moneth, and (...) moneth, and see what Hebdomadall (...) ^^^reth thereunto: that is, how (...) it is from the 25 of March: (...) ^^^ble finde the name of the King (...) number of weekes and da^^^ (...) pact: and against the (...) numbers, viz. (...) consider which (...)
If the E^^^^^ (...) the dem^^^ (...)
yeare, which standeth against the Ecclesian yeare periodically.
But if the Hebdomadall number be the greater, the demand was made in the beginning of the Regnall yeare, which answereth to the Ecclesian yeare, or yeare of our Lord next before. And of both these differences an example followeth.


Quest. 3 I haue an Euidence bearing date the 13 of May, in the 23 yeare of Elizabeth. I would know 1612, what yeare of our Lord it was, how long since, and how long after the Conquest it was.

ANSVVER.

To answer this question by this new Table, first seeke ye Epact of Elizabeth, which is 33 weeks and 6 daies: then the Hebdomadall number of the 13 of May, is 13 weeks: here the Epact is ye greater. Therefore, according to the first difference, ye demand is made in the ending of the regnal yeare that stands periodically against the yeare of our (...) in the Concordancy. Wherefore to resolue (...) ^^estion, find the 23 yeare of Elizabeth, a^^^ (...) ^^ich standeth 1581, in the first row: in (...) 15, and in the fourth is 31: whereby (...) Euidence was dated in the 25 Anno Domini 1581, 515 af^^^ (...) that it is 31 yeares since, (...), see the answere to (...)



Quest. 4. I haue a lease bearing date the 5 of March, in the 2 yeare of Elizabeth, and is to continue for 60 yeares: I demand what yeare of our Lord it was dated in, and consequently how many yeares bee expired this yeare 1612.

ANSVVER.

As in the last question, conferre the Epact of Elizabeth, and the Hebdomadall Number of the 5 of March together, noting which is the greater. In this question the Hebdomadall number is the greater: therefore according to the second difference, the demand was made in the beginning of the regnall yeare, which answereth to the yeare of our Lord next before.
Seeke therefore the second yeare of Elizabeth, against which in the first row is 1560: but for the causes before said, you must take the yeare next before: that is, 1559, and that yeare of our Lord was the lease dated in, the tune expired standing against the same, as 53 and so many yeares of my lease bee expired. But if you seeke how many yeares be expired in any other yeare after 1612, worke as in the first question.


Quest. 5. To finde Easter day, and the rest of the moueable feasts, because many times Deeds, etc. beare date vpon such dayes, without mention of the moneth, as also to finde the Dominicall letter.

First seeke the yeare of our Lord God, or yeare of the King, against either of which in the last row vpon the right hand, is the moneth, and day of the moneth ye Easter day fell vpon that yeare: which had, get the other moueable Feasts thus:
From Easter day count fixe Sundaies backewards, so haue you Quadragessima, or the first Sunday in Lent: then goe backe vnto the next Tuesday, so haue yee Shroue-tuesday. Againe, From Easter day forwards count fiue weekes, or 35 dayes; so haue you Rogation Sunday. The next Thursday after is Ascension day. Ten dayes after is Whitsunday. The next Sunday following is Trinitie Sunday, and foure dayes after is Corpus Christi day.
Hauing found Easter day, see what day of the Moneth it happened on, and finde that day in the Kalender: for the letter answering thereto was Dominicall letter that yeare.
As 1611 Easter day was the 24 of March, to which F answereth in the Kalender: therefore F was Sunday letter that yeare.
But when it is Leape-yeare there be two Dominicall letters, whereof that which beginneth the yeare, and serueth till Saint Mathias day, is noted by the time in the Table when Easter day happeneth, and the other seruing to the end of the yeare is the next letter in the Alphabet that goeth before: or this letter is found by Easter day, as before.



Quest 6. I haue a deed bearing date vpon Wednesday day in the Easter weeke, in the yeare of our Lord 1556. I desire this present yeare 1612. to know in what Kings yeare it was, what moneth, what day of the Moneth, and how long since it was dated.

ANSVVER.

First seeke 1556, against which vnder Easter day, standeth Aprill 5. Wherefore Easter day was the 5 of Aprill, D beeing Dominicall letter: so that Wednesday in Easter weeke was the 8 of Aprill, G standing for the same: then you may see it was in Queene Maries time: and remembring what was said before) in the third yeare of her reigne, and that it is 56 yeares since, and 490 after the Conquest.
Now if any euidence beare date vpon the Kalends, Nones, or Ides of any moneth, they bee easily found in the Kalender without further speech, because they stand against the ordinary day of the moneth.
Note by ye name of euery King deceased, you shall finde one of these words, Periodicall, which signifieth the King reigned so many yeares as be in the Concordancie, beside odde monethes, etc. or Defectiue, which signifieth hee did not reigne compleat so many yeares, but onely wrote of so many.



Quest. 7. How shall I make a Concordancie of principall times of note, that were in being long since?

ANSVVER.

In the ensuing Table is set downe how many yeares it is since at this present yeare 1612.
Since the
Creation 5582Flood. 3925Promise of Abraham. 3558Israelits departure out of Egypt 3128Entrance of Brute into England. 2719Building of ye Temple of Salomo^. 2648Building of Rome. 2363Captiuity of Babylon. 2217Death of Alexander 1936.Birth of Christ, 1612passio^ of Christ. 1579England receiued the faith. 1432Conquest of England. 546Inuenting of Printing. 152Order of Templars 494Time ye London and Paris were co^manded to be paued. 426Building of London bridge with stone. 435
But if you seeke how long it is since any of these times after 1612, seeke in your Table what number standeth against yt proposed yeare of our Lord in the row vnder Time expired, and that adde to the time of note proposed, and if the demand were made in any yeare before 1612, take ye number vnder ye title Time expired answering to the yeare of our Lord out of ye number in the former table: as 1600 I would know how long it was the^ after the Creation: therefore according to what is said, I take 12 from 5582, so haue I 5570, my demand.



Quest. 8. How shall I finde the Golden number, Circle of the Sunne, and Epact by this Concordancy?

ANSVVER.

To the time of Post Conquestum adde three, and from the Total reiect 19 so often as you may, or diuide by 19: so is ye which remaineth the Golden number, and the quotient, or number of 19 reiected, the number of Reuolutions of the said Circle since the Conquest.
Now for the Circle of the Sunne, to the time of post Conquestum, adde 11, diuiding by 28, as before by 19, so is the remainder the Circle of the Sunne.
For the Epact worke as in the 30. Chapter.

To know if figures be mistaken in the Concordancy.
Adde Anno Domini, and Time expired together, for they must make both 1612, I meane in none of the Tables after 1612.
Also, adde Time expired and post Conquestum both together: for they must make 1612.
Also take 1066 from the proposed yeare, and the remainder is post conquestum.
Lastly, take Ann. Dom. proposed fro^ the present yeare of our Lord, so haue you Time expired. Let this suffice for the briefe vse of this Concordancy.



Of the foure times of pleading, called Tearmes, and of their Returnes.

For the hearing and determining of all kinde of co^tracts, discords, and such like in yt common weale,
there be foure times in the yeare appointed, which be called Termes, because in those dayes the learned Iudges set Finis and Terminus, Contentionum, or Terminus litis, that is, an end of contention and debate betwixt party and party.
Now euery of these foure Tearmes consist of foure, fiue or eight Returnes: euery Returne of foure daies, and euery day seruing vnto a seuerall purpose.
Note therefore that euery Tearme hath but part, or all of these 6 kinde of Returnes, viz. Crastino Octabis, Quindeno, Tres Mense, and Quinque, as you may gather hereafter. Euery of which Returnes hath a Basis, or knowne day, from whence they take their denomination, and bee reckoned. The signification of which sixe kinde of Returnes is thus:
Crastino is the morrow after the Basis, or day nominated, as Crastino Trinitatis, is the morrow after Trinity Sunday, Trinity Sunday being the Basis, and the day that giues the denomination. Octabis is 8 dayes after inclusiuely. Quind. is 15 dayes after, Tres, that day three-weekes, Mense that day moneth, and Quinq. that day fiue weekes.
Now euery of these Returnes hath foure seueral, daies wherupon they consist: The first whereof hath double signification, the one is the day of Returne, and the other the day of Essoyne for the defendant in a personall action, or the Tenant in are all action, to bee essoyned. The second, is the day of Exceptions, for the Plaintiffe or Demaundant to lay an exception, if no Essoyne bee
cast, that the Defendant shall not be essoyned, or amerced. The third is, Returna Breuium, that is, the day whereon the Sheriffe must returne the writ. And the fourth is the day of appearance for Parties and Iurors in the Court of Common Pleas.
But if so any of these dayes fall vpon an Holyday, that is no Court day: as in Easter Tearme vpon Ascension day, in Trinity Terme vpon S. Iohn Baptists day, in Michaelmas Terme vpon All-Saints day, and in Hillary Terme vpon the Purification of our Lady, or vpon any Sunday, (all which bee not Court dayes,) then must the next day following serue for both. As if the Essoyne day fell vpon a Sunday, then Munday must serue for Essoyne day, and day of Exception both.
As for these dayes, they haue all most vse in the Court of Common pleas, where all sutes commence by originall etc. But for Latitats, or other processe vpon a bill certaine, it is vpon a day certaine, as Die lunae proxi, post Purifi. which must alwayes be reckoned from the essoyne day.
In the Starre-chamber, Chauncery, Court of Wards, and Court of Requests, they vse none of these Returnes, but onely the day of appearance, which is quarto die post.
Yet note well, if a Capias, Exigent, Scri-facias, or Destringas be executed after the day of Essoyne by the Sheriffe, or a Commission seate vpon out of any of the foresaid Courts, after the said Essoyne day, it is neither iustifiable, nor warrantable:
but for that these Termes may be found out easily by euery one for euer, as also for that it is most fit for all men to know, I haue deuised in performance thereof, the ensuing Table for their sakes, whose vse is thus.



To find the beginning and ending of the Tearmes by a new Table for euer in a most easie maner.

The which two numbers keepe, calling that you found in the body of the Table weekes, and that in the front of the Table, dayes: then to find how the Tearmes shall happe, enter the Table before, and in the two rowes vpon your left hand, vnder Interuallum minus, finde the numbers formerly found in the little Table, answering to which vpon your right hand, is the beginning and ending of euery Tearme, vnder their proper Titles.
Example. 1613. The Prime is 18. and the Dominicall letter C, as in the 32 Chapter: then I enter the former little Table, and finde 18 vpon the left side, and so proceeding vntill I come vnder C. I finde 7 in the body of the Table, and 2 ouer C: the which 7 and 2 I finde in the Table of Termes, in the rowes vnder inter, min. whereby proceeding rightwards, I may conclude that Easter Tearme shall begin Aprill 21, and end May 17.
Trinity Tearme begins Iune 4, and ends Iune 23, and so forth. The like for any other yeare. As for the Returnes of euery Tearme, they be these that follow.

Easter Tearme hath 5 Returnes.
Quindeno paschae, Tres paschae, Mense paschae, Quinque paschae, and Crastino Ascensionis.
Trinity Tearme hath 4 Returnes.
Crastino Trinitatis, Octabis Trinitatis, Quindeno Trinitatis, and Tres Trinitatis.

Hillary Tearme hath 4 Returnes.
Octabis Hilar. Quind. Hill. Crastino Purificationis, and Octab. Purificationis.
Michaelmas Tearme hath 8 Returnes.
Octa. Michael, Quind. Mich, Tres Mich. Mense Mich. Crastino Animarum, Crastino Martini, Octa. Marti. Quindeno Marti.

Now if you would know what day any of these Returnes happen vpon, remember what is faid before, and it is easie.

The vulgar Notes of the Tearmes.
Easter Tearme beginneth 17 daies affer Easter, and endeth 4 daies after Ascension day.
Trinity Tearme beginneth the next day after Corpus Christi day, ending the wednesday fortnight.
Michaelmas Tearme beginneth the 9. or 10 of October, ending the 28. or 29. of Nouember.

The Exchequer alwaies openeth eight dayes before any Tearme; onely excepting Trinitie Tearme, and then it openeth but 4 daies before.








A new Table for twenty yeares, shewing the beginning and ending of the foure Termes: the vse whereof is thus: Seeke the yeare of our Lord in the Colume vpon the left hand, answering to which in a right line rightwards, is the day of the moneth that enery Terme beginneth and endeth, vnder their proper titles.

The old and vulgar Rule remembred in diuers Books, whereby to know the Law-dayes, in the Court of Arches, the Audience of Canterbury, the Spirituall and Ciuill lawes throughout the yeare, which I am bold to insert, since it is proper to no particular Author.

Michaelmas Tearme.
S. Luke.
S. Simon and Iude.
S. Faith.
S. Edward.
All Saints.
S. Martine.
Edmond K.
S. Katherin.
S. Andrew.
The Conception of our Lady.

Ye must well vnderstand, that the first day ensuing each of the Feastes set downe before euery Terme, the Court of ye Arches is kept in the forenoone at Bow Church: and in the afternoone the same first day, is kept in Southwarke the Admirall Court for ciuili causes.
The second day after each of these feasts, ye Audience Court of Canterbury is held in yt Consistory in Pauls in the fore-noone: and the Prerogatine Court of Canterbury is kept in the same place in the afternoone the same day.
The third day following any of those feasts, the Bishop of Londons Court of Consistory is holden in Pauls in the fore-noone: and in the same place is the Court of the Queenes highnesse Comissioners vpon Appeales, and the court of Delegates holden in the after-noone the same third day.


Hillarie Tearme.
S. Hillary.
S. Wolstane.
Conuers. of Paul.
S. Blase.
S. Scolastice.
S. Valentine.
Ashwedensday
S. Matthias.
S. Chadde.
Perpet. and Feli
S. Gregory.
An. of our L.

Vnderstand that the foure first Feasts of this Terme be neuer cha^ged, but are certaine; the other are sometime kept, and somtime omitted, after the course of the yeare altered. And if it so chaunce, ye one of those feasts be Ashwedensday, that are after S. Blase day, so that the same Law-day after Ashwedensday cannot be kept, because the Law-day of ye other feast doth light on the same day: the second Law-day after Ashwedensday shall be kept, and the other omitted.
And if the Law-day after Ashwedensday be the next day after S. Blase, then shall all and euery of those daies bee obserued in order, as they may be held conueniently.
And note, that although Ashwedensday be the 7 in order, yet it hath no certaine place, but is changed as the feast of Easter causeth it.

Easter Tearme.
The 15. day after Easter.
Saint Alphage.
Saint Marke Euangelift.
Inuention of the Crosse.
Gordian.
Saint Dunstane,
Ascension day.

In this Terme, the first sitting is alwaies kept
the Munday being the 15 day after Easter, and so after the feasts here noted, which shall next follow by course after Easter, and ye like space being kept betweene other feasts, the rest of the law-daies are kept the third day after the Ascension, which is the last of this Terme. And if it happen that ye Ascension day do come before any of those feasts aforesaid, then they are omitted for that yeare. And likewise, if any of those dayes come before the 15 day after Easter, those dayes are also omitted.

Trinitie Tearme.
Trinitie-sunday.
Corpus Christi.
Boniface bishop
S. Barnabe.
S. Botolph.
S. Iohn.
S. Paul.
Tr. S. Tho.
S. Swithin.
S. Margaret.
S. Anne.

Remember that the Law-daies of this Terme are changed by the meanes of Pentecost; and the first sitting is holden alwayes the first day after Trinitie Sunday, and the second Law-day is holden the first day after Corpus Christi day, except it fall on some day aboue named, which chaunceth somtime, and then the fitter day is kept. And after ye second session account foure daies or there about, and then looke which is the next feast, and the first law-day after the said feast shall be the third session: the other law-daies follow in order, but so many of them are kept, as for the time of the yeare is thought meet.
Note generally that euery day is called a Law-day,
that is not Sunday or holiday, and that if the feast day being knowne of any Court day in any Terme, and the first or second day following bee Sunday, then the Court day is kept after the said holiday or feast day.
First of all, these dayes are not altered, except they light on Sunday, or some Holiday, and euery day is called a Law day, vnlesse it be Sunday or Holiday.
Note pag. 241. l. 10. Corpus day is omitted.


Wages for Boat-men, and for their Barges and Boats, confirmed by Act of Parliament, Ann. 6. H. 8. Cap. 7.
VVHereas Watermen, or Maisters of Barges and Boats, did (as they doe) continually practise to raise the wages or hire of their Boats, breaking thereby ye ancient custome and reasonable wages, and so abused the great, and exacted on the poore, whereby many assaults and frayes wore (and sometime are) committed, which hath often caused manslaughter: and also by reason of that easte and vnconscionable gaine, the seruants of many House-holders and Husbandmen neare adioyning where such Boates or Ferries were, did daily runne from their maisters and become Watermen. For the auoyding of which, and many such other inconueniences, it was ordained by the former Statute of H. 8. that these laudable customes, and ancient orders of wages for Boat-men should bee obserued and
kept, vpon pains that the offender should forfeit treble the fare: and that all Bailiffes, Constables, and other the Kings officers next adioyning vnto the Ferries, vpon complaint to them made, or to any of them by them that be grieued in that behalfe, to arrest them, and commit them to ward for their misdemeanour, and that they should make fine for the same. All which, to the end the poore and simple should not be deceiued, nor the better sort deluded: and to the end euery one might in that behalfe certainly know, what wages was due to euery Ferry, whereby both parties might know: the one when he giues, and the other when he receiueth abountifull reward. And that they should not murmure when a Gentleman giueth three pence, or foure pence for crossing the water, I haue taken paines to set downe the wages allowed to euery Ferry by the Statute, as followeth.

First, for wages for Boat-men, and for their Barges or Boates, or for a Barge from London to Grauesend, foure shillings, or else euery person and his male two pence, so it passe not foure shillings.
From London to Erith, Greenewich, Grastorrocke, or Purfleete twelue pence, or else for euery person and his fardell a peny, so it passe not 12 d. 
From London to Wolwich, thirteene pence for a Boat or Wherry, that is, the Tyde-boat, or else euery person a halfe peny.
From London to Greenewich foure pence, or else a halfe peny for euery person and his fardell.

From London-bridge, Old Swan, the Crane in the Vintry, S. Mary Queries, or Pauls Wharfe, to Westminster, or Lambeth, or from Westminster or Lambeth to any of the foresaid places 3 pence, or else euery person a halfe-peny.
From Blacke-Friers, Bride-well and the Temple to Westminster or Lambeth, two pence with their males, or a halfe-peny for euery person, so it amount not aboue two pence.
From Westminster to Lambeth, or Strand-gate, or any way crossing the water, a halfe peny.
For a boat from London to Mortlake 12 d. or else euery person 2 d. with his male. And from those places aboue named to London, for a Boat or Barge, the like summes of money.
Watermen rowing in great Barges we Lords, or other persons, to haue 6 d. the day, and find the^selues, vnlesse they row to Mortlake, etc. then to haue 8 d. a peecs by day, and find themselues.
