T. Cecill sculp. THE AVTHOR TO THE READER. H Auing seene (iudicious Reader how careful∣ly in other Kingdomes, the Monuments of the dead are preserued, and their Inscripti∣ons or Epitaphs registred in their Church-Bookes; and hauing read the Epitaphs of Italy, France, Germany, and other Nations, collected and put in print by the paines of Schraderus, Chy∣traeus, Swertius, and other forraine Writers. And also know∣ing withall how barbarously within these his Maiesties Domi∣nions, they are (to the shame of our time) broken downe, and vtterly almost all ruinated, their brasen Inscriptions erazed, torne away, and pilfered, by which inhumane, deformidable act, the honourable memory of many vertuous and noble per∣sons deceased, is extinguished, and the true vnderstanding of diuers Families in these Realmes (who haue descended of these worthy persons aforesaid) is so darkened, as the true course of their inheritance is thereby partly interrupted: grieuing at this vnsufferable iniurie offered as well to the liuing, as the dead, out of the respect I bore to venerable Antiquity, and the due re∣gard to continue the remembrance of the defunct to future po∣steritie; I determined with my selfe to collect such memorials of the deceased, as were remaining as yet vndefaced; as also to reuiue the memories of eminent worthy persons entombed or interred, either in Parish, or in Abbey Churches▪ howsoeuer some of their Sepulchres are at this day no where to be discer∣ned; neither their bones and ashie remaines in any place to bee gathered. Whereupon with painefull expences (which might haue beene well spared perhaps you will say) I trauailed ouer the most parts of all England, and some part of Scotland; I collected the Funerall Inscriptions of all the Cathedrall Chur∣ches of the one, and in some of the other, and euer by the way gathered such as I found in Parochiall Churches▪ I likewise tooke view of many ancient Monuments not inscribed, de∣manding of the Church officers, or others the inhabitants, for whom such and such Tombes or Sepulchres were made and erected, which was told me according to that truth which was deliuered vnto them by tradition: after all this scrutinie, fin∣ding so few, or none at all in many Churches (time, the ma∣lignitie of wicked people, and our English profane tenacitie, hauing quite taken them away for lucre sake) I was altoge∣ther discouraged to proceede any further in this my laborious and expencefull enterprise; vntill I came casually into the ac∣quaintance of my deare deceased friend, Augustine Vincent, Es∣quire, Windsor Herald, & keeper of the Records in the Tower, who perswaded me to goe forward as I had begun, and with∣all gaue me many Church-Collections, with diuers memorable Notes, and Copies of Records, gathered by himselfe and o∣thers; and by his meanes I had free accesse to the Heralds Of∣fice, to write out such antiquities as I could there finde for my purpose. But aboue all, I am most bound to loue the foresaid Vin∣cents memory, for that he made me knowne to that honoura∣ble Gentleman Sir Robert Cotton, Knight and Baronet; who forthwith apprehending the scope and drift of this my Argu∣ment (his generous disposition being alwaies ready to afford his best furtherance to other mens industrious labours) gaue me his able directions, and withall, lent me out of his inestima∣ble Librarie, such Bookes and Manuscripts as were most fit∣ting for my vse. But alas, this worthy repairer of eating-times ruines, this Philadelphus, in preseruing old Monuments, and ancient Re∣cords: this Magazin, this Treasurie, this Store-house of Anti∣quities, Sir Robert Cotton, is now lately deceased, whose excel∣lent good parts are well conceiued in a Funerall Elegie which hath happily come into my hands, and which I thinke fitting here to be inserted. Viro clarissimo Roberto Cottono, ab antiqua Regum prosapia oriundo, Epicedium. Qualis Homerus erat, cuius de fonte furores Sacros hauserunt veteresque nouique Poetae▪ A funerall E∣legie vpon the death of Sir Robert Cotton Knight and Baronet.

"Eclipsim patitur sapientia, Sol sepelitur, "Cui si par vnus minus esset flebile funus. He died at his house in Westminster the sixt of May, about ten of the clocke in the forenoone, Anno 1631. being aged, threescore yeares, three moneths, and some few odde dayes: He tooke to wife Elizabeth, one of the daughters and heires of William Brocas Esquire, by whom hee had issue, onely one Sonne, Sir Thomas Cotton Baronet, now liuing; who married Margaret, Daughter of the Lord William Howard, grandchild to Thomas Duke of Norfolke, by whom hee hath issue, one Sonne, named Iohn, and two Daughters, Lucie and Francis. But to returne: I haue had many helpes, I confesse, from Sir Henry Spelman, Knight, and Iohn Selden Esquire, the most lear∣ned Antiquaries now liuing of our times: nor haue the helpes beene few which I haue long receiued from the well furnisht, and daily increasing Librarie of Sir Simonds D'Ewes Knight, whose iudicious directions, and ready assistance, were as of∣ten vouchsafed vnto mee, as I had occasion to request, and whose long studied, and still intended labours for the publique good, though in another kinde, may in due time make his me∣mory and themselues deare vnto posteritie: Diuers of the He∣ralds haue much furthered these my intended designes; namely, Sir Richard, and Sir Henry Saint George, Knights▪ Iohn Philipot, and William Le Neue, Esquires, which I shall euer ac∣knowledge, as occasion presents it selfe. Venerable Bede, when hee compiled the Chronicles of the English Saxons, had all the helpe that might be of the Bishops and learned men of this Land. Cymbertus wrote vnto him all that was done in Lincolnshire: Nothelmus also sent vnto him all that he had gathered together in Sussex, Surrey, and Kent. Alcuinus gaue him his labours and collections for the Prouince of Yorke. Daniel of Winchester made him priuie of all that was done amongst the west Saxons: And from all other quar∣ters of the Land, were Letters, Scrowles, and writings, dire∣cted vnto him by messengers, to aide and assist him in his en∣terprise, as he doth himselfe acknowledge in his Epistle Dedi∣catory to Ceolnulph, King of the Northumbers. Now generous Reader, as hee had these helpes for the per∣fecting of his Ecclesiasticall Historie, and as I haue had the ac∣ceptable assistance of many of my good friends, studious in this kinde, for the finishing of this first part, and the rest of the worke now in hand, which is already in a good forwardnesse, let me intreate thy furtherance in the same thus farre, that, in thy neighbouring Churches, if thou shalt finde any ancient funerall Inscriptions, or antique obliterated Monuments, thou wouldst be pleased to copie out the one, and take so much rela∣tion of the other as tradition can deliuer; as also to take the In∣scriptions and Epitaphs vpon Tombes and Grauestones which are of these times; and withall to take order that such thy collections, notes, and obseruations may come safely to my hands; and I shall rest euer obliged to acknowledge thy paines and curtesie. And I would earnestly desire the Tombe-makers of this Citie of London, and elsewhere, that they would be so care∣full of posteritie, as to preserue in writing the Inscriptions or Epitaphs which they daily engraue vpon Funerall Monu∣ments, from whom I shall expect the like kindnesse, and to whom I will euer remaine alike thankfull. For, I intend, God willing, hereafter to publish to the view of the world, as well the moderne, as the ancient memorialls of the dead through∣out all his Maiesties foresaid Dominions, if God spare me life; if not, it is enough for me to haue begun, as Camden saith in his Epistle to the Reader of his booke Britannia, and I haue gained as much as I looke for, if I shall draw others, when I am dead, into this argument; whose inquisitiue diligence and learning, may finde out more, and amend mine. It may seeme, peraduenture, vnpleasing to some, for that I do speake so much of, and extoll the ardent pietie of our fore∣fathers in the erecting of Abbeyes, Priories, and such like sa∣cred Foundations. To the which I answer with Camden, that I hold it not fit for vs to forget, that our Ancestours were, and we are of the Christian profession, and that there are not extant any other more conspicuous and certaine Monuments of their zealous deuotion towards God, then these Monasteries with their en∣dowments, for the maintenance of religious persons, neither any other seed-plots besides these, from whence Christian Re∣ligion and good literature were propagated ouer this our Island. Neither is there any other act of pietie more acceptable in the sight of Almighty God, then that of building Churches, Oratories, and such like sacred edifices, for the true seruice of his heauenly Maiestie. Ethelbert the first Christian King of Kent, hauing built S. Pauls Church London, and diuers other Churches and religi∣ous structures, as I shew hereafter, is thus commended to po∣steritie by this Epitaph following, which passed with applause no question in those dayes. Rex Ethelbertus hic clauditur in Polyandro, Fana pians certus Christo meat absque Meandro. King Ethelbert lyeth here closed in this Polyander, For building Churches sure he goes To Christ without Maeander. The pious care likewise and gracious intention of our late Lord and Soueraigne King Iames of famous memory, had, for the repairing of the foresaid Church of Saint Paul, and the earnest desire and purpose, which our dread Lord and Soue∣raigne now hath (proceeding out of his zeale to Gods glory and his diuine worship) for the repairing and vpholding, as his Father intended, of that venerable large Fabricke and goodly Pyle of building, will be had in remembrance to all ge∣nerations, and their names will be registred in the booke of the liuing. And the munificent allowance towards the said worke from William Laud, now Lord Bishop of London, of one hun∣dred pounds by the yeare, while he doth contiune there Bishop, shall be commended, and had in remembrance of all his Suc∣cessours for euer. It may, perhaps, bee distastfull to some for that I write so fully of the fall and backsliding of Religious Persons from their primitiue zealous ardour of piety, making that the maine cause of the dissolution of Abbeyes: which I doe, for that some are of opinion, that because many of these Monasteries were built vpon the occasion of rapine and bloud, the Foun∣ders thereby thinking to expiate their guilt, and make satisfa∣ction for their sinnes (an errour in point of Diuinitie) these sacred structures howsoeuer consecrated to the seruice of Al∣mighty God, could not stand fast, nor continue in one and the same state for many ages; therefore I thinke it meete and expe∣dient to discouer and lay open to the world, the manifold enor∣mities of the professed votaries residing in such religious foun∣dations; that it may euidently appeare that it was not the sinnes of the Founders (of whose pious intentions we ought to haue a more reuerend opinion) that their donations were of no longer continuance but that the delinquencies of the reli∣gious Orders themselues, were the sole cause of their owne vt∣ter subuersion. I may, perhaps, be sound fault withall, because I doe not chorographically and according as Churches stand, neare or further remote in one and the same Lath hundred or wapen∣tack, emprint and place the Funerall Monuments in this my booke; but slip sometimes from one side of a County to ano∣ther before I emprint and Epitaph. To which giue me leaue to make this answer, that hauing found one or two ancient Fu∣nerall inscriptions, or obliterated Sepulchers, in this or that Parish Church, I haue ridden to ten Parish Churches distant from that, and not found one. Besides I haue beene taken vp in diuers Churches by the Churchwardens of the Parish, and not suffered to write the Epitaphs, or to take view of the Mo∣numents as I much desired, for that I wanted a Commission; which would greatly haue encouraged me (and still it would) as that of Henry the eight did Iohn Leyland, in the prosequution of this businesse. I conclude the Epitaphs and Funerall inscriptions in this booke as I finde them engrauen, with a cuius anime propitietur Deus : or with God pardon his soule; which some may say might haue beene as well left out of my booke, as they are in many places scraped out of the brasse: And I write the Latine in the same manner as I finde it either written or imprinted, as capud for caput, nichil for nihil, and the like; as also E vocall, for E dipthong, dipthongs being but lately come into vse. And now I hope that neither the conclusion of the one, nor ter∣mination of the other will seeme any way offensiue to my in∣telligent Reader. I likewise write the Orthographie of the old English as it comes to my hands; and if by the copying out of the same it be any manner of wayes mollified, it is much against my will, for I hold originalls the best; whereby some may obiect the sim∣plicitie of my vnlaboured stile, and the rough hewen forme of my writing. To which I reply, that this my kinde of Argu∣ment is incapable of all eloquent speech. When I cite Ouid or Lucan, I vse those exquisite translations of George Sa dys, and Thomas May Esquires. Some will say, that the Epitaphs of London are already prin∣ted, and true it is that some are, especially such as are of later times, with which I do not meddle at all, onely I set downe those of more antiquitie, which haue either beene omitted in the collection, or for which I haue some historicall elucidati∣ons, for the better vnderstanding of the qualities of the parties defunct and interred. Hauing had the helps and collections of many, my Reader may finde errours in some, which hereafter I shall studie to amend; intreating in the meane time a fauorable construction. Many are the errataes, I am afraid, which will be found in the printing, the greatest I haue met withall I haue amended, not doubting but some also of consequence haue escaped mee; and for those of lesser note, I haue passed them ouer, desiring my Reader to correct and pardon. Thus, curteous Reader, submitting my selfe, and this worke, to thy learned and friendly censure, I take my leaue. From my House in Clerkenwell Close, this 28. of May 1631. Chytraeus.

A DISCOVRSE OF Funerall Monuments, &c. CHAP. I. Of Monuments in generall. A Monument is a thing erected, made, or written, for a memoriall of some remarkable action, fit to bee trans∣ferred to future posterities And thus generally taken, all religious Foundations, all sumptuous and magnifi∣cent Structures, Cities, Townes, Towers, Castles, Pil∣lars, Pyramides, Crosses, Obeliskes, Amphitheaters, Statues, and the like, as well as Tombes and Sepul∣chres, are called Monuments. Now aboue all remembrances (by which men haue endeuoured, euen in despight of death to giue vnto their Fames eternitie) for worthinesse and continuance, bookes, or writings, haue euer had the preheminence. Marmora Maeonij vincunt monimenta libelli; Viuitur ingenio, caetera mortis erunt. The Muses workes stone-monuments out last; 'Tis wit keepes life, all else death will downe cast. Horace thus concludes the third booke of his lyrick poesie. Exegi monimentum are perennius, Regalique situ, &c. A monument then brasse more lasting, I, Then Princely Pyramids in site more high Haue finished, which neither fretting showers, Nor blustering windes, nor flight of yeares, and houres, Though numberlesse, can raze. I shall not die Wholly; nor shall my best part buried lie Within my Graue. And Martial lib. 10. Ep. 2. thus speakes of bookes and writings. Reader my wealth, whom when to me Rome gaue; Nought greater to bestow (quoth she) I haue. By him ingratefull Lethe thou shalt flie, And in thy better part shalt neuer die. Wilde fig-trees rend Messalla's marbles off; Chrispus halfe horses the bold Carters scoffe; Writings, no age can wrong, nor theeuing hand, Deathlesse alone those monuments will stand. —My books are read in euery place. Lib. 8. ep. 3. And when Licinius, and Messalla's high Rich marble Towers in ruin'd dust shall lie, I shall be read, and strangers, euerie where, Shall to their farthest homes my verses beare. Lib. 10. Epig. 11. And in another Ep. thus much of his bookes. 'Tis not the Citie onely doth approue My muse, or idle eares my verses loue; The rough Centurion, where cold frosts orespread The Scythian fields, in warre my books are read. My lines are sung in Britaine farre remote; And yet my emptie purse perceiues it not. What deathlesse numbers from my penne would flow? What warres would my Pierian Trumpet blow? If, as Augustus now againe doth liue, So Rome to me would a Mecaenas giue. In like manner Ouid giues an endlesse date to himselfe, and to his Meta∣morphosis in these words. In conclu. li. vlt. Iamque opus exegi, &c. And now the worke is ended, which, Ioues rage, Nor Fire, nor Sword, shall raze, nor eating Age; Come, when it will, my Deaths vncertaine houre, Which onely of my bodie hath a power: Yet shall my better part transcend the skie; And my immortall name shall neuer die: For where-soere the Romane Eagles spread Their conquering wings, I shall of all be read. And if wee Prophets truly can diuine, I in my liuing Fame shall euer shine. S. Ierom in like manner, in one of his Epistles, writeth of the perpetuity of a funerall Elegie, which he made himselfe to the deare memorie of his be∣loued Fabiola, who was buried in the citie of Bethlem; not because the said Elegie was cut or engrauen upon her Sepulchre, but for that he had written it down in one of his volumes, according to these his own words following. Exegi monimentum tuum aere perennius, quod nulla destruere possit vetu∣stas; incîdi Eulogium Sepulchro tuo, quod huic volumini subdidi, vt quocun{que} noster Sermo peruenerit, te laudatam; te in Bethlem conditā Lector agnoscat. Varus Tribune of Rome, hath beene and will be longer remembred by Martials Epigram, lib. 10. ep. 26. then euer hee could haue beene by any funerall monument, which is lately made thus to speake English. Varus, which as Romes Tribune didst command An hundred men, renown'd in Aegypt land: Now as a stranger Ghost thou dost remaine On Nilus shore, promisd to Rome in vaine. We could not dew with teares thy dying face, Nor thy said funerall flames with odours grace; Yet in my verse eterniz'd shalt thou bee, Of that false Egypt cannot cousen thee. Thus Lucan lib. 9. of his owne verse and Caesars victorie at Pharsalia. O great and sacred worke of poesy, Thou freest from fate, and giu'st eternity To mortall wights; but, Caesar enuy not Their liuing names; if Romane Muses ought, May promise thee, whilest Homer's honoured, By future times shalt thou, and I, bee read; No age shall vs with darke oblivion staine, But our Pharsalia euer shall remaine. Bookes then and the Muses workes are of all monuments the most perma∣nent; for of all things else there is a vicissitude, a change both of cities and nations: as we may thus reade in Ouids Metamorphosis, lib. 15. For this wee see in all is generall, Some nations gather strength, and others fall. Troy rich and powerfull, which so proudly stood, That could for ten yeares spend such streames of bloud; For buildings onely her old ruines showes, For riches, Tombes, which slaughtered fires inclose, Sparta, Mycenae, were of Greece the flowers; So Cecrops citie, and Amphions Towres: Now glorious Sparta lies vpon the ground; Lofty Mycenae hardly to be found. Of Oedipus his Thebes what now remaines; Or of Pandions Athens, but their names? Thebes, 1. Siluester, Transl. Babell, Rome, these proud heauen daring wonders, Loe vnder ground in dust and ashes lie, For earthly kingdomes, euen as men doe die. Bellay in his ruines of Rome, translated by Spenser, makes this demon∣stration or shew of that citie, to the strange countrey man or traueller: Thou stranger, which for Rome in Rome here seekest; And nought of Rome in Rome perceiu'st at all, These same old walls, old arches, which thou seest, Old palaces, is that which Rome men call. Behold what wreake, what ruine, and what wast, And how that she, which with her mighty power Tam'd all the world, hath tam'd her selfe at last: The prey of Time, which all things doth deuoure. Rome now of Rome, is the onely funerall, And onely Rome, of Rome hath victorie. Ne ought saue Tyber hastning to his fall Remaines of all: O worlds inconstancie. That which is firme, doth flit and fall away, And that is flitting, doth abide and stay. It is a vanitie for a man to thinke to perpetuate his name and memory by strange and costly great Edifices, for Not sumptuous Pyramids to skies vpreard; Nor Elean Ioues proud Fane, Proper lib. 3. El. 2. which heauen compeerd, Nor the rich fortune of Mausoleus Tombe, Are priuiledg'd from deaths extreamest doome: Or fire, or stormes, their glories do abate, Or by age shaken, fall with their owne waight. We haue many examples here in England of the small continuance (as I may so call it) of magnificent strong buildings, by the sudden fall of our re∣ligious houses, of which a late namelesse versifier hath thus written: What sacred structures did our Elders build, Wherein Religion gorgeously sat deckt? Now all throwne downe, Religion exild, Made Brothell-houses, had in base respect, Or ruind so that to the viewers eye, In their owne ruines they intombed lie: The marble vrnes of their so zealous Founders Are digged up, and turn'd to sordid vses; Their bodies are quite cast out of their bounders Lie vn interr'd. O greater what abuse is? Yet in this later age we now liue in, This barbarous act is neither shame nor sinne. Of walls, towres, castles, crosses, forts, rampiers, townes, cities, and such like monuments, here in great Britaine, which by age, warres, or the malig∣nitie of the times, are defaced, ruined, or utterly subuerted, you may reade in learned Camden : onely thus much out of famous Spenser, personating the Genius of Verlame, or Verulam, sometimes a citie neare to S. Albons. Ruines of Time. I was that Citie which the garland wore Of Britaines pride, deliuered vnto me, By Romane victors, which it wonne of yore; Though nought at all but ruines now I bee. And lie in mine owne ashes as ye see. Verlame I was, what bootes it that I was, Sith now I am but weeds and wastfull grasse? Another English muse (now liuing) vnder the name of Watling, M. rayton, P l. Song. xvi. one of the foure imperiall high wayes sings thus of the ruines of this citie. Thou saw'st when Verlam once her head aloft did reare, Which in her cinders now lies sadly buried here: With Alabaster, Tuch, and Porphery adornd, When (welneare) in her pride great Troinouant she scornd. Likewise vpon this forgotten Citie a namelesse late writer hath made this Epitaph. Stay thy foot that passest by, Here is wonder to descry, Churches that interr'd the dead, Here themselues are sepulchred; Houses, where men slept and wak't, Here in ashes vnder-rak't. In a word to allude; Here is corne where once Troy stood; Or more fully home to haue, Here's a Citie in a graue. Reader wonder thinke it then, Cities thus would die like men: And yet wonder thinke it none, Many Cities thus are gone. But I will conclude this Chapter with these two stanzaes following, ta∣ken out of Spensers poeme aforesaid, speaking of the vanity of such Prin∣ces who ( Absolon like) thinke to gaine a perpetuitie after death, by erecting of pillars, and such like monuments, to keepe their names in remembrance▪ when as it is onely the Muses works which giue unto man immortality. In vaine do earthly Princes then, in vaine, Seeke with Pyramides, to heauen aspired; Or huge Colosses, built with costly paine; Or brasen pillars, neuer to bee fired; Or Shrines, made of the metall most desired, To make their memories for euer liue: For how can mortall immortalitie giue. For deeds doe die, how euer nobly done, And thoughts of men doe in themselues decay, But wise words taught in numbers for to runne, Recorded by the Muses, liue for aye; Ne may with storming showres be washt away, Ne bitter breathing windes with harmfull blast, Nor age, nor enuie, shall them euer wast. CHAP. II. Of Funerall Monuments, Graues, Tombes, or Sepulchres. Of the ancient custome of burialls. Of Epitaphs, and other funerall honours. NOw to speake properly of a Monument, as it is here in this my en∣suing Treatise vnderstood, it is a receptacle or sepulchre, purposely made, erected, or built, to receiue a dead corps, and to preserue the same from violation. Scipio Gentilis lib. Orig. sing. Nam monumentum Sepulchri, est, quod causa muniendi eius loci factum sit, in quo corpus impositum sit, vnde Monumentum quasi muni∣mentum dicitur. And indeed these Funerall Monuments, in foregoing ages, were very fittingly called muniments, in that they did defend and fence the corps of the defunct, which otherwise might haue beene pulled out of their graues by the sauage brutishnesse of wilde beasts: for as then none were buried in Townes or Cities, but either in the fields, along the high way side (to put passengers in minde, that they were like those so interred, mortall) vpon the top, or at the feet of mountaines. Apud maiores (saith Seruiu lib. xi. Aeneid. ) aut sub montibus, aut in ipsis montibus sepeliebantur, vnde natum est, vt super cadauera aut pyramides fierent, aut ingentes collocarentur co∣lumnae. The Romanes were forbidden by this the second Law of their twelue Tables. Hominem mortuum in vrbe ne sepelito neve vrito : to bury or burne any within any Towne or Citie. For the ancient custome of buriall amongst the Iewes, wee reade, that Abraham was buried with Sara his wife, in the caue of Machpelah in the field of Ephron, Gen. cap. 25. And Vzziah king of Iuda, slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers, in the field of the buriall which pertained to the kings. 2. Chron. cap. 26. The sepulchre of Lazarus was without the citie of Bethania: and so was that of Ioseph without Ierusalem. Sandys in the relation of his long iourney, tells us, that hee was shewed the Tombe of the Prophet Samuel, as also the Sepulchre of the seuen bre∣thren (who were tortured to death by Antiochus ) fenced about with a pile of stones, square, flat, and solid, both of them being on the top of two mountaines, neare vnto the citie of Emmaus; and in the vineyards on the North-west side of the said citie, sundry places of buriall, hewne out of the maine rocke, amongst the rest, one called the Sepulchre of the Prophets. And those Egyptian lofty proud Pyramids (the barbarous wonders of vaine cost) so vniuersally celebrated, being the Regall sepulchres of the Ptolomees, were erected farre out of all cities, as the said Traueller tells vs, who did see so much of the ruines thereof, as time hath not deuoured. The Athenians buried such as were slaine in battell, and other honoura∣ble personages, in a place without the Citie called Ceramnicus. So here in England, the interments of the dead were anciently farre out of all Townes and Cities, either on the ridges of hills, or vpon spatious plaines, fortified or fenced about, with obelisks, pointed stones, Pyramids, pillars, or such like monuments; for example, Englands wonder vpon Salisbury-plaine, called Stonehenge, the sepulchre of so many Britaines, who by the treachery of the Saxons, were slaine there at a parley. That of Wada the Saxon Duke neare to Whitby in Yorkshire, and those of Carti∣gerne the Britaine, and Horsa the Saxon, neare to Ailesford in Kent. It was a thing vsuall among our old Saxon ancestours (saith Verstegan ) as by Tacitus it also seemeth to haue beene among the other Germans, that the dead bodies of such as were slaine in the field, and buried in the fields, were not layed in graues, but lying upon the ground, were couered ouer with turnes, clods, or sods of earth; And the more in reputation the per∣sons had beene, the greater and higher were the turnes raised ouer their bo∣dies: and this some vsed to call Byriging, some Beorging, and some Buri∣ging of the dead, which wee now call berying, or burying of the dead, which properly is a shrowding or an hiding of the dead bodie in the earth. Of these kinde of funerall monuments you haue many vpon Salisbury-plaine, out of which the bones of bodies thus inhum'd are of∣tentimes digged vp; which the Inhabitants thereabout call Beries, Baroes, and some Burrowes, which accordeth with the same fence of Byrighs, Beorghs, or Burghs. From whence the names of diuerse Townes and Ci∣ties are originally deriued; Places first so called, hauing beene with walls of turfe or clods of earth, fenced about for men to bee shrowded in, as in forts or Castles. Reutha, King of that neuer-conquered terrible, fierce Nation of the Scots (who flourished about they eare of the world 3784. and before the birth of our blessed Sauiour, one hundred eightie and seven yeares) ordained, That such Noblemen which had atchieued any notable exploit in defence of their countrey, should bee had in perpetuall memorie, and buried, in so∣lemne wise, in sepulchres aloft vpon hills, or mountaines, vpon which were set so many Obelisks, pillars, or long-pointed stones, as they had slaine enemies in the warres. Whereof some remaine (saith Hector Boethius in the life of the said King) there to be seene euen to this day. Sepulchres of this stately kinde of structure for persons of eminent ranke and qualitie, were sometimes (howsoeuer) erected within the cities: for wee reade in the first booke of the Maccabees, Chap. 13. that Ionathan the valiant (brother to Iudas the worthie) being slaine in battell neare to Bas∣chama, and there buried, Simon sent to take the bones of his brother Iona∣than (I will vse the words of the Text) And they buried him in Modin his fathers city. And all Israel bewailed him with great lamentation, and mourned for him verie long. And Simon made vpon the Sepulcher of his father, and his brethren, a building high to looke vnto, of hewne stone be∣hinde and before. And set vp seuen pillars vpon it, one against another, for his father, his mother, and foure brethren: And set great pillars round about them, and set armes upon the pillars for a perpetuall memorie, and carued ships beside the armes, that they might be seene of men sailing in the sea. In like manner the Romanes (notwithstanding their second law of the twelue Tables) did sometime entombe their dead within the Citie (but that was but seldome;) for the bones and ashes of Trajan the Emperour, were put into a golden vrne, and set in the Market-place, vpon the top of a pillar, of one whole peece, being one hundred and fourty foot high. And Galbaes bodie long neglected (saith Tacitus ) and in the darke de∣spightfully intreated; Argius his Steward, one of his principall bondmen, buried with small ceremonie in his priuate garden. But this was not vsuall amongst them. Hospinian lib. 3. cap. 1. out of Durandus, Vlpian, and other Authours, giues this reason: wherefore both the Iewes and Gentiles vsed to burie their dead, without the gates of Townes and Cities. It was a custome in times of old (saith he) that men and women were buried in their owne pri∣uate houses, or within their owne priuate gardens; but afterwards for the noysome savour, and contagious stinke of the dead carkases so interred, it was enacted, That all burials should bee without Townes and Cities, in some conuenient place appointed for that purpose. And howsoeuer that this order was obserued by the Gentiles upon this reason onely, Scilicet vt in vrbibus mundicies seruaretur, & aer minus inficeretur, ex cadauerum pu∣trescentium faetore ; Yet the true Christians, and such as by their liuely faith were adopted the children of God, had a further mysterie in this their man∣ner of interments; for by the carriage and buriall of their dead corps with∣out their citie walls, they did publikely confirme, and witnesse, that the parties deceased were gone out of this world, to bee made free denizons of another citie, namely, Heauen, there to remaine with the blessed Saints in eternall happinesse. This order or custome of buriall without cities, continued amongst the Christians, vntill the time of Gregory the great, for as then the Monkes, Friers, and Priests (saith my foresaid Authour) began to offer sacrifice for the soules departed; so that, for their more easie and greater profit, they procured first, that the places of sepulture should bee adioyning vnto their Churches, and afterwards they got licence to burie within Churches. Vpon this reason out of the said Gregory 13. q. cap. 2. Cum grauia peccata non deprimunt (saith hee) tunc prodest mortuis si in Ecclesijs sepeliantur; quia eorum proximi, quoties ad eadem sacra loca veniunt, suorumque sepul∣turam aspiciunt, recordantur & pro eis Domino preces fundunt. Panuinius in li∣deritu sepeli∣end. mortuos. Antiquitus tantum extra vrbem in coemiterijs hominū corpora sepelieban∣tur, pace Ecclesiae data intra vrbes, ad Templorum limina, postea etiam in ipsis templis sepeliri mos inualuit. Constantinus in porticu Templi Aposto∣lorum, Constantinopoli: Honorius in porticu Templi S. Petri Romae, eius vxor intra idem Templum sepulti sunt. Anciently the bodies of the dead were buried onely without cities in Coemiteries or sleeping places, vntill the resurrection (as the word signifies) but persecution being ended, and peace giuen to the Christian Church, the manner grew in vse to burie within Cities, at the entrance into their sacred temples, yea and afterwards in the verie Churches themselues. Constantine was buried in the porch of the Apostles in Constantinople. Honorius in the porch of S. Peter in Rome; and his wife (the Empresse) within the said Church. But to come nearer home, Austine the first Archbishop of Can∣terbury, sent hither by the foresaid Gregory, was interred in the porch of Saint Peter and Paul, commonly called Saint Austins neare vnto Canter∣bury, a religious house of his owne foundation, and together with him sixe other Archbishops who next succeeded him: whose reliques afterwards were remoued into the Abbey Church, of which I shall speake hereafter. Cuthbert or Cudbright th'eleuenth, Archbishop of that Province, ob∣tained from the Pope a dispensation, for the making of Coemiteries or Churchyards within Townes, and Cities, whereas, here in England, vntill his time, within the walls thereof none were buried. These following are the words in the Appendix to the booke of Rochester a Mss. in Sir Robert Cottons Librarie. Cutbertus Archiepiscopus Cant. xi. ab Augustino cum Romae videret plures intra Ciuitates sepeliri, rogauit Papam ut sibi liceret Coemiteria facere, quod Papa annuit, reuersus itaque coemiteria vbique in Anglia fieri constituit. This order of buriall being thus begun here in England, it likewise fol∣lowed, that Graue-stones were made, and Tombes erected with inscripti∣ons engrauen upon them, to continue the remembrance of the parties de∣ceased, to succeeding ages; and these were called Epitaphs: now, an Epitaph is a superscription (either in verse or prose) or an astrict pithie Diagram, writ, carued, or engrauen, vpon the tombe, graue, or sepulchre of the defunct, briefly declaring (and that sometimes with a kinde of commiseration) the name, the age, the deserts, the dignities, the state, the praises both of body and minde, the good or bad fortunes in the life, and the manner and time of the death of the person therein interred. Of all funerall honours (saith Camden ) Epitaphs haue alwayes beene most respectiue; for in them loue was shewed to the deceased, memorie was continued to posteritie, friends were comforted, and the Reader pu in minde of humane frailtie: and indeed the frequent visiting, and aduised reuiewing of the Tombes and monuments of the dead (but without all touch of superstition) with the often reading, serious perusall, and diligent meditation of wise and religious Epitaphs or inscriptions, found vpon the tombes or monuments, of persons of approued vertue, merit, and honour, is a great motiue to bring us to repentance. The invention of Epitaphs pro∣ceeded from the presage or forefeeling of immortalitie, implanted in all men naturally, and is referred to the Schollers of Linus the Theban Poet, who flourished about the yeare of the world 2700) who first bewailed this Li∣nus their master, when he was slaine, in dolefull verses, then called of him Aelina, afterward Epitaphia, for that they were first song at burialls, after engraued vpon the sepulchres. Funerall monuments then of costly work∣manship, with curious engrauen Epitaphs, were called Sepulchra, id est, se∣mipulchra, halfe faire and beautifull; the externall part or superficies there∣of being gloriously beautified and adorned; and hauing nothing within, but dreadfull darknesse, loathsome stinke, and rottennesse of bones, as it is in the Gospell, Mat. 23. And they are sometimes called memories, à me∣moria vel à monendo, in that by them we are put in minde, and warned to consider our fragile condition; for they are externall helpes to excite, and stirre vp our inward thoughts, habere memoriam mortis semper prae oculis: to haue the remembrance of death euer before our eyes, and that our bre∣thren defunct, may not be out of minde as out of sight. Non ob aliud, saith S. Austin in his booke De cura pro mortuis, vel me∣moriae vel monumenta dicuntur, ea quae insignita siunt Sepulchra mortuo∣rum, nisi quia eos, qui viuentium oculis morte subtracti sunt, ne obliuione etiam cordibus subtrahantur, in memoriam reuocant, & admonendo faciunt cogitari: Nam & memoriae nomen id apertissime ostendit, & monumentum eo quod moneat mentem, id est admoneat nuncupatur. In the Register of the Gray Friers London, I finde this definition of a funerall monument much what to the same effect. Monimentum est quasi monens mentem, & sic solet à doctoribus etymo¦logiari: monet namque bifarie humanam mentem, cum aut mortis memo∣riam incutit visis precedentium sepulchris; aut eisdem conspectis, mentes mo∣neantur siue moueantur carorum, ad reddend. suffragia pro ipsis. These tombes or sepulchres were also named, Requtatoria, Ossuaria, Ci¦neraria, domus aeternae, &c. as you haue them with their seuerall significati∣ons in Kirkman, De Funeribus Romanorum. Tertullian (in his booke De Resurrectione carnis, cap. 37.) calls these monuments of the dead, Cadauerum stabula, stables or stalls of carcases. Nemo iam poterit aliud mortuos interpretari, qui sunt in monimentis, nisi corpora & carnem, quia nec ipsa monimenta aliud, quam cadave∣rum stabula: which Lucian scoffingly termed campes and cottages of car∣cases. But to conclude this Chapter; R maines. the place of buriall was called by S. Paul, Seminatio, in the respect of the assured hope of resurrection: of the Greeke Coemiterion, as a sleeping place vntill the resurrection: and of the Hebrews▪ The house of the liuing, in the same respect, as the Germanes call Church∣yards vntill this day, Gods aker, or Gods field. CHAP. III. Of Sepulchres answerable to the degree of the person deceased. The diuers manner of bearing man and woman to the Graue. When both Sexes began to be borne alike. SEpulchres should bee made according to the qualitie and degree of the person deceased, that by the Tombe euery one might bee discerned of what ranke hee was liuing: for monuments answerable to mens worth, states and places, Camd. Re∣maines. haue alwayes beene allowed, and stately sepulchres for base fellowes haue alwayes lien open to bitter iests; therefore it was the vse and custome of reuerend antiquitie, to interre persons of the rusticke or ple∣beian sort, in Christian buriall, without any further remembrance of them, either by tombe, grauestone, or epitaph. Persons of the meaner sort of Gentrie, were interred with a flat grauestone, comprehending the name of the defunct, the yeare and day of his decease, with other particulars, which was engrauen on the said stone, or vpon some plate. And Gentlemen, which were of more eminencie, had their effigies or representation, cut or carued vpon a Terme or Pedestall, as it were of a pillar, raised somewhat aboue the ground, vmbelico tenus : and this image had no armes, but was formed from the waste vpwards vpon a Terme, which did beare a true resemblance of the fauour of the partie defunct Vpon the said terme (commonly) were inserted, the name, progeny, match, issue, vocation, and imployment of the defunct, with the day, yeare, and place of his death. Noble men, Princes, and Kings had (as it befitteth them, and as some of them haue at this day) their Tombes or Sepulchres raised aloft aboue ground, to note the excellencie of their state and dignitie; and withall, their personages delineated, carued, and embost, at the full length and big∣nesse, truly proportioned throughout, as neare to the life, and with as much state and magnificence, as the skill of the Artificer could possibly carue and forme the same: the materials of which were alabaster, rich marble, touch, rauce, porpherey, polisht brasse or copper, like vnto that made to the me∣morie of King Henry the seuenth in Westminster, who dwelleth more richly dead (saith Viscount Saint Alban in his history of that kings raigne) in the monument of his Tombe, then hee did aliue in Richmond or any of his palaces, it being the stateliest, and most curious daintie monument of Europe, both for the Chappell, and for the Sepu chre. And as stately monuments were not due, nor allowed▪ to euery man that was of ability to erect the same; so swelling titles, lofty inscriptions or epi∣taphs, were prohibited to bee inscrib'd, insculpt, or engrauen vpon the se∣pulchres of men of meane desert: but onely vpon the monuments of such as were of vertue, wisedome, and valour▪ as martiall men, or persons of eminent place of gouernment in the weale publike. Which is not obserued altogether in these times: for by some of our epitaphs more honour is at∣tributed to a rich quondam Tradesman, or griping vsurer, then is giuen to the greatest Potentate entombed in Westminster: and their tombes are made so huge great, that they take vp the Church, and hinder the people from diuine Seruice. Besides if one shall seriously suruay the Tombes erect∣ed in these our dayes, and examine the particulars of the personages wrought vpon their Tombes, hee may easily discerne the vanity of our mindes, vailed vnder our fantasticke habits and attires, which in time to come will be rather prouocations to vice, then incitations to vertue; and so the Temple of God shall become a Schoolehouse of the monstrous habits and attires of our present age, wherein Taylors may finde out new fashions. And which is worse, they garnish their Tombes, now adayes, with the pi∣ctures of naked men and women; raising out of the dust, and bringing into the Church, the memories of the heathen gods and goddesses, with all their whirligiggs: and this (as I take it) is more the fault of the Tombe-makers, then theirs who set them a worke. There was likewise made a difference of personages in the carriage of their dead bodies to the place of sepulture, according to their state and dignitie. Great men of birth or qualitie were carrried in chariots drawne with horses, trumpets and seuerall sorts of musicall instruments sounding before the corps; mourners, and likewise many who sung mournfull dit∣ties in praise of the defunct: to whose further honour they did also set vp in their Temples, and other publike places, certaine ornaments, as scutcheo s, crownes, and such like: of which pompous progression more in the next Chapter. Now such as could not be interred with all this maiesticke solem∣nitie, although they were of high parentage, for that the charge was very great, were buried in the euening by certaine men who had that charge, who were called Vespillons. Men of meaner ranke, howsoeuer neuer so rich, were not allowed this princely kinde of production to their graues; for their corps were borne vpon their seruants shoulders, whom they had manumitted a little before their deaths, with a Trumpet onely sounding before them, and some lights, according to this of Persius, Satyre 3. Then were prepared for his Funerall The Trumpet, and the Lights: And last of all This seeming happie man, that would not doubt His health, being composedly laid out On his high bed, his biere; and now daub'd o're, And eu'n bedurted with th'abundant store Of ointments; stretcheth tow'rd the citie gate His cold dead heeles; and those whose best estate But yesterday, was but to be his slaue, Now weare their caps, and beare him to his graue. Man and woman, though of equall degree and qualitie, were borne in a different manner to their graues. Man was borne vpon mens shoulders to signifie his dignitie and superioritie ouer his wife; and woman at the armes end, to signifie, that being inferiour to man, in her life time, she should not be equalled with him at her death. Which vse continued a long time, vn∣till women, by renouncing the world, and liuing monasticall religious liues, got such an honourable esteeme in the world, that they were thought no lesse worthie of honour, in that kinde, then men; and when as a widow d ed hauing h d but one husband, they carried her to her graue with a crowne of chastitie vpon her head. Condemned persons (as they are now adayes) were carried in waines or carts, because they were thought vnworthy to bee borne by men, who, by their wicked demerits, had procured the hand of iustice to cut them off, by vntimely death, from the societie of men. CHAP. IIII. Of the excessiue expenses bestowed at Funeralls in former times. I Might include within this Chapter, and not impertinently, to these con∣tents, the ancient customes, and manners of burying the dead, in all Na∣tions, throughout all the habitable world: but that would make the gate bigger then the citie, this discourse of a greater bulke, then all the rest of the booke besides: you may finde this Treatise touched vpon, in the Volumne of the Estates, Empires, and Principalities of the world; as also in the Trea∣surie of Ancient and moderne Times, the sixth booke; where hee speakes of diuers customes and fashions of buriall, of ancient obsequies, and their ceremonies; onely then a little of so much, because I would not stray be∣yond my limits. The ancient Romanes did vse them that were dead after two manners, and they had two kindes of obsequies: the first and most ancient was to couer the dead with earth, and to bury them as we doe; the other, to burne their bodies, but this manner did not continue long. Sepeliri antiquius fu∣isse quam cremari. Plin. lib. 7. cap. 54. Cremari apud Romanos non suit ve∣ eris instituti, terra condebantur: at postquam longinquis hellis obrutos eru cognouere, est institutum, & tamen multae familiae priscos seruauere ritus. Manut. de leg. Rom. sol. 125. Numa Pompilius was the inuenter of obse∣quies, and hee instituted a high Priest, who had the charge. The first ho∣nour which they vsed to performe in the obsequies of famous persons, was to commend the partie by an Oration. Valerius Publicola made a funerall oration on the death and in the praise of Brutus. In like manner Iulius Cae∣sar, being but twelue yeares old, commended his grandfather: and Tiberius at the age of nine yeares praised his father. The second honour was to make Sword-players to fight. Marcus and Decius sonnes to Iunius Brutus, were the first that did practise this, in honour of their father. The third honour was, to make a feast of magnificent furnishment. The fourth was a distri∣bution of meat to all the common people. And such (as I haue said before) as could not be buried with the like, and so great pompe (for the expenses were in supportable) were buried in the night time, by the Vespillons clo∣thed all in white, who carried the dead body to his graue. They had like∣wise an order, that within some while after the obsequies, they would strew diuers flowers, and sweet odours, upon the sepulchre, as the Romane people did vpon the funerall monument of Scipio. And also they accustomed yearely, to garnish, decke, and adorne, the tombes or graues of the dead, with poesies, crownes, and garlands of all sorts of flowers. Husbands (saith Saint Ierom ad Pammachum ) were wont to straw, spread, or scatter ouer, and vpon the graues and sepulchres of their deceased deare wiues, violets, roses, lillies, hyacinths, and diuers purple flowers: by which vxorious of∣fice, they did mitigate, and lessen the griefe of their hearts conceiued by the losse of their louing bedf llowes. The like expression of mutuall loue wiues shewed to their buried husbands. Now aboue all flowers in these ceremonious obseruances, the Rose was in greatest request, and had the sole preheminence. Romani (saith Kirkman de Funeribus Romanorum, lib. 4. cap. 3.) verò Rosarum fuere studiosi, vt ijs post mortem monimenta sua spargi supremo iudicio nonnunquam iusserint, legato ad hanc rem relict , cui plerumque haec erat conditio (ut in Rauenna∣ti inscriptione legimus) vt quotannis Rosas ad monumentum eius de errent, ibi{que} epularentur. To which Io. Passeratius in his Rosa, thus alludes. Manibus est imis Rosa grata, & grata Sepulchris, Et Rosa flos Florum. Vnto the Tombes and Spirits of the dead The Rose is gratefull, of all flowers the head. And Anacreon in praise of the Rose thus sings in one of his odes: I will vse the Latine translation. Rosa, honor, decusque florum Rosa, cura amorque veris Rosa, coelitum voluptas: And in another ode in commendation of the Rose more aptly to this pur∣pose, thus. Medicatur haec & aegris, Defendit haec sepultos▪ The Rose full many griefes doth cure, Defends corps laid in sepulture. The ancient Ethnicks did hold the springing of flowers, from the graue of a deceased friend, an argument of his happinesse; and it was their vni∣uersall wish, That the Tombe stones of their dead friends might bee light vnto them; and that a perpetuall spring-tide, of all kinde of fragrant flow¦ers, might incircle their verdant graues. According to this of Persius. Sat. 7. Dij maiorum vmbris tenuem & sine pondere terram Spirantesque crocos, & in vrna perpetuum ver. Lie earth light on their bones, may their graues beare Fresh fragrant flowers: let springtide still liue there. But to come backe againe. The magnificence in burning the bodies of the dead, did farre exceed in charges all other kindes of funerall; for which the bodies of persons of principall regard (as you may reade in the Tra∣uelles of George Sandys ) they burnt rich odours, gold, iewels, apparell, heards of cattell, flocks of sheepe, horses, hounds, and sometimes the con∣cubines and slaues whom they most respected, to supply their wants, to serue their delights, and attend vpon them in the lower shades. The expres∣s of such a funerall fire, wherein the body of Archemorus was con∣sumed, is thus set downe by Statius the Theban; in his sixth booke, trans∣lated by Sandys. Neuer were ashes with more wealth repleate; Gems crackle, siluer melts, gold drops with heate: Embroidered robes consume. Okes, fatned by The iuyce of sweet Assyrian drugs, flame hie: Fyer'd honey, and pale saffron hisse: full boules Of wine pour'd on, and goblets (gladding soules) Of blacke bloud, and snatcht milke. The Greeke Kings then With Guidons trail'd on earth, led forth their men In seuen troupes: in each troupe an hundred Knights Circling the sad pile with sinister rites: Who choke the flame with dust. Thrice it they round Their weapons clash: foure times a horrid sound Strucke armours raisde: as oft the Seruants beate Their bared breasts, with out-cries. Heards of Neate, And beasts halfe slaine, another wastfull fire Deuoures, &c. With the like solemnitie, or farre greater, the funerals of Patroclus were performed by Achilles, for with him were burned, oxen, sheepe, dogges, horses, and twelue stout and valiant sonnes of noble Troians. Achilles pulls off the haire off his head, and casts it into the flame; and besides in∣stitutes certaine Funerall Games to the honour of his slaine friend, the glory of the Greekish Nation, Patroclus which is recorded by Homer in the 23. booke of his Iliads; of which this is the argument: Achilles orders iusts of Obsequies, For his Patroclus, and doth sacrifice Twelue Troian Princes: most lou'd hounds, and horse, And other offering to the honoured corse. He institutes besides a Funerall Game, Where Diomed for horse-race wins the same. For foot, Vlysses; other otherwise Striue, and obtaine, and end the Exequies. They vsed to quench these funerall fires with red wine, and gathering the bones together, to include them in vrnes, which they placed in or vpon some sumptuous rich Monument, erected for that purpose, as you may reade in the sixth booke of Virgils Aen iads, Aene Trump . in the funeralls of Misenus, most liuely thus expressed. I will vse Phaers Translation. —the Troians all in solemne guise Did waile Misenus corps, and gaue to him their last outcries. First cut in culpons great, and fat of sappe, with pitch among, A stately pile they build, with timber trees and Cypresse strong, (That dead mens treasure is) his gorgeous armes also they set; Some brought the water warme, and Cauldrons boyling out they set. The body cold they wash, and precious ointments on they poure; Lamenting loud is made, then close his limbes in bed, or floore, They crouch with weeping teares, and purple weedes on him they throw: His robes, his harne is bright, and ensignes all that men may know. In mourning sort some heaue on shoulders high the mighty Beere, (A dolefull seruice sad) as children doe their father deere, Behinde them holding brands, then flame vprising broad doth spread, And oiles and dainties cast, and Frankincence the fire doth feed. When falne his cinders were, and longer blase did not endure; His reliques and remaines of dust, with wine they washed pure, Then Choriney his bones in brasen coffin bright did close. And sprinkling water pure, about his mates three times he goes: And drops of sacred dew, with Oliue-palmes on them did shake, And compasse blest them all, and sentence last he sadly spake: To fields of ioy thy soule, and endlesse rest we doe betake. But good Aeneas then, right huge in height his Tombe did rere, And gaue the Lord his Armes, his Ore and Trumpet fixed there, On mountaine neare the skies, that of Misenus beares the name, And euerlasting shall from world to world retaine the same. Many more ceremonies were obserued in the magnificent ordering of both kindes of Funeralls, as well of such as were buried in the earth, as of these burned in these costly piles of wood. The custome of burning the dead bodies continued among the Romanes, but vntill the time of the An∣tonine Emperours, An Do 200. or thereabouts: then they began to burie againe in the earth. Manutius de log. Rom. fol 125.126. They had, at these burials, suborned counterfeit hired mourners, which were women of the loudest voices, who betimes in the morning did meere at appointed places, and then cried out mainly, beating of their breasts, tearing their haire, their faces, and garments, ioyning therewith the pray∣ers of the defunct, from the houre of his natiuitie, vnto the houre of his dissolution; still keeping time with the melancholicke musicke. (This is a custome obserued at this day in some parts of Ireland, but aboue all Na∣tions the Iewes are best skilled in these lamentations, being Fruitfull in teares: Inuen. teares, that still ready stand To sally forth, and but expect command.) Amongst these women there was euer an old aged Beldam, Rosin. de Autin Romano. l. . cap. 59. called Praefica, quasi in hoc ipso manus praefecta, a superintendent aboue all the rest of the mourners: who with a loud voice did pronounce these words: I licet, or, Ire licet ; as much to say, He must needs depart: and when the dead corps were lain in the graue, and all ceremonies finished, she deliuerd the last adieu in this manner, Vale, vale, vale, nos te ordine, quo natura permiserit, cuncti sequemur: Adieu, Adieu, Adieu, wee must follow thee, according as the course of nature shall permit vs. The manner of these lamentings (saith George Sandys in his Journall) may of old appeare by this ironicall personating of a father following the exequies of his sonne, introducted by Lucian in these words: O my sweet sonne, thou art lost, thou art dead: dead before thy day, and hast left mee behinde, of men the most miserable. Not experienced in the pleasures of a wife, the comforts of children, warfare, husbandrie, nor attained to ma∣turitie. Henceforth, O my sonne, thou shalt not eate, nor loue, nor bee drunke amongst thy equalls. They had likewise their Libitinarij (and those many in number) which were the prouiders of all things necessarie for the Funeralls; and their Pollinctores, which were those that anointed, em∣balmed, and inuested the defunct, with mirrhe, aloes, salt, honey, waxe, sweet odours, pretious oyles, perfumed sereclothes, fine Aromaticke Sin∣don, and the like. The mourners were exceeding many, (of which I haue partly spoken before) with Trumpeters, and Musitians of all sorts, most dolefully sounding, and warbling forth their lamentable notes: the corps of the defunct being garded, and attended vpon, with troupes of horse∣men, which was accounted an extraordinarie kinde of honour done to the deceased: then last of all, Funerall Games, Bonefires of most pretious woods, Orations, magnificent, sumptuous, and most royall feasts and ban∣quets were ordained. But these excessiue charges, these superfluous and impertinent costs of funerall expenses, were by certaine Lawes restrained, both by the Romans, and Grecians, and funerall charges proportioned, according to the wor∣thinesse of the person deceased, and his meanes; answerable to the valua∣tion of his yearely reuenues, or the generall estimate of his substance. In like manner these Ethnicke lamentations, and fearefull howlings for the dead, by hired mourners, were prohibited; yet moderate weeping and mourning at Funeralls, was neuer dissallowed; nay it hath been euer highly commended, accounted the chiefe grace of Funerals, promised for a bles∣sing to the godly, and the want thereof, a malediction or curse; and mo∣derately to mourne after the interment of our friends, is a manifest token of true loue; by it wee expresse that naturall affection wee had to the de∣parted, with a Christian-like moderation of our griefe, whereby our faith to God ward is demonstrated. For as God hath made vs liuing, so hath he made vs louing creatures, to the end we should not be as stocks and stones, voide of all kinde and naturall affection, but that liuing and louing together, the loue of the one should not end with the life of the other. And now to go a little further, I say, that to mourne and sorrow for parents, children, husbands, wiues, kindred and friends, is not any matter of noueltie but most ancient. Gen. 1 . Abraham mourned and wept for his wife Sarah: Dauid could not hide his fatherly affection toward his sonne Absolon ; although he was a traitour to his father, 2. Sam. 18. Dauid the King: for so soone as hee heard of his death, he went up to the chamber ouer the gate (as the text is) and wept: and as hee went, thus he said, O my sonne Absolon, my sonne, my sonne Ab∣solon, would God I had died for thee, O Absolon, my sonne, my sonne. Dauid also hearing of the death of murdered Abner, whom he respected as a deare friend: said vnto Ioab (who slew Abner ) and to all the people that were with him, 2▪ Sam. 5. Rent your clothes and put on sackcloth, and mourne, before the corps of Abner : and king Dauid himselfe followed the Beere. And when they had buried Abner in Hebron, the king lifted vp his voice, and wept beside the Sepulchre of Abner, and all the people wept. Now, it being the custome of the Israelites to feast and banquet at their burials; he people came to cause Dauid (such is the Scripture phrase) to eate meate while it was yet day, but Dauid sware, saying, So doe God to me and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else till the Sunne bee downe: and a l the people knew it, and it pleased them, saith the Text. Our a l perfect and Almighty Sauiour Christ Iesus, Ioh. 11. wept ouer the graue of dead Lazarus (whom he reuiued) wherupon the standers by said among themselues, behold how he loued him. The ancient Romanes, before they were Christians, mourned nine moneths, but being Christians, they vsed mourning a whole yeare, clothed in blacke for the most part, for women were clothed partly in white, and partly in blacke, according to the diuersitie of Nations. And if any Chri∣stian, man, or woman, in those parts, wearing mourning, came to agree againe in a second marriage, during the yeare appointed for mourning, the Matrimony was stayed, but thenceforward hee nor shee were bound to weare any more mourning. These examples considered, I obserue that wee, in these dayes, doe not weepe and mourne at the departure of the dead, so much, nor so long, as in Christian dutie we ought. For husbands can burie their wiues, and wiues their husbands, with a few counterfeit teares, and a sowre visage masked and painted ouer with dissimulation; contracting second marriages, before they haue worne out their mourning garments, and sometimes before their cope mates be cold in their graues. Young heires may attend vpon the corps of their parents to their buri∣all places, seemingly making great shewes of inward griefe and sorrow, but Haeredis flectus sub persona risus est. Aul. G ll. Noct. Att. lib. 17. c. 14. The weeping of an heire, is laughing vnder a visard or disguise. And if his father haue impaired, or not augmented his state and inhe∣ritance, this young master will reduce the conuoy of his fathers obsequies, to some vnwonted parsimonie, answerable to these verses of Persius in the sixth and last Satyre. —if thou impaire thy wealth, thy angred heire Of thy last funerall feast will take small care: And with neglect into thy vrne will throw Thy bones without perfumes, carelesse to know Whether he buy dull-smelling Cinnamum, Or Casia corrupt with cherry gumme. Now howsoeuer the procuration of funerals, the manner of buriall, the pompe of obsequies, bee rather comforts to the liuing, then helpes to the dead; and although all these ceremonies be despised by our parents on their death-beds; yet should they not be neglected by vs their children, or nearest of kindred, vpon their interments. But funerals in any expensiue way here with vs, are now accounted but as a fruitlesse vanitie, insomuch that almost all the ceremoniall rites of ob∣sequies heretofore vsed, are altogether laid aside: for wee see daily that No¦blemen, and Gentlemen of eminent ranke, office, and qualitie, are either silently buried in the night time, with a Torch, a two-penie Linke, and a Lanterne; or parsimoniously interred in the day-time, by the helpe of some ignorant countrey-painter, without the attendance of any one of the Offi¦cers of Armes, whose chiefest support, and maintenance, hath euer depend∣ed vpon the performance of such funerall rites, and exequies. So that now by reason of this generall neglect of Funeralls, and the sleight regard wee haue of the needfull vse of Heraulds, many and great errours are daily com∣mitted, to the great offence and preiudice of the ancient Nobilitie, and Gen∣trie of this Kingdome, and to the breeding of many ambiguous doubts and questions, which may happen in their Descents, and issues in future ages: And nothing will be shortly left to continue the memory of the deceased to posteritie; pilfery and the opinion some haue, that Tombes, and their Epi∣taphs, taste somewhat of Poperie, hauing already most sacrilegiously stolne, erazed, and taken away, almost all the Inscriptions and Epitaphs, cut, writ, inlaid, or engrauen vpon the Sepulchres of the deceased; and most shamefully defaced the glorious rich Tombes, and goodly monuments of our most worthy Ancestours. It could bee wished that some order might betaken for the preseruation of these few which are as yet remaining: for to mine owne knowledge, by the obseruation I haue made in many Churches, the Monuments of the dead are daily thus abused. CHAP. V. The reasons wherefore so many haue made their owne Monuments in their life-time. Of the care that all or most of all men haue of decent buriall. The buriall of the dead, a worke acceptable vnto God. A funerall Hymne of Aurelius Prudentius to the like purpose. IT was vsuall in ancient times, and so it is in these our dayes, for persons of especiall ranke and qualitie to make their owne Tombes and Monu∣ments in their life-time; partly for that they might haue a certaine house to put their head in (as the old saying is) whensoeuer they should bee ta∣ken away by death, out of this their Tenement, the world; and partly to please themselues, in the beholding of their dead countenance in marble. But most especially because thereby they thought to preserue their memo∣ries from obliuion. Absolon in his life time, erected a pillar, to retaine the memory of his name, in that his issue male failed. Will you heare the Text. 2. Sam. c . 8 Now Absolon in his life-time had taken, and reared him vp a pillar, which is in the Kings dale: for hee said, I haue no sonne to keepe my name in re∣membrance, and hee called the pillar after his owne name, and it is called vnto this day, Absolons place. This pillar, which Absolon intended for the place of his sepulture, hewne and framed out of the rocke or growing stone, is to bee seene at this day, saith Sandys, all entire and of a goodly fabricke. But to returne, euery man like Absolon desires a perpetuity after death, by these monuments, or by other meanes, Cap. 4. according to that of Tertullian in his booke, De Testimonio animae. Quis non hodie (saith hee) memoriae post mortem frequentandae ita studet, vt vel literaturae operibus, vel simplici laude morum, vel ipsorum se∣pulchrorum ambitione, nomen suum seruet? These that in their life time do thus build their owne sepulchres, and take care in the ceremonious dis∣posing of their funeralls, would (no question) lay this charge vpon those which they must of necessity trust, in the performance of their Wills and Testaments, and employ their last dayes and houres in more heauenly de∣signes; if they did not oftentimes see in their course of life, that as well heires as executours, interre both the honour and memory of the defunct, together with his corps: perfidiously forgetting their fidelity to the de∣ceased. Of which will it please you reade this old inscription depicted vpon a wall within S. Edmunds Church in Lumbard-street, London. Man, the behovyth oft to haue this. yis in mind, that. Yat thow geueth wyth thine. yin hond, yat sall thow fynd, For widowes be sloful, and chyldren beth vnkynd, Executors beth couetos, and kep al yat they. yey fynd. If eny body esk wher the deddys goodys becam. they answer. Yey ansquer So God me help and halidam, he died a poor man, thinke on this. Yink on yis Io. Gower in his additions to his booke called Vox clamantis, Mss. in. Bib. Cott. hath these verses, contra mortuorum Executores, much what to the same effect. Dicunt Scripture memorare nouissima vite, Pauper ab hoc mundo transiet omnis homo. Dat Fortuna status varios, Natura sed omnes Fine suo claudit, cuncta{que} morte rapit. Post mortem pauci qui nunc reputantur amici, Sunt memores: anime sis memor ipse tue. Da dum tempus habes, tibi propria sit manus heres; Auferet hoc nemo quod dabis ipse Deo. Vpon these and the like considerations, they vsed (as they now doe) to in∣scribe or engraue these kinde of monuments with certaine sentences to this effect. Fallax saepe fides, testataque vota peribunt: Constitues tumulum, si sapis, ipse tuum. Or thus. Certa dies nulli, mors certa, incerta sequentum Cura: locet tumulum qui sapit ipse sibi. Concluding most commonly with these words. Viuus fecit. Viuus faciendum curauit. Viuus sibi posuit. Se vino fecit. Vi∣uus hoc sibi fecit monumentum: and the like. Some erected their sepulchres whilst they were liuing, concluding their inscriptions thus. Sibi & coniugi. Sibi, coniugi & Liberis. Sibi & posteris. And some that would not haue their wiues heires nor any other entombed therein, thus. Hoc monumentum heredes non sequuntur. Or thus: Rogo per deos superos inferosque ossa nostra ne violes. This care of buriall moued Augustus Caesar to build his funerall monu∣ment, in the sixth yeare of his Consulship; for himselfe, and the succeeding Emperours. The like reason moued Hadrian to build his Tombe or Sepulchre neare vnto the bridge Aelium, for the Mausoleum of Augustus was full; as Xiphi∣linus writes in the life of Hadrian. And to bring you this honie example, the like consideration moued King Henry the seuenth, in the eighteenth yeare of his raigne, to build that glorious faire Chappell at Westminster, for an house of buriall, for him∣selfe, his children, and such onely of the bloud-royall, as should descend from his Ioynes; forbidding that any other of what degree or qualitie soe uer, should euer be interred in that sacred mould; as appeares by his last Will and Testament. De Ci t. Dei. ca. 1 . Saint Augustine saith, that the Funerals of the righteous, in the times of old, were performed with a zealous care, their burials celebrated, and their Monuments prouided in their life time. R maines. Great hath been the care of buriall (saith Camden ) euer since the first times, insomuch that Fathers would lay charges vpon their children, con∣cerning the buriall, and translating of their bodies, euery one being desi∣rous to returne, in Sepulchra maiorum, into the sepulchres of their An∣cestours. Gen. 49.50. Iacob at his death charged his sonne Ioseph to carry his body into the se∣pulchre of his fathers. And Ioseph himselfe commanded his brethren that they should remember and tell their pos eritie, that when they went away into the land of promise, they should carry his bones thither with them. Abraham, Isaac, Iacob, Sarah, Rebecca, Leah, and Ioseph, were buried to∣gether in one Sepulchre. The kings of Aegypt accustomed to awe their subiects by threatning to depriue them of buriall. And it was a penaltie of the law amongst the Ro∣manes. He that doth this, or that, let him be cast forth vnburied; and so in the declamations; He that forsakes his parents in their necessities, let him be cast forth vnburied; An Homicide, let him be cast forth vnburied. And so speakes Cicero to the peoples humour for Milo, when hee affirmes his carcase to be more wretched, because it wanted the solemne rites of funerall. Commanders in warres vsed to terrifie their enemies with the want of buriall, according to this speech of Hector in the fifteenth booke of Homers Iliads. T ans. by George Chap∣man ▪ Then Hector cri'd out, take no spoile, but rush on to the fleete, From whose assault (for spoile nor flight) if any man I meete, He meetes his death: nor in the fire of holy funerall, His brothers nor his sisters hands shall cast within our wall, His lothed body; but without, the throtes of dogs shall graue His manlesse limbes. The people of Israel, crying vnto God against the barbarous tyranny of the Babylonians, who spoiled Gods inheritance, polluted his Temple, de∣stroyed his religion, and murdered his chosen Nation; amongst other ca∣lamities, thus they complaine for the want of sepulture. The dead bodies of thy seruants haue they giuen to be meat vnto fowles of the heauen; Psal. 79. and the flesh of thy Saints vnto the beasts of the earth. Their bloud haue they shed like waters, round about Ierusalem, and there was none to bury them. God commands Elias to tell Iezebel, that, for her wickednesse, the dogs should eate vp her flesh in the field of Iesreel ; 2. King 9. and that her carcase should be as doung vpon the ground, in the said field of Iesreel: so that none should say, this is Iezebel. The seduced Prophet, 1. King 13. because he disobeyed the mouth of the Lord, was reproued by him who was the occasion of his errour, as hee had it in com∣mandement from God; and withall told, that his carcase should not come vnto the sepulcher of his Fathers. Esay speaking in derision of the death and sepulture of the king of Baby∣lon, Chap. 14.18, 19, 20. which was not with his Fathers, for that his tyranny was so much ab∣horred; thus noteth his vnhappinesse. All the kings of the nations, euen they all sleepe in glorie euery one in his owne house. But thou art cast out of thy graue like an abhominable branch: like the rayment of those that are slaine, and thrust through with a sword, which go downe to the stones of the pit, as a carcase troden vnder feet. Thou shalt not be ioyned with them in the graue. Ieremie the Prophet speaking against the breakers of Gods sacred coue∣nants, brings in (most commonly) the want of buriall, as a punishment for such their hainous offences as followeth. Thus saith the Lord, Ier. 34.20. I will euen giue them into the hands of their ene∣mies, and into the hands of them that seeke their life; and their dead bodies shall bee for meat vnto the fowles of the heauen, and to the beasts of the earth. And prophesying against Iehoakim ; he is inspired with these words. Thus saith the Lord against Iehoakim, Ier 22.18.19. the sonne of Iosiah king of Iuda: they shall not lament him, saying, Ah my brother, or ah sister, neither shall they mourne for him, saying, Ah, Lord, or ah, his glory. He shall be buri∣ed, as an asse is buried; (not honourably (saith the Margent) among his fa∣thers) euen drawne and cast forth without the gates of Ierusalem. In other places of his prophesie, thus. They shall die of deaths, Ier. 16.4. and diseases they shall not bee lamented, nei∣ther shall they be buried, but they shall be as doung vpon the earth. They shall be cast out in the streets of Ierusalem, Ier. 14.16. because of the famine, and the sword, and there shall be none to burie them: both they and their wiues, their sonnes and their daughters; for I will poure their wickednesse vpon them. Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Ier. 19.7. I will cause them to fall by the sword, be∣fore their enemies, and by the hand of them that seeke their liues: and their carcases will I giue to bee meate for the fowles of the heauen, and to the beasts of the field. We haue diuers examples of this nature in the holy Scriptures. But let vs go no further then to the lawes of our owne Nation, by which the sub∣iect is kept in awfull obedience. Hee that commits treason, is adiudged by our Lawes, to bee hanged, drawne, and quartered, and his diuided limbes to be set vpon poles in some eminent place, within some great Market-towne, or Citie. He that commits that crying sinne of murther, is vsually hanged vp in chaines, so to continue vntill his bodie be consumed, at or neare the place where the fact was perpetrated. Such as are found guilty of other criminall causes, as Burglarie, Felonie, or the like, after a little hanging are cut downe and indeed buried, but sel∣dome in Christian mould (as we say) nor in the sepulchres of their fathers, except their fathers had their graues made neare, or vnder the gallowes. And we vse to bury such as lay violent hands vpon themselues, in or neare to the high wayes, with a stake thrust through their bodies, to terrifie all passengers, by that so infamous and reproachfull a buriall; not to make such their finall passage out of this present world. The feare of not hauing buriall, or hauing of ignominious and dishonou¦rable buriall, hath euer affrighted the brauest spirits of the world▪ this feare made the dying Mezentius make this request to his enemy Aeneas. Virg. Ae . l . 10. No ill in death: not so came I to sight: Nor made my Lausus such a match. One right Afford (if pitie stoope t a vanq sht foe) Interre m corps. Much hate of mine I know Surrounds me. Dead from that fear'd furie saue: And lay me with my sonne, both in one graue. This feare made the faire-helm'd Hector (as Homer calls him) being rea∣die to combat with Ajax Telamon, to propound this couenant. Amongst you all whose breast includes the most expulsiue minde, Let him stand forth, as Combatant, by all the rest design'd, Before whome thus I call high Ioue, to witnesse of our strife: If he with home-thrust-iron can reac th'exposure of my life, (Spoiling my armes) let him at will conuay them to his tent. But let my body be renurn'd, that Troys two-stept descent M y see it in the funerall pile: if I can slaughter him, (Apollo honouring me so much) I'le spoile his conquered limbe: And beare his armes to Ilion, where in Apollos Shrine I'le hang them as my Trophies due: his body I'le resigne To e disposed by his friends, in flamie Funeralls; And h nour'd with erected Tombe, where Hellespontus fals Into Aegaeum, and doth reach euen to your nauall rode. That when our beings in the earth shall hide their period, Epitas um per anticipat onem. Suruiuers sailing the blacke sea, may thus his name renew: This is his Monument, whose bloud long since did fates imbrew, Whom passing farre in fortitude, illustrate Hector slew. This shall posteritie report, and my fame neuer die. Cicero, in his second booke, De gloria, makes Aiax (glorious in armes) to intreate Hector, that if it were his fortune, to be vanquisht by him so renowned an enemy; he would affoord his body worthie and honoura∣ble buriall, and that his Tombe to succeeding ages, might thus speake to all passengers. Hic situs est vitae iampridem lumina linquens, Aul. Gell. Noc Att. li. . Cui quondam Hectoreo perculsus concidit ense, Fabitur haec aliquis, mea semper gloria vines. Here he lies depriu'd of light, Slaine by Hectors sword in fight: Some one will euer tell this story; So endlesse shall be Aiax glory. Achilles, hauing giuen Hector his deaths wound, insulted ouer him (as it is in the two and twentieth booke of Homers Iliads) thus. —And now the dogs and fowles, in oulest vse Shall teare thee vp, thy corse expos'd to all the Greekes abuse. To whom Hector makes his dying request on this manner. He fainting said, let me implore, euen by thy knees, and soule, And thy great parents; doe not see a cruelty so foule, Inflicted on me; brasse and gold receiue at any rate, And quit my person, that the Peeres, and Ladies of our State May tombe it. Thus you see how much the most heroicall spirits desir'd the honour of sepulture, with the performance of all funerall rites; howsoeuer Lucan in his fifth booke of the Pharsalian warres, makes Iulius Caesar (being as then in danger to be drowned) to expostulate with the Gods, and (in a boasting manner) to contemne all funerall exequies. Concluding thus. —O Gods I craue No Funerall: let the seas vtmost waue Keepe my torne carcase, let me want a Tombe And funerall pile, whilest look't for still to come Into all Lands I am, and euer fear'd. But this was but one of Caesars rodamantadoes, or thundring declamations in a storme, onely to his poore Bargeman Amyclas, being as then out of all hope or helpe for buriall, saue in the bottome of the sea; otherwise at ano∣ther time, I do not doubt but that he would haue desired sepulture with all her ceremonies, as earnestly as Hector or any one of his nine fellow-wor∣thies. For neuer any (saith Camden ) neglected buriall but some sauage na∣tions; Remaines. as Bactrians, which cast their dead to the dogs; some varlet Philo∣sophers, as Diogenes, who desired to bee deuoured of fishes; some dissolute Courtiers; as Macaenas who was wont to say, Non tumulum curo sepelit natura relictos. I'm carelesse of a graue: Nature her dead will saue. As another said. De terra interram, & quaeuis terra Sepulchrum. From earth to earth wee go; Each earths alike graue so. Lucius Scipio likewise, being ouerthrowne at the battell of Thapsus, where hee was Generall, fled disguisedly by sea for his owne safety, but be∣ing driuen by a storme into the Bay of Hippo, where Caesars Nauie lay to guard the shores, and perceiuing them himselfe and his Barke both lost; he stabbed himselfe with his ponyard, leapt ouerboard, and drowned himselfe in the maine; vttering vpon his instant resolution certaine words in dis∣daine of buriall. Thomas May, lib. 4. Thus exquisitely deliuered in verse by my worthy Friend the continuer of Lucans Historicall poeme. My course is runne; and, though this armed hand Shall testifie I could haue di'd by land, The Ocean likes me best; within the maine Vnknowne for euer Scipio shall remaine: O let my floating carcase neuer come To land, lest Affricke should bestow a Tombe, And to her sonnes in after ages show A Monument of vanquisht Scipio. Loath he was that his dead bodie should either suffer despight, or receiue fauour from his enemies; so that I thinke no otherwise of his imprecations then I do of Caesars. These carelesse Mecaenas -like resolutions, make so many (I beleeue) of es∣peciall note amongst us; who either vpon a sparing or precise humour, are content to commit to the earth, their parents, wiues, children, and the nea∣rest vnto them, in tenebris, with little better than Sepulchra asinorum. This office of burying the dead, this last dutie done to our deceased friends, hath euer had the prime place of commendation by Lucan, lib. 18. for that he, so solicitously tooke care to giue all funerall dues, to the head lesse Trunke of great Pompey, cut off by the treachery of the vngrat full base Ptolomey ; vpon whom he is made in the said booke to bestow this Epitaph. Here the great Pompey lies, so Fortune pleasde, To instile this stone; whom Caesars selfe would haue Interr'd, before he should haue mist a graue. And Virgil makes buriall an honour to such as are slaine in battell, and so consequently of others. Meane while th'vnburied bodies of our mates Ciue wee to graue, sole honour after fates. Go honour those braue soules, with their last dues, Who with their bloud purchas'd this land for vs. Toby his burying of the dead was acceptable vnto God, as the Angell testifieth. And the Lord himselfe, being to arise againe the third day, com∣mended that good worke of those religious women, who poured those pretious ointments, with sweete odours, vpon his head and body, and did it to bury him. And the Gospel hath crowned them with immortall praise, that tooke downe his bodie from the crosse, and gaue it honest and honou∣rable buriall. Lib. 1. de Ciuit Dei. cap. 11. Which signifieth, saith S. Augustine, that the providence of God extendeth euen vnto the very bodies of the dead (for he is pleased with such good deeds) and doe build vp the beleefe of the resurrection. Where, by the way (saith he) we may learne this profitable lesson; how great the reward of almes done vnto the liuing may be, since this duty and fauour showne, but vnto the dead, is not forgotten of God. Decent buriall, according to the qualitie of the person deceased, with attendants of kindred and friends, is an honour to the defunct. Hezekiah (saith the text) slept with his fathers, 2. Chro 2.3 and they buried him in the highest sepulchre of the sonnes of Dauid: and all Iudah, and the inha∣bitants of Ierusalem, did him honour at his death. We commend (many of vs I am sure doe) that good worke of Richard Fox, Bishop of Winchester, who caused the bones, and other reliques of such sacred Princes, and sainted Prelates, as there had beene buried in that Church, and dispersed abroad in seuerall odde corners, to bee placed toge∣ther in seemly monuments, vpon the top of the new partition built by him∣selfe for the same purpose. And likewise wee cannot but loue the memory of such, who vpon the dissolution, and finall destruction of our religious structures, caused so ma∣ny funerall monuments, with the bodies therein included, to bee remoued into other neighbouring Churches, where by all likelihood, they may rest in peace and safety, vntill the last sound of the Trumpet. In the works of Aurelius Prudentius Clemens (a Spaniard by birth, an ancient Christian Poet, Pet Opmer. opu Chronog ad. An. 408. and one, Qui palmam inter omnes Christianos Poetas obtinuit ; who flourished about foure hundred yeares after the in∣carnation of our Lord and Sauiour) I finde this Funerall Hymne follow∣ing, of which (and not impertinently) I may make some vse here in this place, translated by Sir Iohn Beaumont Baronet. O God, Hym. 10. the soules pure fiery spring, Who different natures wouldst combine: That man whom thou to life didst bring; By weakenesse may to death decline. By thee they both are fram'd aright, They by thy hand vnited be; And while they ioyne with growing might, Both flesh and spirit liue to thee: But when diuision them recalls, They bend their course to seu'rall ends; Into drie earth the body falls, The feruent soule to heau'n ascends: For all created things at length, By slow corruption growing old, Must needs forsake compacted strength, And disagreeing webs vnfold. But thou, deare Lord, hast meanes prepar'd, That death in thine may neuer reigne, And hast vndoubted wayes declar'd, How members lost may rise againe: That while those generous rayes are bound In prison vnder fading things; That part may still be stronger found, Which from aboue directly springs. If man with baser thoughts possest, His will in earthly mud shall drowne; The soule with such a weight opprest, Is by the body carried downe: But when she mindfull of her birth, Her selfe from vgly spots debarres; She lifts her friendly house from earth, And beares it with her to the starres. See how the emptie bodie lies, Where now no liuely soule remaines; Yet when short time with swiftnesse flies, The height of senses it regaines▪ Those ages shall be soone at hand, When kindly heate the bones reuiues; And shall the former house command, Where liuing bloud it shall infuse. Dull carcases to dust now worne, Which long in graues corrupted lay, Shall to the nimble aire be borne, Where soules before haue led the way. Hence comes it to adorne the graue, With carefull labour men affect: The limbes dissolu'd last honour haue, And fun'rall Rites with pompe are deckt. The custome is to spread abroad White linens, grac'd with splendour pure, Sabaean myrrhe on bodies strow'd Preserues them from decay secure. The hollow stones by caruers wrought▪ Which in faire Monuments are laid, Declare that pledges thither brought, Are not to death, but sleepe conuay'd. The pious Christians thus ordaine, Beleeuing with a prudent eye That those shall rise and liue againe, Who now in freezing slumbers lie. He that the dead (dispers'd in fields) In pitie hides, with heapes of molds, To his Almighty Sauiour yeelds A worke, which he with ioy beholds: The same Law warnes vs all to grone, Whom one seuere condition ties, And in anothers death to mone All fun'rals, as of our allies. That reuerend man in goodnesse bred, Who blest Tobias did beget, Preferr'd the buriall of the dead Before his meate, though ready set; He, while the seruants waiting stand, Forsakes the cups, the dishes leaues, And digges a graue with speedy hand, Which with the bones his teares receiues. Rewards from heau'n t is worke requite: No slender price is here repaid, God cleares the eyes that saw no light, While fishes gall on them is laid. Then the Creatour would descry How farre from reason they are led Who sharpe and bitter things apply, To soules on which new light is spred. He also taught that to no wight, The heau'nly kingdome can be seene, Till vext with wounds and darksome night, He in the worlds rough waues ath beene▪ The curse of death a blessing findes; Because by this tormenting woe Steepe wayes lie plaine to spotlesse mindes, Who to the Starres by s rrowes goe. The bodies which long perisht lay, Returne to liue in better yeares, That vnion neuer shall decay, Where after death new warmth appeares. The face where now pale colour dwels, Whence foule infection shall arise, The flowers in splendour then excels, When bloud the skinne with beauty dies. No age by Times imperious law, With enuious prints the forehead dimmes: No drought, no leannesse then can draw The moisture from the withered limbes. Diseases which the body eate, Infected with oppressing paines, In midst of torments then shall sweate, Imprison'd in a thousand chaines. The conquering flesh immortall growes, Beholding from the skies aboue, The endlesse groning of her foes, For sorrowes which from them did moue. Why are vndecent howlings mixt By liuing men in such a case? Why are decre s so sweetly fixt? Reprou'd with discontented face? Let all complaints and murmures faile; Ye tender mothers stay your teares, Let none their children deare bewaile, For life renew'd in death appeares. So buried seeds, though drie and dead, Againe with smiling greennesse spring: And from the hollow furrowes bred, Attempt new eares of corne to bring. Earth, take this man with kinde embrace, In thy soft bosome him conceiue: For humane members here I place, And gen rous parts in trust I leaue. This house, the soule her guest once felt, Which from the Makers mouth proceeds: Here sometime feruent wisedome dwelt; Which Christ the Prince of wisedome breeds. A cou'ring for this body make, The Author neuer will forget His works; nor will those lookes forsake In which he hath his picture set. For when the course of time is past, And all our hopes fulfil'd shall be, Thou op'ning, must restore at last The limbes in shape, which now we see. Nor if long age with powerfull reigne, Shall turne the bones to scatter'd dust; And onely ashes shall retaine, In compasse of an handfull thrust: Nor if swift flouds, or strong command Of windes through emptie aire haue tost The members with the flying sand; Yet man is neuer fully lost. O God, while mortall bodies are Recall'd by thee, and form'd againe, What happie seat wilt thou prepare, Where spotlesse soules may safe remaine: In Abrahams bosome they shall lie Like Lazarus, whose flowry crowne The rich man doth farre off espie, While him sharpe fiery torments drowne. Thy words, O Sauiour, we respect, Whose triumph driues blacke death to losse, When in thy steps thou wouldst direct The Thiefe thy fellow on the Crosse. The faithfull see a shining way, Whose length to Paradise extends, This can them to those trees conuay, Lost by the Serpents cunning ends. To Thee I pray, most certaine Guide: O let this soule which thee obay'd, In her faire birth-place pure abide, From which she, banisht, long hath stray'd. While we vpon the couer'd bones Sweet Violets and leaues will throw: The title and the cold hard stones, Shall with our liquid odours flow, CHAP. VI. Of the care and cost anciently vsed in the preseruing whole and entire the bodies of the dead. Strange wayes, customes, and fashions of buriall. AS in former times the most of all Nations were ardently desirous of decent buriall; so Histories doe shew that the Ancients, and namely the Egyptians, were no lesse carefull, and curious to preserue whole and entire, the bodies of the dead laid within their Sepulchres, and to keepe them from putrifaction, so much as they could possible, which they did by this meanes. So soone as any one amongst them (especially of exemplary note) was dead, they would draw out the braines of the defunct, at the no¦strils, with an instrument of iron, replenishing the same with preseruatiue spices; then cutting vp the belly with an Aethiopian stone, called Laigne, and extracting the bowels, they cleansed the inside with wine, and stuffing the same with a composition of Cassia, myrrhe, and other odours, closed it againe. The like the poorer sort of people effected with Bitumen (as the in∣side of their skuls and bellies yet testifie, saith Sandvs, lib. 2 who saw such their strange embalmed bodies) fetcht from the lake of Asphaltis in Iury. So did they by the iuyce of Cedars, which by the extreame bitternesse and si catiue qualitie, not onely subdued (forthwith) the cause of interiour cor∣ruption, but hath to this day (a continuance of aboue three thousand yeares) preserued them vncorrupted. Within their bellies (besides their odorous compositions) they enclosed certaine painted papers; and strange shapes of their Gods, in little models of stone or mettall: this done, they wrapt the bodie with linen in multitudes of folds, besmeared with gumme in manner of a seare-cloth, swathled with bands of the same; staining their breasts with Hierogliphycall characters; and so laid them downe in such vaults, as did belong to euery mans particular familie. Camerar, Lib. 1. cap. 25. in his Hist. Meditations, saith, That the Ancients fixed nailes of brasse; within their dead bodies knowing well that brasse is a mettal very solid and lasting, in which qualitie both Horace and Virgil do commend it: that it keepeth a long time from rust and corruption, and that it is endued with a particular vertue against putrifaction. And not long since (saith he) there was found in a certaine wood neare to Nuremburgh very ancient Tombes, and amongst the bones of the dead, nailes and buckles of brasse. It is reported by Fulgosus, and other forraigne Authours, as also by our owne countrey-men, William of Malmesbury, and Matthew of Westmin∣ster; that in the yeare of Grace, one thousand thirty and seuen, the bodie of Pallas, the sonne of Euander, slaine by Turnus in single combat, was found, and taken vp in Rome, intire and sound in all parts, to the great asto∣nishment of the beholders, in that it had triumphed so many ages ouer all corruption. At his head was found The like found at the suppression of Abbaies in . a burning lampe, which could not bee extinguisht, neither by violence of blast, nor by aspersion of liquor. Vpon whose tombe this Epitaph following was then found. Filius Euandri Pallas, quem laurea Turni Militis occidit; more suo iacet hic. Pallas Euanders sonne, by Turnus speare In combate slaine; on this wise lieth here. Within the Parish of Stepney in Midlesex, in Radcliffe field, where they take ballast for ships; about some fourteene or fifteene yeares agoe, there was found two Monuments, the one of stone, wherein was the bones of a man, the other a chest of lead, the vpper part being garnished with Scallop shels, and a crotister border. At the head of the coffin, and the foot, there were two Iars, of a three foot length, standing, and on the sides a number of bottles of glistering red earth, some painted, and many great viols of glasse, some sixe, some eight square; hauing a whitish liquour within them With∣in the chest was the body of a woman, as the Chirurgians iudged by the skull. On either side of her, there was two scepters of Iuory, eighteene inches long, and on her breast a little figure of Cupid neatly cut in white stone. And amongst the bones two printed peeces of Iett, with round heads, in forme of nailes three inches long. It seemeth (saith Sir Robert Cotton, from whom I had this relation) these bodies were burned about the yeare of our Lord 239. being, there were ound diuers coines of Pupienus, Gordian, and the Emperours of that time. And that one may coniecture by her ornaments, that this last body should be some Princes or Propretors wife here in Britaine, in the time of the Ro∣mane gouernment. In the North isle of the Parish-church of Newport painell in Bucking∣hamshire, in the yeare 1619. was found the body of a man whole and per∣fect; laid downe, or rather leaning downe, North, and South▪ all the con∣cauous parts of his body, and the hollownesse of euery bone, as well ribs as other, were filled vp with sollid lead. The skull with the lead in it doth weigh thirty pounds and sixe ounces, which with the neck-bone, and some other bones (in like manner full of lead) are reserued, and kept in a little chest in the said Church, neare to the place where the corps were found; there to bee showne to strangers as reliques of admiration. The rest of all the parts of his body are taken away by Gentlemen neare dwellers, or such as take delight in rare Antiquities. This I saw. Thus you see by the premises, how magnificent our Ancients were in the ordering and expenses of Funerals; how sumptuous in their houses of death or sepulchres; and how carefull to preserue their dead carcases from putrifaction; for so much as the soule, saith Sandys, knowing it selfe by di∣uine instinct immortall, doth desire that the body (her beloued companion) might enioy (as farre forth as may be) the like felicity, giuing, by erecting lofty Monuments, and these dues of Funerall, all possible eternitie. But now iudicious Reader vnderstand, that howsoeuer I haue spoken, or whatsoeuer I shall speake hereafter of buriall, and the ceremonies thereun∣to belonging: De . Des. cap. 11. yet I speake now out of Saint Augustine and Ludouicus Vtues his Commentor, that it is not preiudiciall to a Christian soule to bee forbid∣den buriall. For although the Psalmist complaines (as I haue said before) how that none would bury the dead bodies of Gods seruants; yet this was spoken to intimate their villany which did it; rather then their misery which suffered it. For though that vnto the eyes of man, these acts seeme bloudy and tyrannous, yet precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints. And our faith, holding fast the promise, is not so fraile, as to thinke that the rauenous beasts can depriue the body of any part to bee wanting in the resurrection; where not a haire of the head shall be missing; a new restitution of our whole bodies being promised to all of vs in a mo∣ment, not onely out of the earth alone, but euen out of the most secret an∣gles of all the other elements, wherein any body is or can bee possibly in∣cluded. A bad death neuer followes a good life, for there is nothing that maketh death bad, but that estate which followeth death. What power then hath the horrour of any kinde of death, or the want of buriall, to af∣fright their soules that haue led a vertuous life? Quo loco, quo modo, quo tempore, fiat haec emigratio, quid interest? vndique Christi fidelibus d coe∣lestia regna patet aditus. The familie of the gorgeous rich glutton, prepared him a sumptuous fu∣nerall vnto the eyes of men, but one farre more sumptuous, did the mini∣string Angels prepare for the vlcered begger, in the sight of God. They bare him not into any Sepulchre of marble, but placed him in the bosome of Abraham. Lucans Pharsalia, the ninth booke, speaking of great Pompey, who wan¦ted a Tombe, tells vs how that his spirit ascended vp to the heauens; to which habitation few come that are entombd in rich and sumptuous mo∣numents, thus. The eternall Spheres his glorious spirit doth hold; To which come few, with incense buri'd, tomb'd in gold. And the said Lucan in his seuenth booke, speaking of the dead, that Caesar forbad should be burned, or buried, after hee hath brought forth many graue sentences concerning this matter of buriall, at length thus concludes, speaking as it were passionately vnto Caesar. This anger bootes thee not; for tis all one Whether the fire, or putrefaction Dissolue them; all to Natures bosome go, And to themselues their ends the bodies owe. If now these Nations, Caesar, be not burnd, They shall, when earth and seas to flames are turnd; One fire shall burne the world, and with the skie Shall mixe these bones: where ere thy soule shall be, Their soules shall goe; in aire thou shalt not flie Higher, nor better in Auernus lie. Death frees from fortune: Earth receiues againe What euer she brought forth: and they obtaine Heauens couerture, that haue no vrnes at all▪ Ae . l. So Virgil who appoints a place of punishment in hell for the vnburied, yet in Anchises his words, he shewes how small the losse of a graue is. But to conclude with mine Authour Saint Augustine. If the necessaries of mans life, as meate, and cloathing, though they be wanting in great ex∣tremitie, yet cannot subuert the good mans patience, nor draw him from goodnesse; how much lesse power shall those things haue, which are omit∣ted in the burying of the dead, to afflict the soules that are already at quiet in the secret receptacles of the righteous. And whereas in the bloudy ouer∣throw of many fierce battels; in the sacking and subuersion of many Townes and Cities, the bodies of the Christians haue wanted the rites and ceremonies of buriall; it was neither fault in the liuing that could not per∣forme them, nor hurt to the dead that could not feele them. Yet notwith∣standing all this which I haue spoken, the bodies of the dead are not to be contemned, and cast away, especially of the righteous and faithfull, which the holy Ghost hath vsed as Organs, and instruments vnto all good works; for if the garment or ring of ones father, be so much the more esteemed of his posterity, by how much they held him dearer in their affection; then are not our bodies to bee despised, being wee weare them more neare vnto our selues, then any attire whatsoeuer. CHAP. VII. Of Cenotaphs, Honorarie and religious. Of the reuerence at∣tributed to these emptie Monuments. A Cenotaph is an emptie Funerall Monument or Tombe, erected for the honour of the dead, wherein neither the corps, nor reliques of any de∣funct, are deposited, in imitation of which our Hearses here in England are set vp in Churches, during the continuance of a yeare, or for the space of certaine moneths. Octauia the sister of Augustus, buried her sonne, young Marcellus, that should haue beene heire in the Empire, with sixe hundred Cenotaphs or hearses: and gaue to Virgil more then fiue thousand French crownes, in reward; for the writing of sixe and twentie Hexameters in her sonnes com∣mendation: all which you may haue for nothing, in the latter end of the sixth booke of his Aeneidos. These Cenotaphs were of two sorts: they were made either to the me∣mory of such as were buried in some other remote funerall monument; or to such which had no buriall at all: The first kinde of these Cenotaphs are called by Suetonius in the life of Claudius, Honorarie tombes; erected Ho∣noris vel memoriae gratia. Such as the souldiers made to the memorie of Drusus, neare vpon the riuer of Rhine, howsoeuer his body was carried to Rome, and there interred in Campo Martio. Alexander Seuerus (slaine by the treacherie of certaine seditious French souldiers, about the yeare of grace 238) An Emperour (saith Sir Thomas Eliot, who translated his story out of Greeke) whose death all Rome la∣mented, all good men bewailed, Some say hee was slaine here in England, some others in the Citie of Mentz in Ger∣many. all the world repented, whom the Senate deified, noble fame renowned, all wise men honoured, noble writers com∣mended) had his Cenotaph erected in France neare vnto the place where he was slaine; but his body was carried to Rome, and there interred vnder a most rich magnificent sepulchre, as Lampridius affirmes. Septimius Seuerus the Romane Emperour died in Yorke, in the yeare of mans saluation 212. out of which Citie his corps were carried forth to the funerall fire, by the sixth Legion of his souldiers, called Victrix; after the militarie fashion, Camd. in York. committed to the flames, and honoured with iusts and Turneaments, in a place neare beneath the Citie Westward, where is to be seene a great mount of earth raised vp as for his Cenotaph. But his ashes, being bestowed in a little golden pot, or vessell of the Porpherite-stone, were carried to Rome, and shrined there in the Monument of the An∣tonines. Constantine, or Constantius, the younger sonne to Constantine the Great, who is supposed to be the builder of Silcester in Hampshire, died at Mops∣uestia in Cilicia, Camd. in Hamp. and was interred in Constantinople in the Sepulchre of his Ancestours. Yet he had a Cenotaph, or emptie monument, built to his memory, in the said now-ruined Citie of Silcester. And many there were that, in honour and remembrance of them, had such monuments built, about which the souldiers were wont yearely to iust, and keepe solemne Turneaments in honour of the dead. The second kinde of Cenotaphs were made Religionis causa, to the me∣mory of such whose carcases, or dispersed reliques, were in no wise to bee found, for example, of such as perished by shipwracke, of such as were slaine, cut, mangled, and hew'd apeeces in battell, or of such that died in forraine nations; whose burials were vnknowne. For in ancient times it was thought, that the Ghost of the defunct could not rest in any place quietly, before the body had decent buriall, or the performance thereof, in as am∣ple manner as could possibly be imagined. Aeneas (as it is fained) by the helpe of Sibylla Cumea, descending into hell, found Palinurus his shipmaster (drownd not long before) among many more wandring about the lake of Styx, Vir. Aen. l. 6. because his body was vnbu∣ried: which kinde of punishment is thus related by the Prophetesse; Phaers translation. This prease that here thou seest beene people dead, not laid in graue, A pitious rable poore that no reliefe nor comfort haue: This Boate-man Charon is. And those whom now this water beares, Are bodies put in ground, with worship due of weeping teares. Nor from these fearfull bankes, nor riuers hoarce they passage get: Till vnder earth in graues their bodies bones at rest are set. An hundred yeares they walke, and round about these shores they houe, And then at last (full glad) to further pooles they do remoue. Then after this she puts him in comfort with hope of Exequies and hono∣rable buriall, thus. Since whan, O Palinure, both all this madnesse come on thee? Wouldst thou the Limbo-lake, and dolefull flouds vntombed see? Vnbidden from this banke doest thou indeed to scape intend? Seeke neuer Gods eternall doome, with speech to thinke to bend. Yet take with thee Aeneas word, and comfort thus thy fall, For they that border next vnto that mount, and Cities all, By t kens great from heauen shall be compelld thy bones to take, And tombe they shall thee build, and solemne seruice shall thee make. And Palinurus name for euermore the place shall keepe. This spoken, from his heauy heart his cares abating creepe, And sorrowes partly shranke; and glad on earth his name he knew. Vlysses at the commandement of Circes went downe into the lower shades, where he met with his companion, or fellow-traueller Elpenor, who desired of him buriall, H . yss. . ij. with the ceremonies thereof; as also a Sepulchre, which Vlysses granted and erected to his memory a Cenotaph. Doe not depart from hence, and leaue me thus Vnmournd, vnburied; lest neglected I Bring on thy selfe th▪incensed Deitie. I know, that sai d from hence, thy ship must touch On th'Isle Aeaea, where vouchsafe thus much, (Good King) that landed, thou wilt instantly, Bestow on me thy royall memory. And on the foamie shore a Sepulchre Erect to me, that after times may heare Of one so haplesse. Let me these implore; And fixe vpon my Sepulchre the Ore, With which aliue I shooke the aged Seas, And had of friends the deare societies. To these inania busta, or vacua Sepulchra, the friends of the defunct would yearely repaire, and there offer sacrifice, vpon Altars erected neare to the Cenotaph for that purpose, calling vpon the spirit, ghost, or Manes of him, to whose memory the Cenotaph was made, by which ceremony they imagined, that the body of the party deceased, would lie some where or other at re , and his ghost would giue ouer walking, as though all the dues of funerall had beene really performed to him at his death: Parental. in praef. as in Au∣sonius. Voce ciere animas, funeris instar habet. And aga ne. Ille etiam moesti cui defuit vrna sepulchri, Nomine ter dicto paene sepultus erit. Aeneas saluted the soule of Deiphobus, the sonne of old Priam, at his Ce∣notaph after the same manner. —The rumour went, Virgil. l. 6. Aen. How in the night extreme of Greekish slaughters wearie spent; Thou headlong threw'st thy selfe on mixed heape of enemies slaine: Then I my selfe to thee, an emptie Tombe on Rheta plaine Aduancing vp did build, and thrice thy soule saluted cleere; Thy name, and armes that place preserues, but thee O friend so deare, Could I not see, that in thy countrey-ground I might interre. Then Deiphobus said, Nothing sweet friend can I require; All duties done thou hast, nor more my ghost can thee desire. You haue the manner of sacrificing about these Cenotaphs expressed in Virgil, lib. 3. Aen. where Andromache celebrates the Anniuersary of her slaine husband arme-puissant Hector, thus. Great sacrifice by chance that time, and gifts with heauie minde Before the Towne in greenwood shade, by Simois water side, Andromache to Hectors dust with seruice did prouide; And dainties great of meat she brought, and on his soule she cride At Hectors Tombe; that greene with grasse, and turfs stood her beside. And causes more to mourne, thereby two Altars had she set. The solemnitie of Polydores obit at his emptie hearse; is described in the said booke much what after the same manner: Anon therefore to Polydore an Hearse we gan prepare, And huge in height his Tombe we reare; all Altars hanged are, With weeds of mourning hewes, and cypres trees, and blacke deuise: And Troian wiues with haire disclosde, as is their guise. Great fomy boules of milke we threw luke-warme on him to fall, And holy bloud in basons brought we poure, and last of all We shrikt, and on his soule our last, with great outcries we call. And much what to the same purpose are these verses in Ouids Metam. lib. 6. fab. 7. Progne, her royall ornaments reiects, And puts on blacke: an emptie Tombe erects To her imagin'd ghost: oblations burnes: Her sisters fate, not as she should, she mournes. To the memory of the Grecians slaine in the warres of Troy, Pausa. in Corin∣thiacis. a Cenotaph was set vp at Corinth. In the expedition of Cyrus, Xenophon lib. 6. an emptie sepulchre was built for the slaine and mangled souldiers, whose reliques could not be found. The Romanes, Tacit. li, Annal. cap. 23. sixe yeares after the slaughter made by Arminius of so many of their Legions; erected a Cenotaph, or couered with earth the re∣maines of their friends and kindred, howsoeuer it was vncertaine whether they buried the stranger or friend. And Caesar to shew a gratefull memory of the dead, and himselfe to be partaker of their griefe, with his owne hands put the first turfe on their Tombes. The Primitiue Christians did exhibite a religious honour to the Ceno∣taphs of holy men (to whose memory many in those dayes were erected) which for the profession of the Gospell had suffered martyrdome, or vnder∣gone those variety of torments, which were as then inflicted vpon the faith∣full: as you may reade in Theodoret. lib. de Martyr. and in these Saphicks of Aurelius Prudentius. Per Stephanon. Hy nus 4. Nonne, Vincenti, peregre necatus Martyr, his terris tenui notasti Sanguinis rore speciem futuri morte propinqua? Hoc colunt ciues velut ipsa membra Cespes includat suus, & paterno Seruet amplectens tumulo beati Martyris ossa. It was, and is the vse in most countries, to inscribe these emptie monu∣ments, as reall sepulchres, with the names and titles of the defunct, to whose honour they were intended. As in Ouid. Meta, lib. 11. fab. 10. Seas fright me with their tragicall aspect, Of late I saw them on the shore eiect Their scattered wracks, and often I haue read Sad names on Sepulchres that want their dead. And a little after in the same fable, where Alcyone mournes for her drownd husband Ceix, thus. —would I with thee Had put to sea: a happie fate for me; Then both together all the time assignd For life had liu'd; nor in our death disioynd Now here, I perisht there: on that profound, Poore I was wrackt; yet thou without me drownd. O I, then flouds more cruell, should I striue To lengthen life, and such a griefe suruiue; Nor will I, nor forsake thee, nor deferre. Though one vrne hold not both, one Sepulchre Shall ioyne our titles: though thy bones from mine The seas disseuer, yet our names shall ioyne. Death choakt the rest. — Our Ancients accustomed likewise to garnish, decke, and adorne these cenotaphs, as other tombes or sepulchres; and that with all kinde of reue∣rence: and whosoeuer did deface, or breake downe, any of these Honorarie void Monuments, exemplarie punishment was inflicted vpon the partie so offending, as vpon your Tumboruchoi or graue-diggers. But I will con∣clude this chapter with this difference of Sepulchres and Cenotaphs; as I finde it recorded by Scipio Gentilis, Sepulchrorum sanctitas, saith he, in ipso solo est, quod nulla vi moueri neque deleri potest. Cenotaphiorum vero in ipsa religione & reuerentia viuorum, quae & mutari & deleri potest. CHAP. VIII. Of the sanctity ascribed sometimes to ancient Funerall monuments; and of the ardent desire most men haue, and euer had, to visit the Tombes and Sepulchres of eminent worthy persons. FVnerall Monuments (especially of the godly and religious) haue euer beene accounted sacred. Batti veteris sacrum Sepulchrum. The sacred Sepulchre Of old Bat, loe is here. saith Catullus. To which effect, Quintilian, Declam. 10. Sacratos morte lapides, etiam ossa & cineres, & ossa religiosè quiescentia fracta sparsisset vrna. And they were accounted the more sacred, by how much they were of more conti∣nuance. Sepulchra sanctiora sunt vetustate, saith Vlpian. And as in the Se pulchres themselues, there was euer holden to bee a kinde of sancti ie; so there was holden to bee the like or more holinesse in the soile whereupon these sepulchres were made and erected. And such a holinesse, as I haue said before, quod nulla vi moueri neque deleri potest; and more especially in that ground, wherein the bodies of Christians were interred, by reason of the sanctified corps that it receiued. It is an vse in some parts of Ireland (as yet not altogether abolished) for children to sweare by their forefathers hand, or by their Lords hand. And in the countrey where I was borne, the vulgar sort especially, doe most commonly sweare by the crosse of their owne Parish Kirke, as they call it, and in ancient times children vsed to sweare, by the Sepulchres of their pa∣rents. Others by the sepulchres of such persons, who in their life time were reputed honourable amongst them, either in regard of the worthinesse of their person, or of the eminence of place of gouernment which they held in the weale publike. And by these oathes (the things themselues being reue∣rently esteemed, and accounted sacred) their assertions or asseuerations were alwayes holden the better to be beleeued. I reade in the Sto ehouse of Times, lib. 8. cap. 12. Part. 1. that a Master bearing his Slaue neere to the Temple of Apollo ; the Slaue fled from him, and knowing that the Tem∣ple afforded refuge, ranne thereinto, and mounting vp to the Altar embra∣ced the image His Lord pursued him, and hauing forcibly recouered him from the Statue without any reuerence of the place, began againe to giue him many Bastonadoes. The seruant fled from him once more, and ranne to saue himselfe at the Tombe of his Lords deceased Father: but then, in meere paternall dutie, he left punishing him any more, and pardoned him the fault which hee had committed. In such reuerend and religious regard the very Pagans had the Tombes of their Ancestours. But, with vs, in these dayes, I see no such reuerence that sonnes haue to their fathers hands, or to their Sepulchres. I heare no swearing by Kirkes, Crosses, or Sepulchres. I heare sometimes, I must confesse, for swearing to build Churches; swearing to pull downe crosses, and to deface or quite demolish all Funerall Monuments; swearing and protesting that all these are remaines of Antichrist, papisticall and damnable. Now to come to the other part of this Chapter. All men in generall are taken with an earnest desire to see ancient great Cities; yea and the very tract where such cities were in former times scituated, howsoeuer they bee destroyed, laid leuell with the ground, and their very ruines altogether rui∣ned: I will instance with the glory of Asia, Troy Ouid. Met. l. 15. So rich, so powerfull, that so proudly stood, That could for ten yeares space spare so much bloud, Now prostrate, onely her old ruines showes, And Tombes that famous Ancestours enclose. Now although these ruines, and ruined Tombes, are at this day no more but coniecturally extant: as Sandys writes, who viewed the circuit of ground whereupon it once stood. And that Iam seges est vbi Troia fuit. Corne now growes where Troy once stood. Yet like him we daily know many Trauellers sailing neare thereunto, to be desirous to see those celebrated fields, that affoorded to rarest wits so plen∣tifull an argument. And so we reade how that in former times, many tooke the like paines to behold this Citie so renowned throughout the whole Vniuerse. For ex∣ample, the great Alexander. Earths fatall mischiefe, and a cloud of thunder Rending the world, a starr that strucke asunder The Nations. as Lucan calls him: hauing read many heroicall actions performed at the besieging of this Citie, made it in his Iourny to see it; and finding it laid desert, caused it to be reedified; gaue great immunities and priuiledges to the inhabitants, whom hee exempted from ordinarie Tributes, and institu∣ted their Free-martes, or Markets, for al such as would dwell there, or ne∣gotiate with them. Ouid. l. 25. That blasing Comet, Iulius Caesar, who darted his raies ouer so many regions. Who did the habitable earth command, And stretcht his Empire ouer sea and land. goes in person to behold that farre-famed Citie; where treading vpon He∣ctors graue-stone, hid with rubish, and growne ouer with grasse, hee is found fault withall by a Phrygian, thus. Respect you not great Hectors Tombe, quoth he, but for all this reprehension Lucn . l. 9. Sack'd Troyes yet honour'd name he goes about, To finde th'old wall of great Apollo out. Now fruitlesse trees, old oakes with putrifi'd And rotten roots the Troian houses hide, And Temples of their Gods, all Troy's orespread With bushes thick, her ruines ruined He sees the bridall groue, &c. And being pleased with the sight of these Antiquities, he offers sacrifice to the ghost of Hector, and to the rest of those magesticke Heroes, or halfe-gods, there interred: promising withall (conditionally) to build vp anew this City of Troy. Then Caesar pleas'd with sight of these so prais'd Antiquities, a greene turffe altar rais'd, And by the Frankincense-fed fire prepar'd These orizons not vaine; you Gods that guard These Heroes dust, and in Troyes ruines reigne: Aeneas houshold gods, that still maintaine In Alba and Lauinia your shrines, Vpon whose altars fire yet Troian shines; Thou sacred Temple clos'd Palladium, That in the sight of man didst neuer come; The greatest heire of all Iulus race, Here in your former seat implores your grace, And pious vses on your altars layes; Prosper my course, and thankfull Rome shall raise Troyes walls againe; your people Ile restore, And build a Romane Troy. Marcus Aurelius, Dioclesian, and Claudius, Romane Emperours, po∣tent, and mightie, took paines to trauell from Rome to this City of Troy, onely to take suruay of what venerable antiquities were as then remaining; and to leaue memory to posterity of their being there, they caused a goodly columne of white marble to be therein erected, whereupon were engrauen these words following. Imperator. Caesar. Mar. Aur. Pius. Foelix. Parthicus Maximus, Trib. Pleb. Imp. P.X.V. Cons. III. Prouinciam Asiam, per viam, & flumina pontibus subiugauit. And on the other side of the said pillar was likewise engrauen, Imperator Caesar Augustus Dioclesiano. P. Cos. 11. regnante Tribunicia vicit potestate. M.F.T. & Claudius, C. VIII. P.R. But to come nearer home; who hath euer read or credibly heard of the magnificencie of that capacious City of Verulam (of which I haue spoken before) so much renowned for so many memorable exploits, but more espe∣cially for the inuincible constancie, and resolute suffering, of our Protomar∣tyr, Saint Alban, that would not desire to see the place where it sometimes stood? howsoeuer Of it there now remaines no memory, Spons. Ruines of Time. Nor any little monument to see, By which the Traueller, that fares that way, This once was she, may warned be to say. Who would not see, if hee could with conueniencie, the scituation of Silcester in Hampshire, hauing read in our ancient Historiographers, how famous it was in the time of Constantius the sonne of great Constantine, and how that our first Christian worthy, king Arthur, was there inuested with the royall Diadem? howsoeuer, no markes are at this day remaining to shew that euer it was a Citie; saue a wall of two miles in compasse, contai∣ning within fourescore Acres of ground, diuided into certaine cornfields. The seeing of places, wee know to haue beene frequented or inhabited by men, whose memory is esteemed, or mentioned in stories, doth moue and stirre vs vp as much, or more, then the hearing of their noble deeds, or reading of their compositions▪ With the like desire (or more then they haue to see these old Cities en∣tombed in their owne ruines) many men take paines with farre trauell, to view strange cities, famous and flourishing in their owne countrey, or in for∣raine Nations. What stranger, or home-bred countrey-man, would not ardently long to see our rich, powerfull, and imperiall Citie of London; when hee reades or heares how spatious, how populous, how plenteous, and how faire builded it is? And who would not couet to see Paris, hearing that it is the capitall Citie of France; and as some will haue it, of all Europe, farre greater fairer built, and better scituate then London. And who would not visit Rome, if abilities of bodie and meanes were all-sufficient, his occasions would permit, and that with safety hee might; it being a citie, Laudandis pretiosior ruinis: Euen made more honourable By ruines memorable. Moun. Cap. . As Mountaigne writes, and as I my selfe, being there, did also obserue; A Citie whose ruine is glorious with renowne, and swolne with glory; for low-leuelled as she lieth, and euen in the Tombe of her glory, yet for all this she reserueth the liuely image and regardfull markes of Empire. And, aboue the rest, who would not ardently desire to see Ierusalem that holy Citie with the sepulchre, hauing heard or read the sacred Scriptures; or such historicall Authours as haue written of the same? Considering then that the most of men do earnestly desire, Vlysses like Qui mores hominum multorum vidit, & vrbes. to see ancient great cities (obseruing euer their gouernment, with the man∣ners of the Inhabitants) either flourishing, quite fallen downe, or partly ruined; So all men (a snifling conuenticle or companie of proud Sectaries excepted) are as greedily affected to view the sacred Sepulchres of worthie, famous personages, yea and the very places, where such haue beene inter∣red, although no Funerall Monument at all bee there remaining, to conti∣nue their memories: This desire made Alexander the great, in his Asian expedition, go to visit the Tombe of Achilles, which he couered with flowres, and ranne na∣ked about it (as then the custome was in funeralls) sacrificing to the ghost of his kinsman, whom he reputed most happy, that had such a Trumpet as Homer to resound his vertues; and weeping ouer the Tombe, complained that he was not so fortunate, as to haue a man that could so well publish his praises, as Homer had done those of Achilles. The sight of all the far-fam'd Antiquities of Egypt did not so much de∣ ght Caesar, as the sight of the Tombe of Alexander. Caesar in Aegypt fearelesse walkes and sees Lucan in the Argu∣ment . Their Temples, Tombes, and fam'd Antiquitie▪ afterwards in the booke,— he goes from thence To Alexandria, crown'd with confidence. —then goes he The stately Temple of th'old God to see; Which speakes the ancient Macedonian greatness But there delighted with no obiects sweetnesse, Not with their gold, nor Gods maiesticke dresse Nor loftie Citie walls; with greedinesse Into the burying vault goes Caesar downe▪ There Macedonian Philips mad-braind sonne The prosperous Thiefe, lyes buried▪ whom iust Slew in the worlds reuenge Augustus his successour, Emperour of Rome, went with the like desire, or more, to see the said Tombe of Alexander ; And not contented with the bare sight of the Sepulchre, Corpus Alexandri inspexit, idque attrectauit ita vt nasi quoque (ita enim fertur) particulam aliquam fregerit: he would needs looke into the Tombe and behold the body of the worlds terrour, Alexander, which hee so feelingly handled, that hee broke a little part of Alexanders Nose: as it is reported. But to come to our selues; What concourse of people come daily, to view the liuely Statues and stately Monuments in Westminster Abbey wherein the sacred ashes of so many of the Lords anointed, beside other great Potentates are entombed. A sight which brings delight and admira∣tion, and strikes a religious apprehension into the mindes of the beholders. We desire likewise to behold the mournfull ruines of other religions houses, although their goodly faire structures bee altogether destroyed, their tombes battered downe, and the bodies of their dead cast out of their coffins; for that, that very earth which did sometimes couer the corps of the defunct, puts vs in minde of our mortalitie, and consequently brings vs to vnfained repentance. What numbers of Citizens and others at this very time, go to Lesnes Abbey in Kent, to see some few coffins there lately found in her ruines, wherein are the remaines of such as haue beene there anciently interred; of which, when I come to speake of her Foundation. Neither can we passe by, but with yearning hearts looke vpon that fat∣ned soile (the fertile seed-plot of the Church) which in former times hath beene sprinkled with the bloud, blackt with the cinders, and strawne with the ashes, of those blessed Saints, who for the profession of the Gospell, by sword, fire, and fagot, haue suffered most cruell martyrdome: giuing reue¦rence and honour to their memories, because by their sufferings true Reli∣gion was propagated, and all idolatrie demolished: which we may lawful∣ly do, as vnto Gods chiefe champions standing vnto death for the truth. And as vnto men whom God hath aduanced into the society of his Angels in heauen; giuing also thanks, at these Martyrs and Saints solemne feasts, to God for their victories, endeauouring the attainment of such crownes and glories as they haue already attained; with other religious performances due vnto them▪ as ornaments of their memories. Prouided alwayes that we do not intermi e out deuotions with superstitious adoration. CHAP. IX. Of the punishments both by humane Iawes, and Gods seuere iustice, flicted vpon such malefactors in foregoing ages, who vio∣lated Sepulchers▪ Of Church-robbers. THose in foregoing ages) which did violate, misuse, or distaine tombes, graues, sepulchers, or any of these funerall Monuments, were punished richer with death, perpetuall exile, condemnation to the mines, banishment for a time, payment of money, forfeiture of goods, losse of members, or the like according to the qualitie of the person, and circumstance of the fact. To begin with the Clergie▪ Priest found guiltie of this execrable act (being so much more odious, by how much his place was reputed more honourable and religious) was degraded from his Priesthood, his goods set to open sale, and forfeited, and himselfe condemned to perpetuall banishment. If a man of eminent place, of great riches, ranke, and qualitie, did with an aimed hand, despoile any Tombe or Sepulchre, Latronis more, after the manner of an high-way robber, that man by the Law was put to executi∣on; if vnaimed, then the Iudge did send him to the Mines, or to banish∣ment, or punish him with some pecuniarie mu ct, to the value, most com∣monly, of halfe his goods, and branded him with eternall infamie. If a Seruant, or a man of meane fortunes, was knowne to pull downe, or deface any funerall Monument, without his masters priuitie, hee was con∣demned to the Mines; if hee had beene vrged thereunto by his master, then he was adiudged for a time to be banished; if he did digge vp, and draw out of the graue, the body or bones of the defunct, then his iudgement was death. If any man did deface, or cut away any part of the Effigies or representa∣tion of the defunct, caru'd, engrauen, or embost, vpon any graue-stone, tombe, or sepulchre, that man by the law was to lose his hand. Whosoeuer in the repairing of any ruinous decayed Sepulchre, did any way vndecently touch the body of the dead person, therein laid downe to his eternall rest▪ that party so offending, was commanded by the Law, De∣ em pondo auri Fisco inferre, to bring ten pound weight of gold into the xchequer: But the most execrable and hellish abuse of all other offered to the dead, is effected by witchcraft, incantation, and Art-magicke; an art, saith Quin∣ l a s, Declam. 15. which is said to disquiet the Gods, to trouble and dis∣place the starres, to search into the graues and sepulchres of the dead, to mutilate, dismember, and cut off, certaine parts of the carcases therein in∣humed, and by those pairings and cuttings, together with certaine horrid enchantments, charmes, and spels, to bring to passe strange, diabolicall conclusions. The powerfull force of which coniurers, witches, or infernall Hags is thus exprest by the ancient Poets.

But not to speake thus in generall of their power, and come nearer to the purpose: Sextus the sonne of great Pompey, desirous to know the euent of the Pharsalian warres, consults thereof with the witch Erictho, who, amongst many her powerfull charmes, resolues to take vp the body of one lately buried, which she, by her Art-magicke, would coniure to disclose the sad issue of his and his fathers fates: as it is thus in the Argument of the said sixth booke. To the dire witch Erictho, Sextus goes. This fatall warres sad issue to disclose: She quickens a dead carcase, which relates To Sextus eare, his and his Fathers Fates, And crauing then deaths freedome to obtaine, Is by a magicke spell dissolu'd againe. Now, in the booke following, Lucan makes young Sextus thus to woe, and sollicite the old witch Erictho, for the speedie knowledge of the warres euent. —thus Pompey's fearefull sonne best a e Wisest of all Thessalians, that canst make Foreknowne all things to come, and turne a ay The course of destiny, to me (I pray) The certaine end of this warres chance relate. am o meane part of the Romane state: Great Pompey's sonne, now either Lord of all, r wofull heire of his great funerall.

The witch makes a replication, with an expression, as also a limitation, of her magicke power, in these words. The mpious witch proud of a fame so spread Replies, young man, wouldst thou haue altered Some me ner fate, it had been easily done; could haue forc d to any action unwilling Gods, I can preserue the breath Of him whom all the starres haue doomb'd to death: And though the planets all conspire to make Him old, the midst of his lifes course can breake.

When all mankinde depend on one successe, If there you would change ought, our arts confesse ortune has greater power▪ but if content o be alone to know this warres euent, Many, and easie wayes for vs there be To finde out truth, the earth, the sea, the sky, T e dead, the Rodopeian rock, and fields Shall speake . But since late slaughter yeeld Such choice of carcases in Thessaly vp one of those who easiest be: That a warme new-slaine carcase with a cleare elligible voice may greet your eare▪ (by the sunne the organs parch'd and spill d) The dismall ghost vncertaine hissings yeild. rictho hauing raised vp a dead carcase, by her damnable incantations; and possest his inward parts with some diabolicall spirit, who by and thorow gans might giue to her and young Sextus some satisfactory answers, she goes forward with her demands. Speake (quoth Erictho ) what I aske, and well Shalt thou rewarded be: if truth thou tell, our Hamonian art Ile set thee free Throughout all ages, and bestow on thee Such funeralls, with charmes so burne thy bones, Thy ghost shall heare no incantations. Let this the fruit of thy reuiuall be, No spels, no herbs shall dare to take from thee Thy long safe rest, when I haue made thee die, The Gods, and Prophets answer doubtfully; But he, that dares enquire of ghosts beneath, And boldly go to th'oracles of death, Is plainly told the truth; spare not, but name Plainly the things, and places all, and frame A speech, wherein I may conferre with fate▪ Adding a charme to make him know the state Of whatsoe're she askt; thus presently The weeping carcase spake. The deuill in his conference with the Sompner (who to tell you by the way, —Is a renner vp and doun The de ion of a Sompner, Chaucer in the riei Pro∣logue. With maundements, fornicatioun And is y beat at euery tounes end) Amongst other his subtilties relates this for one; by way of interrogation, thus. Yet tell me (quoth this Sompner) faithfully, Chaucer in the Friers tale. Make ye you new bodies thus alway Of elements? the fiend answerd nay: Sometime we faine, and sometime we arise With dead bodies, and that in sundry wise, And speake as renably, faire and well As the Phitonesse did to Samuel. This violation or fearefull disturbance of the dead, was punished with ex¦treme tortures, and afterwards by decollation. Kelley (otherwise called Talbot ) that famous English Alchymist of our times, who flying out of his owne countrey (after he had lost both his cares at Lancaster) was entertained with Rodolph the second, and last of that Christian name, Emperour of Germany: for whom Elizabeth of famous memory, sent (very secretly) Captaine Peter Gwinne, with some others, to perswade him to returne backe to his owne natiue home; which hee was willing to doe: and thinking to escape away in the night, by stealth, as he was clammering ouer a wall in his owne house in Prague (which beares his name to this day, and which sometime was an old Sanctuary) he fell downe from the battlements, broke his legges, and bruised his body; of which hurts within a while after he departed this world. Sed quorsum haec, you will say: then thus, This diabolicall questioning of the dead, for the knowledge of future accidents, was put in practise by the foresaid Kelley ; who, vpon a certaine night, in the Parke of Walton in le dale, in the county of Lancaster, with one Paul Waring (his fellow com∣panion in such deeds of darknesse) inuocated some one of the infernall regi∣ment, to know certaine passages in the life, as also what might bee knowne by the deuils foresight, of the manner and time of the death of a noble young Gentleman, as then in his wardship. The blacke ceremonies of that night being ended, Kelley demanded of one of the Gentlemans seruants, what corse was the last buried in Law-church-yard, a Church thereunto adioyning, who told him of a poore man that was buried there but the same day. Hee and the said Waring intreated this foresaid seruant, to go with them to the graue of the man so lately interred, which hee did; and withall did helpe them to digge up the carcase of the poore caitiffe, whom by their incantations, they made him (or rather some euill spirit through his Or∣gans) to speake, who deliuered strange predictions concerning the said Gentleman. I was told thus much by the said Seruingman, a secondarie actor in that dismall abhorrid businesse: and diuers gentlemen, and others, are now liuing in Lancashire to whom he hath related this story. And the Gentleman himselfe (whose memorie I am bound to honour) told me a little before his death, of this coniuration by Kelley ; as he had it by relation from his said Seruant and Tenant; onely some circumstances excepted, which he thought not fitting to come to his masters knowledge. These iniuries done against the dead, who ought to sleepe in peace vntill the last sound of the Trumpet, haue euer beene, euen amongst the very Pa∣gans themselues, esteemed execrable. Insomuch that if any man that was knowne to haue committed such an hainous offence, and did by chance escape the hand of humane Iustice, yet he could not (in their opinion) auoid the punishment of the diuine powers. Whereupon they vsed to make their imprecations to Isis, or some other of their gods or goddesses; against such as should any wayes violate and breake downe their Sepulchres or eternall houses of rest. As in this old Inscription. Secus qui fecerit; mitem Isidem iratam sentiat, & suorum Ossa eruta, atque dispersa videat. We reade in holy Writ that the king of the Moabites was so sauagely cruell, euen after death, against the king of Edom; that he tooke his body out of the Sepulchre, and burnt his bones into lime; for which barbarous rage, vpon the sacred remaines of a kings body, hee and his people were punished of God: these are the words of the Prophet. Amos Thus saith the Lord, for three transgressions of Moab, and for foure, I will not turne to it, because it burnt the bones of the king of Edom into lime. Therefore will I send a fire vpon Moab, and it shall deuoure the palaces of Kerioth, and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of a Trumpet. And I will cut off the Iudges out of the midst thereof, and will slay all the Princes thereof with him, saith the Lord. Amongst the Christians, adeo flagitiosum hoc scelus habitum fuit, vt atiam inter causas relatum sit, sur vxor à marito diuortere posset, si nimirum Sepulchrorum dissolutorem esse probauerit: saith Kirkman, De funeribus Rom. l. 3. cap. 26. out of Theodosius and Valent. Emperours, Cod. de repudijs. Remaines. And of this barbarous kinde of cruelty against the dead, Camden in his Remaines giues you these words following, out of Nouel. Leg. Valent. Aug. de Sepulchris, Tit. V. Nimis barbara est, & vesana crudelitas, munus extre∣mum luce carentibus inuidere, & dirutis per inexpiabile crimen Sepulchris, monstrare coelo eorum reliquias humatorum. And the heathens (saith he) did account and verily beleeue, that those qui in patrios cineres minxissent; hoc est, qui patrium Monumenta violassent : which had pist vpon their fathers ashes, that is to say, those which had violated the Monuments of their An∣cestours, elders, or forefathers, to be no otherwise then Patricides or mur∣therers of their fathers or deare friends; and that such should be strucke to death by lightning from heauen; & after death that they should be fright∣ned, tost vp and downe, and tormented in hell, with burning torches by the hands of the furies; whereupon Horace de Arte Poetica versus finem. Nec satis apparet cur versus factitet, vtrum Minxerit in patrios cineres; an triste bidental Mouerit incestus. In Cimbrike Chersonese ; a Distich, vpon one of the funerall Monu∣ments of the familie of the Ranzouies, giues this admonishment to the way-faring man. Ad Viatorem. Si pia maiorum violas monumenta, viator; Vltrices Furias experiere breui. As it was holden vnlawfull and punishable, in former times, for any one to pisse, in or against the walls of any religious structure (a custome (to our shame) too commonly vsed of vs in these dayes, of which I shall haue often occasion to speake hereafter) so, you may thinke, that it was holden to bee an impious and hainous offence for any one, to pollute with vrine, the tombes, or graues of their parents, predecessours, friends, or any other who∣soeuer. Which to preuent, they were wont to make a deprecation, or ear¦nest sute, in some part of their funerall Inscriptions, on this manner. Hospes ad hunc tumulum ne meias, Ossa precantur tecta hominis. For indeed such as had their graues, tombes, statues, or representations, thus stained and defiled, were thought to haue passed out of this world with shame and ignominie. I cannot without griefe remember (saith Camden ) how barbarously and vnchristian like some not long since haue offended by the abusing of these Monuments; Remaines. yea some mingendo in patrios cineres ; which yet wee haue seene strangely reuenged. Now as the violation of Sepulchres, so the depredation of Churches, Church-robbing, or Sacriledge, was in all ages accounted most damnable. De Ecclesia qui aliquid furatur, Aug. super Ioha. Iudae proditori comparatur : He that steales any thing from the Church, may be compared to Iudas the traitour. Ali∣quid inde subtrahere, Hieron. Ep. 34. omnium praedonum cupiditatem superat ; to hooke or draw any thing from thence, is a sinne, which exceeds the most detestable desire of all other sorts of robbers. Sacrum sacro qui dempserit, Cicero de Legi∣bus. rapueritque Parricida esto : He that abates, or forcibly takes way that which is sacred, or given to any sacred vse, let him be reputed, and thought of, as wee doe of a murtherer of his owne parents. Against Church-spoilers, and breakers of Church-liberties, Ann. 1257. 3. Maij, Boniface Archbishop of Canterbury, assisted with other Bishops, apparelled in their Pontificals, with Tapers burning, denounced the sen tence of Excommunication, in this forme. Rastat. Excommenge∣ment. By the authoritie of Almighty God, the Father, the Sonne, and the ho∣ly Ghost, and of the glorious mother of God, and perpetuall Virgin Mary, of the blessed Apostles, Peter and Paul, and of all Apostles, and of all Mar∣tyrs, of blessed Edward king of England, and of all the Saints of heauen; we excommunicate, accurse, and from the benefits of our holy mother the Church, we sequester all those, that hereafter willingly, and maliciously, de∣praue or spoile the Church of her right. And all those that by any cra t, or wilinesse, do violate, breake, diminish, or change the Church liberties and free customes, contained in the Charters of the common liberties, &c. But I speake here of such sacrilegious persons as do rob, and bereaue the Church of her treasure and sacred ornaments; a sinne of such, onely, which do misprise, and contemne Religion: a sinne which hath beene by the very Pagans obserued neuer to escape vnpunished.

Quintus Cepio with his company hauing taken and spoiled the Towne or Citie of Tholouse in France, entred forcibly into the holy Temples, out of which sacrilegiously hee tooke to the quantitie of one hundred and ten thousand markes in gold, and fiue hundred millions of marks in siluer; but euery man of them, which were guilty of that robbery, with all their kin∣dred and families died within that yeare; and not aboue one of them, did carry so much as one piece thereof home to his owne house. This treasure of Tholouse was a part of the Delphian riches. For Brennus (the brother of Belinus king of great Britaine) Captaine of the Gaules brake open the Tem∣ple of Apollo at Delphos, for the riches and the gold therein, which had beene offered to the Gods, which hee committed to publike spoile. The most part whereof was conuaid by the Tectosages (a people of the West part of Narbon) to this city of Tholouse; Iustin. Hist. l. 32. but presently vpon this sacri∣ledge and contempt of the Gods; . the most of his armie (which consisted of one hundred and fifty thousand footmen, and fifteene thousand horse∣men) were discomfited and slaine; and hee so furiously possessed, that hee slue himselfe with his owne hands. —quis enim laesos impune putaret Esse deos! For who could thinke the Gods thus wronged Their punishment would be prolonged. Virgil makes these Church-robbers, these contemners of Religion, to bee more miserably, then others, tormented in hell. —Phlegyas miserrimus omnes Admonet, & magna testatur voce per vmbras, Discite iustitiam moniti, & non temnere Diuos. — Phlegyas most of misers all, Amongst those caytiues darke and loud with voice to them doth rore, Learne Iustice now by this, and Gods aboue despise no more. This Phlegyas king of the Lapithes (a people dwelling in a part of Thes∣salie) hauing done infinite dammages in Greece, surprizing many Townes and Cities: became in the end so ouer▪ weening, and foolish bold, that hee sacked the foresaid Temple of Apollo in Delphos, and slue Philamon, that cunning Harper, the sonne of Apollo, who brought an armed power to re∣scue his fathers oracle. Vpon which sacriledge and contempt of the gods, all the countrey of the Phlegyans was vtterly ruinated with an earthquake, and flaming arrowes shot from heauen, which killed most of the people, and the few that remained died of the plague; and for this high handed of∣fence, their foresaid king is still plagued in hell. Which verses of Virgil, to that purpose, thus paraphrastically translated, will it please you to reade ouer againe: Phlegias king most wretched in that place; Forewarneth all of his great misery, And as sad witnesse of his pitious case, In those dimme shades he cries out wofully: Learne to doe Iustice: and by my contempt, Of the high Gods, do you like fate preuent. Histories affoard infinite examples of this kinde in all sorts of Religions▪ yea Christian kings, and other Potentates in all ages haue misprised the true, onely, all-sauing God, by the sacrilegious taking away of the rights, riches, and ornaments of holy Church; yet it hath beene obserued, that they seldome or neuer escaped scotfree as: the sequele of this worke will shew. Seuere punishments haue formerly beene inflicted vpon Church▪ rob∣bers of the meaner ranke, Stow. Annal. by the strictnesse of our Lawes here in England. For an instance, in the twentieth yeare of Edward the fourth, on the 22. day of February, fiue notable malefactors were put to death at Lon∣don, for robbing of Churches and other places; especially the collegiate Church of Saint Martins le grand in London; for the which three of them were drawne to the Tower-hill, and there hanged and burnt, the other two were pressed to death. Wee haue not heard of the hanging of any such Church robbers in these our dayes, for Sublata causa tollitur effectus ; the cause taken, or, if you will, stolne away, the effect will consequently cease: For what man will venture a turne at the Gallows, for a little small siluer chalice, a beaten-out pulpit cushion, an ore-worne Communion-cloth, and a course Surplisse? these are all the riches and ornaments of the most of our Churches; and these are more, by the Surplisse, then by some of the Parishioners may bee thought perhaps fitting to be allowed: such is now the sleight regard we haue of the decent setting forth of sacred Religion. Of which a late writer, Sacred Religion, Sam. Daniell Musophilus. mother of forme and feare, How gorgeously sometimes dost thou sit deckt? What pompous vestments do we make thee weare? What stately piles we prodigall erect? How sweet perfum'd thou art, how shining cleare? How solemnly obseru'd, with what respect? Another time all plaine, and quite threed-bare; Thou must haue all within, and nought without Sit poorely without light; disrobd, no care Of outward grace to amuze the poore deuout. Powerlesse, vnfollowed, scarcely men can spare Three necessarie rites to set thee out. Either truth, goodnesse, vertue, are not still The selfe same which they are; and alwayes one, But alter to the proiect of our will; Or we our actions make them wait vpon, Putting them in the liuery of our skill, And cast them off againe, when we haue done. CHAP. X. Of the rooting vp, taking away, erazing and defacing of Funerall Monuments in the reignes of King Henry the eighth, and Edward the sixth. Of the care Queene Elizabeth, of famous memory, had, for the preseruation of the same. Her Procla∣mation in the second of her raigne against defacing of Monuments. TOward the latter end of the raigne of Henry the eight, and throughout the whole raigne of Edward the sixth, Vid . Parl. An. 2 . d 6. ca. 6. and in the beginning of Queene Elizabeth, certaine persons of euery County were put in authority to pull downe, and cast out of all Churches, Roodes, grauen Images, Shrines with their reliques, to which the ignorant people came flocking in adoration. Or any thing else, which (punctually) tended to idolatrie and superstition. Vn∣der colour of this their Commission, and in their too forward zea e, they rooted vp, and ba tered downe, Crosses in Churches, and Church-yards, as also in other publike places, they defaced and brake downe the images of Kings, Princes, and noble estates; erected, set vp, or pourtraied, for the one∣ly memory of them to posterity, and not for any religious honour; they crackt a peeces the glasse-windowes wherein the effigies of our blessed Sa∣uiour hanging on the Crosse, or any one of his Saints was depictured; or otherwise turned vp their heeles into the place where their heads vsed to be fixt; as I haue seene in the windowes of some of our countrey Churches. They despoiled Churches of their copes, vestments, Amices, rich hang∣ings, and all other ornaments whereupon the story, or the pourtraiture, of Christ himselfe, or of any Saint or Martyr, was delineated, wrought, or embroidered; leauing Religion naked, bare, and vnclad; as Dionysius left Iupiter without a cloake, and Aesculapius without a beard. It will not seeme distastfull, I hope, to my Reader, nor impertinent to this purpose, if I shall relate the story. Dionysius a Tyrant of Sicilie, spoiled the Churches, and tooke away a cloake of gold from Iupiter, saying (scoffingly) a cloth-cloake was lighter for Summer and warmer for Winter; he tooke likewise away from Aescu∣lapius his golden beard, saying it was a saucie part for him to haue a long beard, and his father Apollo to haue none. But this his scoffing sacriledge was punished in his sonne Dionysius, who was enforced to flie out of his owne kingdome; to trudge vp and downe like a runneagate, and in the end to leade a priuate life at Corinth. Seldome saith one, the children of them prosper, that scorne the false Gods, and beleeue not in the true God. And how the posteritie of these Commissioners haue prospered vpon earth, or how punished after death, God knowes all, howsoeuer by men somewhat in their passages hath beene obserued. Camd. in uff For these hote-burning in zeale of∣ficers, got cloakes to hide their knauery, and beards to visard their hypo∣crisie, and thereby vnder a goodly pretence of reforming Religion, they preferred their priuate respects, and their owne enriching, before the ho∣nour of their Prince and countrey; yea and before the glory of God him∣selfe. But the foulest and most in humane action of those times, was the viola∣tion of Funerall Monuments. Marbles which couered the dead were dig∣ged vp, and put to other vses (as I haue partly touched before) Tombes hackt and hewne a peeces; Images or representations of the defunct, broken, erazed, cut, or dismembred, Inscriptions or Epitaphs, especially if they be∣gan with an orate pro anima, or concluded with cuius animae propitietur Deus. For greedinesse of the brasse, or for that they were thought to bee Antichristian, pulled out from the Sepulchres, and purloined; dead carca∣ses, for gaine of their stone or leaden coffins, cast out of their graues, not∣withstanding this request, cut or engrauen vpon them, propter misericor∣diam Iesu requiescant in pace. These Commissioners, these , these Tombe-breakers, these graue-diggers, made such deepe and diligent search into the bottome of ancient Sepulchres, in hope there to finde (belike) some long-hidden treasure; Ioseph. Antiq. Iud. l. 13. ca 5. hauing heard or read that Hircanus ex Dauidis Sepulchro tria millia auri talenta eruit: That Hircanus tooke three thou∣sand talents of gold out of King Dauids Sepulchre; Cod. Theod l 5 Crimen Sacrilegio proximum, a sinne the nearest vnto Sacriledge. Not so much for taking out the money, C ss d l. 4. for Aurum Sepulchris iustè detrahitur, vbi Dominus non ha∣betur, as for the drawing out, and dispersing abroad the bones, ashes, and other the sacred remaines of the dead. And hereupon the graue-takers, these gold-finders are called theeues, in old Inscriptions vpon Monuments. Plutoni sacrum munus ne attingite fures▪ And in another place: Abite hinc pessumi fures. But I haue gone further then my commission, thus then to returne. This barbarous rage against the dead (by the Commissioners, and others animated by their ill example) continued vntill the second yeare of the raigne of Queene Elizabeth, of famous memory, who, to restraine such a sauage cruelty, caused this Proclamation (following) to bee published throughout all her dominions; which after the imprinting thereof, shee signed (each one seuerally) with her owne hand-writing, as this was, which I had of my friend, Master Humphrey Dyson. ELIZABETH. A Proclamation against breaking or defacing of Monuments of An∣tiquitie, being set vp in Churches, or other publike places, for memory, and not for superstition. THe Queenes Maiestie vnderstanding, that by the meanes of sundrie people, partly ignorant, partly malicious, or couetous; there hath been of late yeares spoiled and broken certaine ancient Monuments, some of me∣tall, some of stone, which were erected vp aswell in Churches, as in other publike places within this Realme, onely to shew a memory to the poste∣rity of the persons there buried, or that had beene benefactors to the buil∣ding or dotations of the same Churches or publique places, and not to nourish any kinde of superstition. By which meanes, not onely the Chur∣ches, and places remaine at this present day spoiled, broken, and ruinated, to the offence of all noble and gentle hearts, and the extinguishing of the honourable and good memory of sundry vertuous and noble persons de∣ceased; but also the true vnderstanding of diuers Families in this Realme (who haue descended of the bloud of the same persons deceased) is thereby so darkened, as the true course of their inheritance may be hereafter inter∣rupted, contrary to Iustice, besides many other offences that doe hereof ensue to the slander of such as either gaue, or had charge in times past onely to deface Monuments of idolatry and false fained images in Churches and Abbeyes. And therefore, although it be very hard to recouer things bro∣ken and spoiled: yet both to prouide that no such barbarous disorder bee hereafter vsed, and to repaire as much of the said Monuments as conueni∣ently may be: Her Maiestie chargeth and commandeth all manner of per∣sons hereafter to forbeare the breaking or defacing of any parcell of any Monument, or Tombe, or Graue, or other Inscription and memory of any person deceased, being in any manner of place; or to breake any image of Kings, Princes, or nobles Estates of this Realme, or of any other that haue beene in times past erected and set vp, for the onely memory of them to their posterity in common Churches, and not for any religious honour; or to breake downe and deface any Image in glasse-windowes in any Church, without consent of the Ordinary: vpon paine that whosoeuer shal herein be found to offend, to be committed to the next Goale, and there to remaine without baile or mainprise, vnto the next comming of the Iustices, for the deliuery of the said Goale; and then to be further punished by fine or imprisonment (besides the restitution or reedification of the thing bro∣ken) as to the said Iustices shall seeme meete; vsing therein the aduise of the Ordinary, and if neede shall bee, the aduise also of her Maiesties Councell in her Starre-chamber. And for such as bee already spoiled in any Church, or Chappell, now standing: Her Maiestie chargeth and commandeth, all Archbishops, Bi∣shops, and other Ordinaries, or Ecclesiasticall persons, which haue autho∣ritie to visit the Churches or Chappels; to inquire by presentments of the Curates, Churchwardens, and certaine of the Parishoners, what manner of spoiles haue beene made, sithens the beginning of her Maiesties raigne of such Monuments; and by whom, and if the persons be liuing, how able they be to repaire and reedifie the same; and thereupon to conuent the same persons, and to enioyne them vnder paine of Excommunication, to repaire the same by a conuenient day, or otherwise, as the cause shall further re∣quire, to notifie the same to her Maiesties Councell in the Starre-chamber at Westminster. And if any such shall be found and conuicted thereof, no able to repaire the same; that then they bee enioyned to doe open pe ance two or three times in the Church, as to the qualitie of the crime and part belongeth vnder like paine of Excommunication. And if the partie that of∣fended bee dead, and the executours of the Will left, hauing sufficient in their hands vnadministred, and the offence notorious; The Ordinary of the place shall also enioyne them to repaire or reedifie the same, vpon like or any other conuenient paine, to bee deuised by the said Ordinary. And when the offendour cannot be presented, if it be in any Cathedrall or Col∣legiate Church, which hath any reuenue belonging to it, that is not parti∣cularly allotted to the sustentation of any person certaine, or otherwise, but that it may remaine in discretion of the gouernour thereof, to bestow the same vpon any other charitable deed, as mending of high-wayes, or such like; her Maiestie enioyneth and straightly chargeth the gouernours and companies of euery such Church, to employ such parcels of the said sums of any (as any wise may be spared) vpon the speedy repaire or reedification of money such Monuments so defaced or spoiled, as agreeable to the origi∣nall, as the same conueniently may be. And where the couetousnesse of certaine persons is such, that as Pa∣trons of Churches, or owners of the personages impropriated, or by some other colour or pretence, they do perswade with the Parson and Parishio∣ners to take or throw downe the Bels of Churches and Chappels, and the lead of the same, conuerting the same to their priuate gaine, and to the spoiles of the said places, and make such like alterations, as thereby they seeke a slanderous desolation of the places of prayer: Her Maiestie (to whom in the right of the Crowne by the ordinance of Almighty God▪ and by the Lawes of this Realme, the defence and protection of the Church this Realme belongeth) doth expresly forbid any manner of person, to ta e away any Bels or lead of any Church or Chappell, vnder paine of impri∣sonment during her Maiesties pleasure, and such further fine for the con∣tempt, as shall be thought meete. And her Maiestie chargeth all Bishops and Ordinaries to enquire of all such contempts done from the beginning of her Maiesties raigne, and to enioyne the persons offending to repaire the same within a conuenient time. And of their doings in this behalfe, to certifie her Maiesties priuie Coun∣cell, or the Councell in the Starre-chamber at Westminster, that order may be taken herein. Yeuen at Windsor the xix of September the second yeare of her Maiesties raigne. God saue the Queene. Imprinted at London in Pauls Churchyard by Richard Iugge and Iohn Cawood, Printers to the Queenes Maiestie. Cum priuilegio Regiae Maiestatis. This Proclamation was seconded by another, to the same purpose, in the fourteenth yeare of her Maiesties raigne, charging the Iustices of her Assise to prouide seuere remedie, both for the punishment and reformation thereof. But these Proclamations tooke small effect, for much what about this time, there sprung vp a contagious broode of Scismatickes; who, if they might haue had their wills, would not onely haue robbed our Churches of all their ornaments and riches, but also haue laid them l uell with the ground; choosing rather to exercise their deuotions, and publish their er∣ronious doctrines, in some emptie barne, in the woods, or common fields, then in these Churches, which they held to be polluted with the abhomi¦nations of the whore of Babylon. Besides about that time these foresaid wilfull Sectaries did penne, print, and spread abroad certaine seditious Pamphlets (as still they doe) against our booke of Common Prayer; against all Ecclesiasticall gouernment, and against all the rites and ceremonies vsed in this our orthodoxall Church of England; inuenting out of their owne corkie braines, a new certaine no∣ orme of Liturgie to themselues; thereby to bring into the Church all dis∣order and confusion. These Renegadoes are (at this day) diuided, and sub∣diuided into as many seuerall Sects, as there be seuerall Trades in the grea∣test Market-towne. As into Brownists, Barowists, Martinists, Prophesiers, Solifidians, Famelists, rigid Precisians, Disciplinarians, Iudaicall Thraskists, &c. and into a rable, numberlesse. of a booke in∣tituled, Con∣spiracie of pre∣tended Refor∣mation. In the three and thirtieth yeare of Queene Elizabeth, the sixteenth day of Iuly in the morning, Edmund Coppinger and Henry Arthington, repai∣red to one Walkers house neare vnto Broken warfe of London, where conferring with one of their Sect, named William Hacket of Own∣dale in the County of Northampton, Yeoman, they offered to anoint him king: But Hacket taking Coppinger by the hand, said, You shall not need, for I haue beene already anointed in heauen by the holy Ghost him∣selfe. Then Coppinger asked him what his pleasure was to be done: Go your way both (said he) and tell them in the citie, that Christ Iesus is come with his fanne in his hand to iudge the earth. And if any man aske you where he is, tell them he lies at Walkers house by Broken-wharfe; and if they will not beleeue it, let them come and kill me if they can: for as truely as Christ Iesus is in heauen, so truely is he come to iudge the world. Then Coppinger said it should be done forthwith: and thereupon went forward, and Ar∣thington followed, but ere he could get downe the staires, Coppinger ad begun below in the house, to proclaime newes from heauen of exceeding great mercy: that Christ Iesus was come, &c. with whom Arthi on also cried the same words aloude; following him along the streets from thence by Warling-street, and Old Change toward Cheape; they both ad∣ding beyond their commission, Repent England, repent. After they had both thus come (with a mightie concourse of common multitu e) with an vniforme cry into Cheape neare vnto the Grosse, and there finding the throng and prease of people to increase about them, in such sort a they could not well passe further, nor be conueniently heard of them all as they desired: they got them vp into an emptie pease cart; wherein they stood not onely vpon the words of their former crie, but reading something out of a paper, they went more particularly ouer the office and ca ling of Hac∣ket, how he represented Christ, by partaking a part of his glorified bodie, by his principall spirit, and by the office of seuering the good from the bad. And that they were two Prophets, the one of mercy, the other of iudge∣ment, called and sent of God, to assist this their Christ Hacket in his great worke. These men were apprehended the same day. The 26, of Iuly Hacket was arraigned, and found guiltie, as to haue spoken diuers most false and traiterous words against her Maiestie; to haue razed and defaced her Armes, as also her picture, thrusting an iron instrument into that part which did represent the breast and heart. For the which he had iudgement, and on the 28. of Iuly, hee was brought from Newgate, to a gibbet by the Cro e in Cheape; where being moued to aske God and the Queene forgiuenesse, be fell to railing and cursing of the Queene, and began a most biasphemous prayer against the diuine Maiestie of God. They had much ado to get him vp the ladder; where hee was hanged, and after bowelled and quartered. His execrable speeches and demeanure as well at his arraignment, as death, vtterly distained and blemished all his former seeming sanctitie, wherewith he had shroudly possessed the common people. Thus you see how easily ignorant people are seduced by false new doctrines, how suddenly they ll from true Religion into heresie, frensie, and blasphemie; robbing the Church of all her due rites, and (as much as in them lies) God of his Glory; which abuse, of these times, I leaue to be reformed by our reuerend Clergie. On the next day (to make an end of the Story) Edmund Coppinger ha¦uing wilfully abstained from meat, and otherwise tormented himselfe, died in Bridewell. And Henry Arthington lying in the Counter in Wood∣street, submitting himselfe, writ a booke of repentance, and was deliuered; such was the end of these men (saith mine Authour) of whom the il ie people had receiued a very reuerend opinion, both for their sincere holi∣nesse and sound doctrine. And in the yeare 1612. Aprill 11. Edward Wightman, another peruerse heretique, was burned at Lichfield. This Wightman would faine haue made the people beleeue, that he himselfe was the holy Ghost, and immortall, with sundrie other most damnable opinions, not fit to bee mentioned amongst Christians. Yet for all this, this heretique had his followers. It is much to be wished that all backsliders from our Church, should be well looked vnto at the first: and not to runne on in their puritanicall opinions. Of the Shcismatiques of those times, and more especially of Martin Marprelate, these Rythmicall numbers following were composed. Hic racet vt pinus, Nec Caesar, nec Ninus, Nec Petrus, nec Linus, Nec Coelestinus, Nec magnus Godwinus, Nec plus, nec minus, Quam Clandestinus, Miser ille Martinus; Videte singuli, O vos Martinistae, Et vos Brownistae, Et vos Barowistae, Et vos Atheistae, Et Anabaptistae, Et vos Haketistae, Et Wiggintonistae, Et omnes Sectistae, Quorum dux fuit iste, Lugete singuli, At Gens Anglorum, Presertim verorum, Nec non qui morum, Estis honorum, Inimici horum, Vt est decorum, Per omne forum In secula seculorum, Gaudete singuli. A certaine Northern Rimer also made these following Couplets vpon him and his seditious Pamphlets: The Welchman is hanged, Who at our Kirke flanged, And at her state banged, And brened are his buks. And tho he be hanged; Yet he is not wranged, The de'ul has him fanged Is his kruked kluks. His name was Iohn Penry a Welshman, a penner and a publisher of books, intituled, Martin marre Prelate, he was apprehended at Stepney, by the Vi∣car there, and committed to prison, and in the moneth of May 1593. hee was arraigned at the Kings bench in Westminster, condemned of Felonie, and afterward suddenly in an afternoone conuaied from the Gaile of the Kings Bench to Saint Thomas Waterings, and there hanged with a small audience of beholders, saith Stow. CHAP. XI. Of the conuersion of this our Nation from Paganisme to Christianity, including generally the Foundations of religious houses in the same; and the pietie in the Primitiue times; both of religious and Lay persons. OF the conuersion of this our Island, from Paganisme to Christianity, diuers authenticall Authors, both ancient and moderne, haue written at large: a little then of so much will suffice for this present Discourse. Christiana doctrina sexaginta octo plus minus annorum spacio, N Harp i ld. Angl Eccl. cap 1. secul. post pas∣sionem Domini nostri Iesu Christi, totum fere orbem peruagata est ; within the space of threescore and eight yeares, or thereabouts, after the death and passion of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ, Christian Religion was spread almost ouer the face of the whole world. And so fruitfull and famous was this spreading of the Gospell, that Baptista Mantuan, a Christian Poet, compares the increase thereof with that of Noah, thus alledging vnto it. Sicutaquis quondam Noe sua misit in orbem Pignora sedatis, vt Gens humana per omnes Debita caelituum Patri daret orgia terras; Sic sua cum vellet Deus alta in regna reuerti, Discipulos quosdam transmisit ad vltima mundi, Littora, docturos Gentes, quo numina ritu Sint oranda, quibus caelum placabile Sacris. As Noah sent from the Arke his sonnes, to teach The Lawes of God vnto the world aright; So Christ his Seruants sent abroad to preach The word of life, and Gospell to each wight; No place lay shadowed from that glorious Light. The farthest Isles, and Earths remotest bounds. Embrac'd their Faith, and ioy'd at their sweet sounds. Now to speake of the conuersion of this Island out of a namelesse Au∣thour, A Manus pt in the Ea le of Excesters le∣mino s Li∣brary. who writes a booke De regnis & Gentibus ad Christi sidem conuersis, thus: Prima Prouinciarum omnium (sicut antiquissimi Historiarum Scripto∣res memoriae prodidere, quorum etiam authoritatem M. A. Sabellicus inter nostrae aetatis recentiores est sequutus) Britannia Insula, publico consensu, Christi fidem accepit. The first of all Prouinces or farre countries (as ancient Historiographers haue deliuered to memory; whose authority M. A. Sabellicus, one amongst the late writers of our age, doth principally follow) this Island of Britaine, by common consent, receiued the Christian faith. The glorious Gospell of Iesus Christ (saith Gildas Albanius, Gild. de extud. Brit. surnamed the wise, the most ancient of our British Historians) which first appeared to the world in the later time of Tyberius Caesar, did euen then spread his bright beames vpon this frozen Island of Britaine. And it is generally receiued for a truth, that Ioseph of Arimathea (who buried the body of our Sauiour Christ) laid the founda∣tion of our faith in the West parts of this kingdome, at the place, or little Island, as then called Aualon, now Glastenbury; where he with twelue dis∣ciples his assistants, preached the Gospell of life vnto the Islanders, and found meanes there to build a Church or Oratorie of wreathen wands, as also a little cell thereunto adioyning; and this was the first religious house dedicated to the seruice of the true God in all Britaine: and these religious men the first beginners or founders of that famous fenny-seated Monastery, which is partly standing at this day, of which more hereafter, when I come to speake of the religious Foundations in Somersetshire. In the meane while will you reade what our countreyman Iohn Capgraue (in his Catalogue of English Saints) writes of Iosephs comming into this kingdome. Thus in English. Ioseph with his sonne Iosephes (saith he) and ten more of his assistants, sent hither by Philip the Apostle out of France, for the inhabitants salua∣tion, preached zealously, and without feare, the true and liuely faith; Ar∣uiragus as then swaying the Scepter of this land. The which Aruiragus, howsoeuer he was vnwilling at the first, to giue them entertainment, or to heare them preach any doctrine repugnant to the traditions of his prede∣cessours, yet because they came from such a farre remote countrey as the holy Land, and that he saw their ciuill behauiour, their sanctitie, and strict course in the manner of their life and conuersation, he gaue them a certaine Island to inhabite, in the West part of his dominions, all compassed about with lakes and standing waters, called Ynswitrim, or the glassie Isle; of which (saith he) a certaine Metrician made this Tetrastich. Intrat Analoniam duodena caterua virorum, Flos Arimathie Ioseph est primus eorum. Iosephes ex Ioseph genitus patrem comitatur, Hijs alijsque decemius Glasconie propriatur. George Owen Harry, in his Pedigrees, vpon report from others, saith, Ioseph brought ouer with him his sister Eurgaine, who afterwards married a Britaine, whose name was Starklos. Iohn Harding, in his Chronicle of England, will haue fourteene to ac∣company Ioseph in this iourney, and that amongst many Britaines conuer∣ted by them to the Christian faith; Aruiragus the king was one, to whom Ioseph gaue a shield of the Armes, which now we call S. George his Armes; such are the rimes in the English of those dayes, two hundred yeares since or thereabouts. Cap. 47. & 48. — Ioseph full holy and full wyse Of Arymathie wyth his felowes fourtene, Into this lond then came and gaue contene In Bretayne then this Ioseph dyd conuerte Brytons, as how to know the incarnacyon, Afore that Paynyms, and also peruerte He taught them of his conuersacyon, Of his passyon, and his resurrectyon. Wyth other thynges as the Chronycler sayth, That apperteyneth to Christes fayth. Ioseph conuerted king Aruiragus By hys prechyng, to knowe the lawe deuyne, And baptyzed hym as written hath Nennius The Cronycler in Bretayn tongue full syne. And to Chryst lawe made hym enclyne. And gaue hym a sheld of siluer whyte, A crosse endlong, and ouertwhart full perfyte. These Armes were vsed throughout all Bretayn For a common sygne eche manne to know his nacyon From enemyes, whiche now we call certayn, Saint Georges Armes by Nenius enformacyon. And thus these Armes by Iosephs creacyon, Full long afore Saint George was generate Were worshcipt here of mykell elder date. The seeds of true Religion thus sowne by the said Ioseph and his asso∣ciates; neare or vpon (for about this accompt there is some difference amongst writers) the yeare of our Sauiour Christ one hundred and foure∣score, Lucius (surnamed Leuer Maur, Non Bana. hist sua genti . which signifies great brightnesse) king of the Britaines; vpon his request made to Eloutherius Bishop of Rome (for as then, and many yeares after, the title of Pope was altogether vn∣knowne) two learned Diuines were sent vnto him from the said Bishop, at whose hands he receiued the lauer of baptisme. And so it sell out (our Histo∣ries say) that not onely his wife and family accompanied him in that hap∣pie course, Godwin de on. Brita. but Nobles also and Commons, Priests and people, high and low, euen all the people within his Territories. And that generally all their Idols were then defaced; the Temples of them conuerted into Churches, for the seruice of God, the liuings of their idolatrous Priests appointed for the maintenance of the Priests of the Gospell: and that instead of 25. Fla∣mines or high Priests of their idols, there were ordained 25 Bishops, as also for three Archflamines, three Archbishops, whereof one was seated at London, another at Yorke, and a third at Caerlion vpon the riuer Vske in Wales. Of all which will it please you peruse a few lines penned by my foresaid Author, Iohn Harding.

The foundation of the famous Colledge of Bangor in Wales is ascri∣bed to this king Lucius ; in which so many hundreds of Monkes liued de∣uoutly, and religiously, by the labour of their owne hands, according to this peece of my foresaid Author.

From the time of king Lucius vntill the entrance of Austin the Monke, called the Englishmens Apostle, which was foure hundred and some few yeares, the Christan faith was alwayes both taught and embraced in this Island; notwithstanding the continuall persecutions of the Romanes, Huns, Picts, and Saxons, which last, made such desolation in the outward face of the Church, that they droue the Christian Bishops into the desarts of Corn∣wall and Wales; by whose labours the Gospell was plentifully propaga∣ted amongst those vast mountaines; and those parts aboue all other made glorious, by the multitudes of their holy Saints and learned Teachers. Of which a namelesse Author mentioned by Speed. Hist. cap 9. Sicut erat celebris cultu numeroque Deorum; Cum Iouis imperium staret, Britannica tellus; Sic vbi terrestres coelo descendit ad oras Expectata salus, patribus fuit inclyta sanctis. Qui Neptunicolum campos, & Canibrica rura Coryneasque casas loca desolata, colebant. As were the Britaines famous for their zeale To Gentile Gods, whiles such they did adore; So, when the Heau'ns to Earth did Truth reueale, Bless'd was that Land with Truth and Learning store. Whence British plaines and Cambrias desert ground, And Cornewalls crags, with glorious Saints abound. About the yeare six hundred, Christian Religion in this Island, being almost totally eclipsed by seuerall persecutions, Pope Gregory the first, be∣ing zealously moued for the reconuersion of this English Nation, sent hither Austin the Monke, with other his associates; to kindle anew the sparkes of Christianity, which were couered in the cinders of Pagans desolation. The story is frequent, and I shall often touch vpon it. Ethelbert being as then king of Kent, receiued holy Baptisme by the said Austin, being principally induced thereunto, by Berta his wife and Queene, a Christian, daughter to Chilperuk king of France. Christianity being thus receiued by him, the most potent king of the Saxons. Regis ad exemplum totus componitur orbis. The good example of the King His people all to Christ did bring. The succeeding Saxon kings followed his heauenly steps, endeauouring in all they might, to ouerthrow the Synagogue of Satan, by breaking downe the abhominable idols throughout the whole Island. Edwyne king of Nor∣thumberland; Carpenwald, king of the East-English; Sebert king of the East-Saxons, Kynigilds king of the West-Saxons, Peda king of the Merci∣ s: Eth ulphe king of the South-Saxons, in the space of not much aboue threescore yeares, after the conuersion of King Ethelbert, were conuerted God so wrought with them) from Paganisme and Idolatrie, vnto the be∣leefe and worship of our Lord Iesus Christ: and the Christian faith was publikely preached in all their dominions. These and other the Saxon kings for san t ty of life are ranked before all the Kings and Potentates of the world For such was their feruent zeale in Religion, that he thought him∣selfe most happie, who in pious acts, hard penance, wearie pilgrimages, and retired solitude, spent the various course of life, which moued many of them to exchange a pallace royall, and a Scepter imperiall, for a poore cell and a Mon h st fe; to forsake their owne kingdome, and to liue as pil∣grimes in a forraine countrey; to lose their owne lines in warlike opposi∣tion against Pagans and Infidels, thereby to liue in heauen amongst the no∣ble army of Martyrs; and lastly, it moued them and other great persona∣ge so o v ng their pious examples, to erect and amplie endow religious , as Churches, Chappels, Schooles, Colledges, and Monaste∣ e the preaching and further propagating of the Christian faith. As you may see in the sequell of these intended labours▪ Whose charters did end with an execrable curse to all those which by any manner of meanes should demolish or ouerthrow any of such their sacred structures, or infringe, alienate, or diminish any of their immunities, or yearely reue∣newes. Likewise fearefull comminations and excommunications were threatned and thundred out against those which should scorne, abuse, de∣ceiue, or craftily entrap any one, either of the secular, or Monasticall or∣ders; and a benediction diuulged, and granted to all those by whom they should bee honoured, reuerenced, rewarded, and haue their liuelihoods further enricht: concluding with a promise to defend these religious Vo∣taries from the persecution of all humane enemies; and to maintaine their li e ies, freedomes, and priuiledges from the vsurpation of any secular power. Their donations were sometime in meeter or rime, with the names of a number of witnesses, whereunto the signe of the crosse was euer added; the forme of which you may reade hereafter: but the most of these their important writings were in prose, and many of them wondrous short. For example, King Athelston giues a certaine plow-land and other profits to the Priest of the Church of high Bickington in Denshire, in these words which I had from my friend, Master Tristram Risdon that countrey man. Ich Athelston Konyng, Grome of hys home, Y if and grant to ye Prestes of thus chyrche, On Yok of my lond freliche to hold: wodd in My holt hous to build; bit gras for alle hys beastes, fewell for his fire. vewel for hys herth corn f swine and p gs. pannage For Sow and Puggis World out end. To the gouernment of these foresaid holy Fabricks, and their reuenues, such men were chosen as were the best learned, and most eminent for integritie of life. The Priests consecrated by the imposition of hands; and appointed to say prayers, administer the Sacraments, instruct the Christians which daily increased; and to execute all such offices as belonged to a sacred Bishop or venerable Pastour, were in such high and holy repute amongst the lay-people, as that when any of them were espied abroad, they would flocke presently about him, and with all reuerence humbly beseech his Benisons, either by signing them with the crosse, or in holy prayers for them. And further (saith Bede ) it was the manner in those primitiue times, Lib. 4 cap. 27. of the people of England, that when any of the Clergie, or any priest came to a village, they would all by and by, at his calling, come together, to heare the word, and willingly hearken to such things as were said, and more willingly fol∣low in workes, such things as they could heare and vnderstand. A wonder∣full order of pietie both in priest and people. Chaucer in the prologue, to his Canterbury Tales, giues vs the character of a religious and learned priest, who in his holy actions did imitate the ex∣ample of the Clergie of these times, whereof I haue spoken; but such were not to be had by the dozens in his dayes, as by his writings appeares. The Parsone. A good manne there was of religioun, And was a poore Parsone of a toun: But rich he he was of holy thought and werke He was eke a lerned manne and a clerke, That Christes Gospels truly would preach, His Parishens deuoutly would he teach. Benigne he was and wonder diligent, And in adversitie full patient. And soch one he was proued oft times. sithes, Full loth were him to curse for his tithes, But rather would he yeuen out of doubt, Vnto his poore Parishens all about, Both of his offring and of his substaunce, He couthe in little thing haue suffisaunce. Wide was his parish and houses fer asander, But he ne left neither for raine ne thonder, In sikenesse in mischiefe for to visite The ferdest in his Parish, moch or lite, Vpon his feete, and in his hand a stafe: This noble example to his shepe he yafe, That first he wrought, and afterward taught, Out of the Gospell he the words caught, And this figure he added eke thereto; That if gold rust what should iron do? For yef a priest be foule, on whom wee trust, No wonder is a ignorant. leude man to rust: And shame it is, if a priest take kepe, To see a shitten Shepherd, and a cleane shepe Well ought a priest, ensample for to yeue By his clennesse, how his shepe should liue. He set not his benefice to hire, And let his shepe acomber in the mire, And renne to London, to sainct Poules To seken him a Chauntrie for soules: Or with a brother hede to be withold: But kept at home and kept well his fold, So that the wolfe made him not miscary, He was a shepherd, and not a mercenary. And though he holy were, and vertuous, He was not to sinfull men despiteous, Ne of his speech daungerous ne digne, But in his reaching discrete and benigne, To drawne folke to heauen, with fairenesse, By good ensample, this was his besinesse. But if he were any persone obstinate, Whether he were of high or low estate, Him would he snibbe sharply for the nonis, A better priest I know no where non is. He wayted after no pompe ne reuerence, Ne maked him no spiced conscience; But Christes lore, and his Apostles twelue He taught, but first he folowed it him selue. Bed. l. 1. ca. 26. The Monasticall orders likewise in that age, serued God in continuall prayer, watching, and fasting, and preaching the word of life to as many as they could, despising the commodities of this world, as things none of theirs, taking of them whom they instructed, onely so much as might serue their necessities; liuing themselues according to that they taught to others, being euer ready to suffer, both troubles, yea and death it selfe, in defence of the truth that they taught. Bed. li. 3 ca. 26. And in another place, speaking of the religious and lay-people in the North countrey; They had no money (saith he) but cattell, for if they tooke any money of rich men, by and by they gaue it to poore people. Neither was it needfull that either money should be gathered, or houses prouided for the receiuing and entertainment of the worshipfull and wealthy, who neuer came then to Church, but onely to pray and heare the word of God. The King himselfe, when occasion serued to come thither, came accom∣panied onely with fiue or sixe persons, and after prayer ended, departed. But if by chance it fortuned, that any of the Nobilitie, or of the worshipfull, re∣freshed themselues in the Monasteries, they contented themselues with the religious mens fare and poore pittens, looking for no other cates aboue the ordinary and daily diet. For then those learned men and rulers of the Church, sought not to pamper the panch, but to saue the soule; not to please the world, but to serue God. Wherefore it came then to passe, that euen the habite of religious men was at that time had in great reuerence; so that where any of the Clergie or religious person came, he should bee ioyfully receiued of all men, like the seruant of God. Againe, if any were met going on iourney, they ranne vn∣to him, and making low obeysance, desired gladly to haue his benediction either by hand or by mouth. Also if it pleased them to make any exhorta∣tion as they passed by, euery man gladly and desirously hearkened vnto them. Vpon the Sondayes ordinarily the people flocked to the Church, or to Monasteries, not for belly-cheare, but to heare the word of God: And if any Priest came by chance abroad into the village, the inhabitants thereof would gather about him, and desire to haue some good lesson or collation made vnto them. For the Priests, and other of the Clergie in those dayes, vsed not to come abroad into villages, but onely to preach, to bap∣tise, to visit the sicke, or (to speake all in one word) for the cure of soules▪ Who also at that time were so farre from the infection of couetousnesse and ambition, that they would not take territories and possessions toward the building of Monasteries, and erecting of Churches, but through the earnest suite, and almost forced thereunto by noble and wealthy men of the world: which custome in all points hath remained a long time after (saith he) in the Clergie of Northumberland. No lesse feruent in deuotion, and austere in strictnesse of life, in these dayes, were the religious Votaries of the female sex. I had almost forgotten (saith Capgraue ) (in the prologue to his booke of the English Saints) the company of sacred virgines, which like lillies amongst thornes, despising all carnall pleasures, with all the great pompe and riches of the world (many of them being kings daughters) did in all chastitie, pouertie, and humilitie, adhere onely to their Sauiour Iesus Christ, their celestiall Bridegroome, for whose sake (as in this subsequent Treatise will be shewne) they did vndergo many exquisite torments, and in the end were glorified with a crowne of martyrdome. Deus ex sexu elegens infirmiore vt fortia mundi confunderent. In a Lieger booke belonging sometime to the Abbey of Rufford, Mss. in bib. Cotton. I finde these verses following of the constant sufferings of certaine virgine martyrs.

But I will conclude this Chapter with the words of Camden, speaking of the Monasticall life and profession. The profession of this Monasticall life (saith he) began when Pagan Ty∣rants enraged against Christians, pursued them with bloudy persecutions. For then good deuout men, that they might serue God in more safety and security, withdrew themselues into the vast wildernesses of Egypt, and not (as the Painims are wont with open mouth to giue it out) for to enwrap themselues willingly in more miseries because they would not be in miserie. Where they scattered themselues among mountaines and desarts, liuing in caues and little cells, here and there in holy meditations. At first solitary and alone: whereupon in Greeke they were called Monachi, that is, Monkes: but after they thought it better (as the sociable nature of mankinde requi∣red) to meete together at certaine times to serue God, and at length they began to cohabite and liue together for mutuall comfort, rather then like wilde beasts to walke vp and downe in the desarts. Their profession was to pray, and by the labour of their owne hands to get liuing for themselues, and maintenance for the poore, and withall they vowed pouerty, obedience, and chastitie. Athanasius first brought this kinde of Monkes, consisting of lay-men, into the West-Church. Whereunto after that Saint Austen in Afrike. Saint Martin in France, and Congell (one of the Colledge of Bangor) in Britaine and Ireland, had adioyned the function of regular Clergie. It is incredible how farre and wide they spread, how many and how great Coenobies were built for them, so called of their communion of life: as also Monasteries, for that they kept still a certaine shew of solitarie liuing: and in those dayes none were more sacred and holy then they, and accordingly they were reputed; considering how by their prayers to God, by their example, doctrine, labour, and industrie, they did exceeding much good, not onely to themselues, but also to all mankinde. But as the world grew worse and worse, so those their holy manners, as one said, rebus cesse∣re secundis, that is, Gaue backward in time of prosperitie. But of the pietie of religious professours in the Primitiue times, of the sanctitie of British and Saxon Kings, of their Queenes, and issue royall; as also of other persons of exemplarie zeale and holy conuersation; I doe speake hereafter in particular, as I come to the places of their interments. CHAP. XII. Of the fall or backsliding as well of religious persons, as of lay-people from the foresaid zealous ardour of pietie. THis heate of deuotion, which I haue spoken of, continued not long in this Island. For as the Clergie and other religious orders, grew rich in faire buildings, proud furniture, and ample reuenues, so they daily increa∣sed in all kindes of disorders; which was no sooner perceiued, but put in pra∣ctise by the Laitie: our kings declined from their former sanctitie, and (which the worst was) after their examples, many others (especially of the Nobilitie) did follow their licentious traces. Examples of Princes being al∣wayes of greater force then other lawes, to induce the people to good or to euill.

Malms de gestis oni. lib. 1. de Epis. Do∣rober. In the yeare of Grace, 747 Cuth∣bert Archbishop of Canterbury, by the counsell of Boniface Bishop of Mentz, called a Conuocation at Cliffe beside Rochester, to reforme the ma∣nifold enormities wherewith the Church of England at that time was ouergrowne. Our kings forsaking the companie of their owne wiues, in those dayes delighted altogether in harlots, which were for the most part Nunnes. The rest of the Nobilitie following their example, trode also the same trace. The Bishops likewise, and other of the Clergie, that should haue beene a meanes of the reforming these faults in others, were themselues no lesse faultie; spending their times either in contentions and brables, or else in luxurie and voluptuousnesse, hauing no care of study, and seldome or ne∣uer preaching Whereby it came to passe, that the whole land was ouer∣whelmed, with a most darke and palpable mist of ignorance, and polluted with all kinde of wickednesse and impietie, in all sorts of people. In which Conuocation, after long consultation with those his Bishops, or Suffra∣ganes, and the rest of the Clergie which were holden in greatest esteeme for their learning, in number thirtie, for the reformation of these horrible abuses, endeauouring thereby (like a good Pastour) to turne away the wrath of God which seemed to hang ouer this land, and to threaten those plagues which not long after fell vpon it, when the Danes inuaded the same. Edgar, surnamed the peaceable, King of England in the yeare, 969. called together his Bishops, and other of his Clergie, to whom hee made this or the like Oration, as followeth. Forsomuch as our Lord hath magnified his mercy to worke with vs it is meete (most reuerend Fathers) that with worthy workes we answer his innumerable benefits: Allernd. uall. a M ss in ib. Cot. Stow Annal. for neither by our owne sword possesse we the earth, and our owne armes hath not saued vs; but his right hand and his holy arme; for that he hath beene pleased with vs. Meete therefore it is, that we submit both our selues and our soules to him, that hath put all things vn∣der our feet; and that we diligently labour that they whom he hath made subiect vnto vs, may bee made subiect vnto his lawes. And truly it is my part to rule the Laitie, with the law of equitie, to doe iust iudgement be∣twixt man and his neighbours, to punish Church-robbers, to represse re∣bels, to deliuer the weake from the hands of his stronger; the poore and needie from them that spoile them. And it also belongeth to my care, to haue consideration to the health, quietnesse, or peace of the Ministers of the Church, the flocke of Monkes, the companies of Virgines, and to prouide the things needfull for them. The examining of whose manners belong∣eth vnto you, if they liue chastly, if they behaue themselues honestly to∣wards them which bee abroad, if in diuine seruice they bee carefull, if in teaching the people diligent, if in feeding sober, if moderate in apparell, if in iudgement they be discreet. If you had cured these things by prudent scru∣tinie (by your licence I speake O reuerend Fathers) such horrible and ab∣hominable things of the Clerkes had not come to our eares. I omit to speake, that their Crowne is not large, nor their rounding conuenient, but wantonnesse in apparell, insolencie in behauiour, filthinesse in words, doe bewray the madnesse of the inward man. Furthermore, how great negli∣gence is there in the Diuines, when in the holy Vigils, they will scarce vouchsafe to be present, when at the holy solemnities of the diuine-seruice, they seeme to bee gathered together to play and to laugh, rather then to sing. I will speake that which good men lament, and euill men laugh at. I will speake with sorrow (if so be it may be spoken) how they flow in banquet∣tings, in chambering and wantonnesse, that now Clerkes houses may bee thought to be brothell houses of harlots, and an assembly of plaiers. There is dice, there is dancing and singing, there is watching till midnight, with crying and shouting. Thus the patrimony of Kings, the almes of Princes, yea (and that more is) the price of that precious bloud is ouerthrowne. Had our fathers therefore for this purpose emptied their treasures? hath the Kings bountifulnesse giuen lands and possessions to Christian Churches for this end? that Clerkes harlots should be pampered with delicious dain∣ties, that riotous guests may be prepared for; that hounds and hawkes, and such like toyes may be gotten. Of this the Souldiers cry out, the common people murmure, the i sters and scoffers sing and dance, and you regard it not; you spare it, you dissemble it. Where is the sword of Leuy, and zeale of Simeon, which killed the circumcised Sichimites, being the figure of them that defile the Church of Christ, with polluted acts, abusing Iacobs daugh∣ter as an harlot? Where is the spirit of Moses, that spared not his hous∣hold, kinsfolke worshipping the head of the calfe? Where is the dagger of Phin es the Priest, who killing him that played the harlot with the Madia∣nite, with this holy emulation pacified Gods wrath? where is the spirit of Peter, by whose power couetousnesse is destroyed, and Simoniall heresie condemned? Endeauour to imitate, O ye Priests in God: It is time to rise against them that haue broken the Law of God. I haue Constantines, you haue Peters sword in your hands, let vs ioyne right hands, let vs couple sword to sword, that the Leapers may bee cast out of the Church, that the hallowed place of our Lord may bee purged, and the sonnes of Leui may minister in the Church. Go to carefully, I beseech you, lest it repent vs to haue done that which we haue done, and to haue giuen that which wee haue giuen, if we shall see that not to be spent in Gods seruice, but on the riotousnesse of most wicked men, though vnpunished libertie. Let the re∣liques of holy Saints, which they scorne, and the reuerend Altars before which they rage, moue you: Let the maruellous deuotion of our Ance∣stours moue you, whose almes the Clerkes furie abuseth, &c. To you I commit this businesse, that both by Bishoplie censure, and kingly authority, filthie liuers may be cast out of the Church, and they that liue in order may be brought in. Not long after, Hen. Hunting. li. 6. to wit, in the raigne of Etheldred, commonly called, The vnready, it was foretold by an holy Anchorite; that forsomuch as the peo∣ple of this Nation were giuen ouer to all drunkennesse, treason, and careles∣nesse of Gods house; first by Danes, then by Normans, and last of all by the Scots they should be ouercome.

Howa d. whilest he lay sicke of that sicknesse whereof he died, after he had remained for two dayes speechlesse, on the third day ly∣ing for a time in a slumber, or soft sleepe, at the time of his waking, he fetch∣ed a deepe sigh, and thus said. O Lord God Almightie, if this be not a vaine fantasticall illusion, but a true vision which I haue seene, grant me space to vtter the same vnto these that stand here present, or else not. And herewith hauing his speech perfect, he declared how he had seene two Monkes stand by him, as he thought, whom in his youth he knew in Normandie to haue liued godly, and died Christianly. These religious men (said he) protesting to me that they were the messengers of God, spake these words. Because the chiefe gouernours of England, the Bishops, and Abbots, are not the mini∣sters of God, but the deuils, the Almighty God hath deliuered this king∣dome for one yeare and a day into the hands of the enemy, and wicked spi∣rits shall walke abroad through the whole land. And when I made answer that I would declare these things to the people, and promised on their be∣halfe, that they should doe penance in following the example of the Nini∣uites: they said againe, that it would not be, for neither should the people repent, nor God take any pitie vpon them And when is there hope to haue an end of these miseries? said I: Then said they, when a greene tree is cut in sunder in the middle, and the part cut off, is carried three acres breadth from the stocke, and returning againe to the stoale, shall ioyne therewith, and be∣gin to bud and beare fruit after the former manner, by reason of the sap re∣newing the accustomed nourishment, then (wee say) may there bee hope that such euils shall cease and diminish. With these words of the dying king, though many that stood by were strucke with feare; yet Stig and the Church-chopper, Archbishop of Canterbury, made but a iest thereof, say∣ing, that the old man doted, and raued now in his sicknesse. Neuerthe∣lesse within the same yeare the truth of this propheticall dreame or vision did plainly appeare.

By which meanes there was scarce left any man in authoritie of the English nation to beare rule ouer the rest, insomuch that it was counted a reproach to be called an Englishman.

Nothing was now more in vse then seasing, farming, and merchandizing of Church-li∣uings, and the chiefe agent in this businesse was one Ranulf Flambard, the Kings Chaplaine, afterwards Bishop of Durham, for which he gaue a thou∣sand pounds. Robert Bluet gaue for the Bishopricke of Lincolne, fiue thou∣sand pounds: and one Herbert Prior of Fiscane in Normandy bought for his father, whose name was Losinge, the Abbacie of Winchester, and for himselfe the Bishopricke of Norwich.

Petre nimis tardas, nam Symon ad ardua tentat: Si praesens esses, non Symon ad alta volaret. Proh dolor Ecclesiae nummis venduntur & aere, Filius est Praesul pater Abbas Symon vterque. Quid non speremus si nummos possideamus? Omnia nummus habet, quid vult facit, addit, & aufert, Res nimis iniusta, nummis sit Praesul & Abba. Thus translated by Bale in his Votaries: A monster is vp the sonne of Losinga, Whiles the law seeketh Simony to flea: Peter thou sleepest, whiles Simon taketh time; If thou wert present, Simon should not clime. Churches are prised for syluer and gold, The sonne a Bishop, the father an Abbot old. What is not gotten if we haue richesse? Money obteineth, in euery businesse In Herberts way yet, it is a foule blot, That he by Simony, is Bishop and Abbot. But Simonie was not so common now as other sinnes; for the Clergie in generall gaue themselues strangely to worldly pleasures, Higd. in Polych. lib. 7. cap. 6. and pompous va∣nities; they wore gay rich garments, gilt spurres, embroidered girdles, and bushie locks. The Monkes of Canterbury, as well nigh all other Monkes in England, were not vnlike to secular men, Idem. lib▪ cod. . they vsed hawking and hunting, playing at dice, and great drinking; thou wouldest haue taken them to haue beene great Magnificoes rather then Monkes, they had so many seruants and at∣tendance of goodly aray and dignity. Anselme Archbishop of Canterbury, by the permission of King Henry the first, Mat. Paris. assembled a great Councell of the Clergie at Westminster; where∣in he depriued many great Prelates of their promotions for their seuerall offences, and many Abbots for other enormities; forbidding the farming out of Church dignities. In the raigne of King Henry the second, the abuses of Church-men were growne to a dangerous height, saith well the Monke of Newborough, lib. 2. cap. 16. for it was declared, saith he, in the Kings presence, that Clergie men had committed aboue an hundred murthers in his raigne: Of which nine yeares were, as then, scarcely expired. And in the 23 of his raigne, the Nunnes of Amesbury were thrust out of their house, because of their in∣continent liuing. Rog. Houed. Richard Cordelion, king of England, being told by a certaine Priest called Fulco, a Frenchman, that he kept with him three daughters, namely, pride, couetousnesse, and lechery, which would procure him the wrath of God, if he did not shortly rid himselfe of them: answered, That he would present∣ly bestow his three daughters in marriage; the Knights Templers (said he) shall haue my eldest daughter Pride: the white Monkes of the Cis ux order, Couetousnesse: and my third daughter Lechery, I commit to the Prelates of the Church, who therein take most pleasure and felicitie. And there you haue my daughters bestowed among you. In the raigne of Henry the third, the Templars in London being in great glory, entertained the Nobilitie, forraine Embassadours, and the Prince himselfe very often, insomuch that Matthew Paris, Monke of Saint Albans, who liued in those dayes, cried out vpon them for their pride, who being at the first so poore as they had but one horse to serue two of them (in token whereof they gaue in their seales two men vpon one horsebacke) yet suddenly they waxed so insolent, that they disdained other orders, and sorted themselues with Noblemen. But this their insulting pride had a quicke period: for shortly after, to wit, in the beginning of King Edward the seconds raigne, in the Councell at Vienna, this their so highly esteemed order, was, vpon cleare proofe of their generall, odious, abhominable sins, and incredible Atheisticall impieties by them practised, vtterly abolished throughout all Christendome: And by the consent of all Christian Kings, depo ed all in one day; taken all and committed to safe custody: And thus being polit kely apprehended, their lands and goods were seised vpon: the heires of the Donours here in England, and such as had endowed these Templars with lands, entred vpon those parts of their ancient patrimonies after this dissolution, Tho. de la and detained them vntill not long after they were by Parliament wholly transferred vnto the Knights of the Rhodes, or of S. Iohn of Ierusalem. A litt e before the vniuersall extinguishment of this order of the Tem∣plars, . M rtyr. pag 33 . Edit. Philip the French King caused 54. of that Order with their great Master to be burnt at Paris; for their hainous vngodlinesse. In the raigne of Edward the third, the Clergie of England exceeded all other Nations in the heaping vp together of many Benefices, and other spi∣rituall promotions; besides, at that time, they held the principall places both of trust and command in the kingdome. Some of them had twenty Bene∣fices with cure, and some more, and some of them had twenty Prebends, besides other great dignities. William Wickham at the death of William Edington Bishop of Win∣chester, was made generall Administratour of spirituall and temporall things pertaining to that Bishopricke, and the next yeare was made Bishop of Winchester. This Wickham besides the Archdeaconry of Lincolne, and Prouostship of Welles, and the Parsonage of Manihant in Deuonshire, had twelue Prebends. Simon Langham was Archbishop of Canterbury, and Chancelour of England. Iohn Barnet Bishop of Bath, and Treasurer of England. Godwin in vit. Wichami. The foresaid Wickham Keeper of the priuie Seale, Master of the Wards, and Treasurer of the Kings reuenues in France. Dauid Wellar Parson of Somersham, Master of the Rolles, seruing King Edward, in the Chancery fortie yeares and more. Ten beneficed Priests, Ciuilians, and Masters of the Chancery. William Mu se, Deane of S. Martins le Grand, chiefe Chamberlaine of the Exchequer, Receiuer, and Keeper of the Kings Treasure and Iewels. William Ashby, Archdeacon of Northampton, Chancellour of the Ex∣chequer. William Dighton, Prebendary of Saint Martins, Clerke of the priuie Seale. Richard Chesterfield, Prebendary of S. Stephens, Treasurer of the Kings house. Henry Snatch, Parson of Oundall, Master of the Kings Wardrobe. Iohn Newenham, Parson of Fenistanton, one of the Chamberlaines of the Exchequer, and keeper of the Kings Treasurie, and Iewels. Iohn Rouceby, Parson of Hardwicke, Surueior, and Controuler of the Kings works. Thomas Britingham, Parson of Ashby, Treasurer to the King, for the parts of Guisnes, and the marches of Caleis. Iohn Troys, Treasurer of Ireland, diuers wayes beneficed in Ireland. Pope Vrban the first, made a decree against the heaping together of many Benefices, or spirituall promotions by one man, for the execution whereof he sent commandement to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and by him to all his Suffragans, to certifie in writing, the names, number, and qualities, of euery Clerke, Benefices, or liuings, within their seuerall Dio∣cesse. Whereupon this or the like certificate was brought in. I finde, inter Breui Regis▪ Ed. 3. Ann. 24. that William Fox Parson of Lee neare Gainsborough, Ex Archiuis urris London. Iohn Fox, and Thomas of Lingeston, Friers Minors of that Couent in Lincolne, were indited before Gilbert Vmfreuill, and other Iustices, in partibus de Lindesey, apud Twhancaster, die Sabbati post festum s ncti Iohannis Baptiste, in the said yeare, for that they came to Bradholme, a Nunnery in the County of Nottingham, the eighteenth of the Kal. of February, and then and there rapuerunt, & abduxerunt inde, contra pacem Domini Regis, quandam Monialem nomine Margaretam de Euernigham Sororem dicte Domus, exeuntes eam habit. Religionis, & induen∣tes eam Rob. virid. secular. ac etiam diuersa bona ad valenc. quadragint. so∣lid. Violently tooke and forcibly from thence carried away, against the peace of their Soueraigne Lord the King, a certaine Nunne by name Mar∣garet de Euernigham, a sister of the said house, stripping her quite out of her religious habit, A greene Gowne giuen to a Nunne. and putting vpon her a greene Gowne, Robe, or Gar∣ment of the secular fashion, and also diuers goods to the value of forty shillings. In this Kings raigne Robert Longland a secular Priest, borne in Shrop∣shire, at Mortimers C liberie, writ bitter inuectiues against the Prelates, and all religious orders in those dayes, as you may reade throughout this book, which he calls, The vision of Piers Plowman. Presently after, in the raigne of Richard the second, Iohn Gower flourish∣ed, who in his booke called, A Manus. in Sir Robert Cot∣tons Library. Vox clamantis, cries out against the Clergie∣men of his time; first, Quod Christi scholam dogmatizant, & eius contrari∣um operantur. 2 Quod potentiores alijs existunt. 3 Quod carnalia appetentes vltra modum delicatè vinunt. 4 Quod lucris terrenis inhiant, honore Pre∣lacie gaudent, & non vt prosint, sed vt presint, Episcopatum desiderant. Quod legibus positi is quae quamuis ad cultum anime necessarie non sunt, in∣finitas tamen constitutiones quasi quotidie ad eorum lucrum nobis grauiter im∣pon t. Quod bona temporalia possidentes, spiritualia omittunt. Quod Chri∣stus pacem suis discipulis dedit & reliquit; sed Prelati propter bona ter∣rena guerras contra Christianos, legibus suis positiuis, instituunt, & prose∣quuntur. Quod cleri sunt bellicosi. Quod scribunt & docent ea quae sunt pa∣cis, sed in contrarium ea quae sunt belli procurant. Quod nomen sanctum sibi presumunt, appropriant tamen sibi terrena, nec alijs inde participando ex ca∣ritate subueniunt. Quod intrant Ecclesiam per Symoniam. Quod honores & non onera Prelacie plures affectant, quo magis in Ecclesia cessant virtutes, & vitia multipliciter accrescunt. Quod Rectores in curis residentes, cu s ta∣men negligentes, venationibus praecipue, & voluptatibus penitus intendunt. Quod Presbyteri sine curis, siue stipendarij non propter mundici m, & or∣dinis honestatem, sed propt r mundi otia gradum Presbyteratus appetunt & assumunt. Much more he speakes against the abuses and vices of Church∣men, as also against the lewd liues of the Schollars in Cambridge and Ox∣ford, which he calls the Churches plants: concluding thus his third book: Sic quia stat cecus morum sine lumine clerus Erramus Laici nos sine luce vagi. In his fourth booke hee speakes of Monkes, and all other religious Or∣ders: Quod contra primi ordinis statuta abstinentie virtutem linquunt, & delicias sibi corporales multipliciter assumunt. Ripping vp their faults in particular. Chaucer who was contemporarie and companion with Gower, in the Plowmans tale, the Romant of the Rose, and in his Treatise which hee in∣titles, lacke Vpland, writes as much, or more, against the pride, couetous∣nesse▪ insatiable luxurie, hypocrisie, blinde ignorance, and variable discord amongst the Church-men, and all other our English votaries. As also how rude and vnskilfull they were in matters and principles of our Christian institutions; to whose workes, now commonly in print, I referre my Rea∣der, for further satisfaction. In a Parliament holden at Westminster, the eleuenth yeare of King Hen∣ry the fourth, the lower house exhibited a Bill to the King and the Lords of the vpper house in effect as followeth. To the most excellent Lord our King, Tho. Walsing. Fabian The like bill or petition was exhibited in Parliament, an. 9. Ric. 2. and to all the Nobles in this pre∣sent Parliament assembled, your faithfull Commons doe humbly signifie, that our Soueraigne Lord the King might haue of the temporall possessi∣ons, lands, and reuenues which are lewdly spent, consumed, and wasted, by the Bishops, Abbats, and Priors, within this Realme; so much in value as would suffice to finde and sustaine one hundred and fifty Earles, one thousand and fiue hundred Knights, sixe thousand and two hundred Es∣quiers, and one hundred Hospitals, more then now be. Speed. Walsing. But this Petition of spoiling the Church of England of her goodly patri∣monies, which the pietie and wisedome of so many former ages had con∣gested, was by the King (who was bound by oath and reason to preserue the flourishing estate of the Church) so much detested, that for this their proposition, he denied all other their requests: and commanded them that from thenceforth they should not presume to intermeddle with any such matter. This King, as also his sonne, and grandchilde, were wondrous indulgent to the Clergie; although they were daily disquieted with the bellowing of the Popes Prouisorie Bulls. For Henry the fifth was so deuour and seruice∣able to the Church of Rome and her Chaplaines, that he was called of ma¦ny, the Prince of Priests. ox. Martyr. pag 6. vlt. Ed. And Henry the sixth, surnamed the holy, wa an obedient childe, and no lesse, nay more obsequious to the See Apostolicall, then any of his predecessours; howsoeuer I finde that once he reiected the Popes Bull, Arch. Turris London. An. 16. . 6. concerning the restoring of the Temporalities of the Bishop∣pricke of Ely. And now giue me leaue a little to digresse, speaking somewhat by the way of the denomination of this word Bulla, and why the Bishops of Rome call their leaden Seales, by which they confirme their writings, Bulls. This word Bulla was called , Ioseph. Castaleon. pag. 288. id est, à Consilio, of councell. For that anciently a golden Bull, broach, or ornament, round and hollow with∣in, was vsually fastened about the necks or breasts of young children, and semblablie to all their pictures, signifying thereby, that their render vn∣bridled age ought to be gouerned by the graue councell, and good aduise of others, of more maturitie in yeares. And from hence the Bishops of Rome borrowed the name for their leaden Seales; vpon one part of which the name of the Pope is to be read: on the other, the head of Saint Paul on the right side of the Crosse, and of Saint Peter on the left are to bee seene. Honoris tamen non praelationis gratia factitatum hoc ab Ecclesia. Nam quanquam S. Petrus sit Princeps Apostolici ordinis, tamen Ecclesia voluit eos indiscretae esse excellentiae. But this was done of the Church (saith my Author) in regard of honour, not of preheminence; For although Saint Peter be the head of the Apostolike Order, yet the Church will haue them to be of an vndistinct excellence. Now the Popes per liter as suas bullatas Regi directas, did preferre whom they pleased, and how they pleased, to any Ecclesiasticall promotion here in England. One example for all. Innocent the seuenth by his Bull preferred Richard Fleming, first to the Bishopricke of Lincolne, then to the Archbishopricke of Yorke, and last∣ly driue him backe againe by his roaring Bull to his first preferment of Lin∣colne. All which this King thus ratifies. Cum nuper summus Pontifex Richardum tunc Episcopum Lincoln: a vin∣culo quo eidem Ecclesie tenebatur absolnerit; Ex Arch. urris Lon. 2. pars. pat. An 4 Hen. 6. ad Ecclesiam Ebor: transtulerit. Nec non à vinculo quo eidem Ecclesie Ebor. cui tunc preerat, tenebatur, ab∣soluit ipsum; ad prefat. Lincoln. Ecclesiam duxerit restituend. & transfe∣rand. ipsumque in Episcopum Ecclesie Lincoln. prefecerit. Rex fidelitatem cepit ipsius Episcopi & restituit ei temporalia. Teste Rege apud West. 3. Au∣gusti. Such was the absolute authority of the Pope; In bib Cott. whose name (saith a namelesse Author) was neuer Peter, except you grant Saint Peter to bee one and the first, (howsoeuer many of them haue had that name giuen vn∣to them in baptisme) the reason whereof is thus diliuered: Nemo ex omnibus Romanorum Pontificibus Petri nomen sibi assumpsit, (etsi nonnulli in Baptismate ita nominati) ex quadam erga Apostolorum Principem reuerentia. Now let me returne, this Digression being much longer then I expect∣ed, as also this Chapter, which I will conclude as briefly as I may; in the meane while take this short story, which I finde in the fourth part of Sir Edward Cokes reports, Act. de Scandalis. The Abbot of S. Albons commanded his seruant to go into the Towne, An. 22. Ed. . Rot. 20. or some place neare adioyning, and to desire a certaine mans wife to come vnto him, with whom (he said) he had an earnest desire to talke: The ser∣uant obeyed, and (like a good trustie Roger) performed his Masters com∣mandement, in bringing the woman to his priuate chamber. Now so soone as the Abbot and the wife were together, the seruant (well knowing his masters minde) withdrew himselfe out of the way; and left them together alone in the chamber. The Abbot then began to accoast the wise; telling her first, that her array was meane, poore, and grosse array; to which she answered, That her array was according to her small abilitie, and the abi∣litie of her husband. The Abbot (knowing in what most of women take the greatest delight) told her that if she would be ruled by him, she should haue as good array to weare, as the best woman in the Parish where shee dwelt; and so began to sollicite her chastitie. The woman giuing no eare to his libidinous motions, the Abbot assaulted her with struglings and baudy embracings, thinking to get that by force which hee could not obtaine by faire meanes. But she still resisted all his encounters, promises, and perswa∣sions, by which he detained her in his chamber a long time against her will. The husband hauing notice of this abuse offered to his wife; began to talke of the matter, and said that he would haue an Action of false imprisonment against the Abbot, for detaining his wife against her will so long in his chamber. The Abbot hearing of this (adding one sinne to another) did sue the innocent poore husband in the Ecclesiasticall Court vpon an Action of defamation, because (forsooth) the husband had giuen out, and publish∣ed abroad, that my Lord Abbot would haue made his wife a dishonest wo∣man. The matter being opened in the Court, the husband had a Prohi∣bition, &c. This cunning sinne (amongst other their crimes) was vsually put in practise by the Church-men of other countries; witnesse Francis Petrarch Archdeacon of Parma in Italy, in one of his Epistles, sine titulo, to his namelesse friend; wherein he anatomises the Romane Clergie. Thus trans∣lated. Epist 0. Here Venus with her wanton toyes, Is honour'd with base bauds and boyes; Adulterie, whoredome, and incest, Is honour'd here among the best: And counted but for sports and playes Euen with our Prelats of these dayes. The wife is rauish'd from her spouse, And to the Papall seat she bowes. The poore go d man must leaue the Towne, Such ordinances are set downe: And when her bel e riseth hie, By Cardi als who with her lie, The husband must not dare complaine, But take his wife with childe againe. And dangerous it was for a Lay-man in Iohn Gowers dayes, to accuse any of the Clergie with a matter of truth. As you may perceiue by the sequele. Vox Clam. lib. 3. ca. 21. Hoc dicit clerus quod quamuis crimine plenus Sit, non est laici ponere crimenei. Alter & alterius cleri peccata fauore Excusat, quod in hijs stat sine lege reus. Non occusari vult à caliis, tamen illos Accusat, que sibi libera frena petit. Libera sunt ideo peccata placentia Clero Sit nisi quod Laici iura ferantur ibi. Presbiter insipiens populum facit insipientem, Et mala multa parit, qui bona pauca sapit. Plough mans le. Chaucer writes of the same. Mennes wiues they wollen hold, And though that they been right sorye, To speake they shull not bee so bold For sompning to the Consistory: And make hem saie mouth I lie Though they it sawe with her iye, His Lemman holden openly No man so hardy to aske why. They aine to no man that it longeth To reproue them though they erre. Sir Thomas Moore reports how (in this kings dayes) a poore man found a Priest ouer-familiar with his wife; Camd. Re iq. and because hee spake it abroad, and could not proue it, the Priest sued him before the Bishops Officiall for de∣famation, where the poore man in paine of cursing was commanded, that in his Parish Church, he should vpon the Sonday stand vp, and say, Mouth thou liest. Whereupon for fulfilling of his penance, vp was the poore soule set in a pew, that the people might wonder at him, and heare what hee said; and there all aloud (when he had rehearsed what he had reported by the Priest) then he set his hands on his mouth, and said, Mouth thou liest. And by and by thereupon, he set his hands vpon both his eyes, and said, But eyne, by the Masse, ye lie not a whit. Abbots and Priours in these dayes did ouer-awe all sorts of lay-people, yea the greatest Potentates: which made Edward the fourth write thus to the Priour of Lewes in Sussex, more like a poore petitioner then a great Prince, concerning a matter wherein the Prior and Couent went about to cosin his seruant Vincent. Deare and welbeloued in God, Transcribed out of the o ginall. we greet you well: and wher we been enformyd yat many yeres past, by yowr letters endentyd, vndre yowr Cou∣uent Seal, grauntyd to owr trusty and welbelowed servant, Iohn Vincent, Esquyr, fader to owr ryght welbelowed seruant Bryan Vincent, certain of yowr londes and rentes within yowr Lordshyp of Conesburgh; to haue to the seyd Iohn, and to his heyres, beryng therfor a certayn yerly rent spe∣cyfyd in yowr seyd indentures, and afterwards the seyd Iohn, and Bryan his son, hadd of yowr graunt, the same londes and tenements, with othyr, by yowr othyr indentures, yervpon made betwex yow & tham, whych enden∣tures wer seald by yow, and the seyd Iohn in thabsens of his seyd son, dely∣uered and left in yowr kepyng of trust, and soon aftyr fortuned him to be sleyne, at the lamentable conflyct of Wakfeld, in the seruice of the ryghte noble and famous Prynce owr fader whom God rest: And now, as we hear, ye labor and entend to put owr seyd servant hys son from the seyd londes and tenements, contrary to yowr fyrst and latyr graunte, a for expressyd, and agenst ryght, and good conscyens, yf hit be as is surmysed: We therfor exhort, and desyr yow to suffre owr seyd servant to have, and enioy the seyd londs and tenements according to yowr forseyd couenants, and graunts, and to delyuer vnto him the seyd later endentures concerning the same, as his fader so left of trust in yowr kepyng; And beside that to shew to owr seyd servant in any othyr matyrs lawfull and reasonable, that he shall a have adoo with yow, yowr beneuolences and herty fauors; and the rathyr, and mor especyally at owr instance and contemplacyon of theys owr letters; wherin ye shall not only doo vs a singular plasur, but caus vs, for the sam, to have yow and yowr plas, in the mor herty fauor and recomendacyon of owr good grase.

To ouerpasse the short time during the Protectorship and raigne of King Richard the third, let vs come vnto Henry the seuenth, in whose dayes reli∣gious persons did wallow in all kindes of voluptuousnesse; to the Kings no little griefe, who by his breeding vnder a deuout mother, as also in his owne nature was euer a zealous obseruer of religious formes. To bridle whose in∣continent liues, he caused an Act to be made bearing this title. An Act to punish Priests for their incontinencie. Of which, so much as will serue for this purpose: Item. For the more sure and likely reformation of Priests, Clerks, and religious men, In Pa l. anno 3. Hen. 7. cap. 4. culpable, or by their demerits openly reported of inconti∣nent liuing in their bodies, contrary to their Order: It is enacted, ordained, and stablished by the aduice and assent of the Lords spirituall and tempo∣rall, and the Commons in the said Parliament assembled, and by authority of the same, That it be lawfull to all Archbishops, and Bishops, and other Ordinaries, hauing Episcopall iurisdiction, to punish and chastice Priests, Clerks, and religious men, being within the bounds of their iurisdiction, as shall be conuicted before them by examination and other lawfull profe, requisite by the Law of the Church, of Aduoutrie, Fornication, Incest, or any other fleshly incontinencie, by committing them to ward and prison, there to abide for such time, as shall be thought to their discretions conue∣nient, for the qualitie, and quantitie of their trespasse: And that none of the said Archbishops, Bishops, or other Ordinaries aforesaid, be thereof charge∣able, of, to, or vpon any Action of false or wrongfull imprisonment, but that they be vtterly thereof discharged in any of the cases aforesaid, by ver∣tue of this Act. In his sonnes raigne, the Pope being (here in England) at the point ver∣ticall of his all-commanding power, and religious Orders growne to the height of their abominable sinnes, both of them had a sudden downfall, as will appeare in the subsequent Chapters. But of the pietie and impuritie of Monkes and other religious Votaries, of the first and latter times, take for a conclusion of this, as also of the pre∣cedent Chapter, these riming Hexameters as I haue them out of the booke of Rufford Abbey, in Nottinghamshire: a Manuscript in Sir Robert Cottons Librarie. Inuectio Walonis Britonis in Monachos. Sacrilegis Monachis emptoribus Ecclesiarum Composui Satyram. Ordo Monasticus Ecclesiasticus esse solebat, Dura cibaria dum per agrestia rura colebat. Nulla pecunia, nulla negocia prepediebant, Sobria copia, parua colonia sufficiebant. Pro venialibus & capitalibus inuigilabant; Tam venalia quam capitalia nostra placebant. Ordo Monasticus Ecclesiasticus est violenter Ecclesiastica comparat omna dona potenter. Ordo Monasticus Ecclesiasticus est sine fructu, Intrat ouilia desuper ostia non sine luctu. Ordo Monasticus Ecclesiasticus est sine causa, Clamat ad ostia spiritualia iam sibi clausa. Ordo Monasticus Ecclesiasticus inde vocatur, Quando rapacibus atque tenacibus assimulatur. Terra, pecunia, magna Palatia, templa parantur Vnde potencia, siue superbia magnificantur. Desunt caetera. CHAP. XIII. Of the abrogation, abolition, and extinguishment of the Popes supreme and exorbitant authoritie, within the King of Englands Dominions. KIng Henry the eighth vpon occasion of delay, made by Pope Clement the seuenth, in the controuersie of diuorcement betwixt him and Queene Katherine, and through displeasure of such reports as hee heard had beene made of him to the Court of Rome: or else pricked forward by some of his Counsellours, to follow the example of the Germanes; caused Proclamation to be made on the eighteenth day of September, In bib. Cott. Anno reg. 22. forbidding all his subiects to purchase or attempt to purchase any man∣ner of thing from the Court of Rome, containing matter preiudiciall to the high authoritie, iurisdiction and prerogatiue Royall of this Realme; or to the hinderance and impeachment of the Kings Maiesties noble and vertu∣ous intended purposes. Vpon paine of incurring his Highnesse indigna∣tion, and imprisonment, and further punishment of their bodies, for their so doing, at his Graces pleasure, to the dreadfull example of all other. Not long after, Ex Parl. an. 24. Hen. 8. cap. 12. it was enacted, that appeale , such as had been vsed to be pursued to the See of Rome, should not be from thenceforth, had, neither vsed but within this Realme; and that euerie person offending against this Act, should runne into the dangers, paines, and penalties, of the Estatute of the Prouision and Premunire, made in the fiue and twentieth yeare of the raigne of King Edward the third; and in the sixteenth yeare of King Ri∣chard the second. And shortly after this, it being thought by the ignorant vulgar people; that to speake against any of the lawes, decrees, ordinances, and constitu∣tions of the Popes, made for the aduancement of their worldly glorie and ambition, Ex. Parl. an. 25. Hen. 8 ca. 21. was damnable heresie; it was enacted that no manner of speak∣ing, doing, communication, or holding against the Bishop of Rome, called the Pope, or his pretensed authoritie or power, made or giuen by humane lawes or policies, and not by holy Scripture; nor any speaking, doing, communication, or holding against any Lawes, called Spirituall Lawes, made by authoritie of the See of Rome, by the policie of men, which were repugnant and contrariant to the Lawes and Statutes of this Realme, or the Kings Prerogatiue royall, should be deemed, reputed, accepted, or taken to be Heresie. It was also enacted that no manner of appeales, In eod. Parl. cap. 19. should be had prouoked, or made, out of this Realme, or any the Kings dominions to the Bishop of Rome, or to the See of Rome, in any causes or matters, happening to be in contention, and hauing their commensement and beginning in any of the Courts within this Realme, or within any the Kings dominions, of what nature, condition, or qualitie soeuer they were. Vpon this followed another Act, In eod Parl. cap. 20. restraining the payment of Annates, or first-fruits, to the Bishop of Rome, and of the electing and consecrating of Bishops within this Realme. Another Act was made concerning the exoneration of the Kings Sub¦iects, In eod Parl. cap. 20. from exactions and impositions, theretofore paied to the See of Rome, and for hauing licences and dispensations within this Realme, without suing further for the same: in which the Commons assembled complaine to his Maiestie, that the subiects of this Realme, and other his dominions, were greatly decaied and impouerished by intollerable exactions of great summes of money, claimed and taken by the Bishop of Rome, and the See of Rome, as well in pensions, censes, Peter-pense, procurations, fruits, sutes for pro∣uisions, and expeditions of Bulls for Archbishoprickes and Bishopricks, and for delegacies of rescripts in causes of contentions, and appeales, iuris∣dictions, legatiue; and also for dispensations, licences, faculties, grants, re∣laxations, Writs, called Perinde valere, rehabitations, abolitions, and other infinite sorts of Bulls, breeues, and instruments of sundrie natures, names, and kindes, in great numbers, ouer long and tedious here particularly to be inserted. S o . Annal. It was affirmed in this Parliament, that there had been paied to the Pope of Rome onely for Bulls, by our English Bishops, and other of the king∣dome, since the fourth of Henry the seuenth to that time, threescore thou∣sand pound sterling. An. 2 . Hen. 8. c p. 1. The next yeare following, in a Parliament begun at Westminster, the third of Nouember, the Pope with all his authoritie was cleane banished this Realme, and order taken that he should no more bee called Pope, but Bishop of Rome; and the King to be taken and reputed as supreme head in earth of the Church of England, called Anglicana Ecclesia. And that hee their Soueraigne Lord, his heires and successours kings of this Realme, should haue full power and authoritie, from time to time, to visit, represse, redresse, reforme, order, correct, restraine, and amend all such e rours, he∣resies, abuses, offences, contempts, and enormities whatsoeuer they were, which by any manner spirituall authoritie or iurisdiction, ought or might lawfully bee reformed, repressed, ordered, redressed, corrected, restrained, or amended, most to the pleasure of Almighty God, the increase of vertue in Christs religion, and for the conseruation of peace, vnitie, and tranqui∣litie of this Realme, any vsage, custome, forraine lawes, forraine authority, prescription, or any thing, or things, to the contrary thereof notwith∣standing. Cap In this Parliament also were granted to the King and his heires, the first-fruits and tenths of all spirituall dignities and promotions. . Hen. 8. cap. . His stile of supremacie was further ratified, and declared to bee set downe in this forme and manner following: in the Latine tongue by these words. Henricus octauus Dei gratia, Angliae, Franciae, & Hiberniae Rex, Fidei defensor, & in terra Ecclesiae Anglicanae & Hibernicae supremum caput. In the English tongue by these: Henry the eight, by the grace of God, King of England, France, and Ire∣land, defendour of the faith, and of the Church of England, and also of Ire∣land in earth, the supreme head. Which stile was enacted, to bee vnited and annexed for euer to the im∣periall Crowne of this his Highnesse Realme of England. Vpon the first expulsion of the Popes authoritie, and King Henries vn∣dertaking of the Supremacie; the Priests both religious and secular, did, openly in their Pulpits, so farre extoll the Popes iurisdiction and authority, that they preferred his lawes before the kings; yea and before the holy pre∣cepts of God Almighty. Whereupon the King sent his mandatory letters to certaine of his Nobilitie, and others in especiall office, thinking thereby to restraine their seditious false doctrine and exorbitancie. And here let me tell you that amongst many letters of important affaires, which I found in certaine Chandlers shops of our Parish, allotted to light Tobacco pipes, and wrap vp peniworths of their commodities (all which I gaue to Sir Ro∣bert Cotton, Knight and Baronet, the onely repairer of ruined antiquirie, whom I knew (the contents therof shewing some passages of former times) would preserue them for better vses; I happened vpon certaine letters fol∣lowing tending to the same purpose: of which I haue already spoken. Henry R. By the King. RIght trusty and right welbiloued Cousin we grete you well. And wher it is commen to our knowlaige that sundry persons, aswell religious as seculer Priests and curats in their peroches and d ue se places within this our Realme, do dailly asmoche as in them is, set fo the, and extolle the iu∣risdiction and auctoritie of the Bishop of Rome, ortherwyse called Pope, sowing their sediciouse pestylent and false doctryne, praying for him in the Pulpit, and makyng hym a God, to the greate deceyte, illudyng and sedu∣cyng of our subgietts, bryngyng them into errors, sedicyon, and euyll opy¦nyons, more preferryng the power, lawes, and Iurisdictyon of the said Bishop of Rome, then the most holly lawes and precepts of almighty God. We therfore myndyng not only to prouide for an vnitie and quietnes to be had and contynued among our said subgietts, but also greatly cou tyng and desyryng them to be brought to a perfectyon and knawlege of the mere veritie and truth, and no longer to be seduced, nor blynded, with any suche superstitiouse and false doctryne of any erthly vsurper of godds lawes, will therfore and commaund you, that wher and whensoeuer ye shall fynde, ap¦perceyve, know, or heretell, of any such sedicious personnes, that in suche wise do spreade, teche, and preache, or otherwise set forth any su he opy¦nyons and perniciouse doctryne; to the exaltatyon of the power of the bi∣shop of Rome, bryngyng therby our subgietts into error, gruge, and mur∣muracyon; that ye indelaydly doo apprehend and take them, or cause them to be apprehended and taken, and so commytted to Ward ther to remayne without bayle or mayneprise, vntill vpon your aduertisement therof vnto vs or our Councell ye shall know our further pleasure in that behalfe. Ye uen vndre our Signet, at our Manor of Grenwich the xvii day of Aprill. This letter was thus endorsed: To our right trusty and welbiloued cou∣sin and Counsellor Therle of Sussex. In Iune or Iuly following, these maiesticall commanding Epistles were seconded, and made more strong by an Act of Parliament, called, An Act extinguishing the authoritie of the Bishop of Rome. Of which I hold it not amisse to set downe so much as principally tends to the purpose. To begin then at the beginning. For as much as notwithstanding the good and wholesome lawes, Ex Parl. an. 28. Hen. 8. ca. 10. ordi∣nances, and statutes heretofore made, enacted, and established by the kings Highnesse, our most gratious souereigne Lord, and by the whole consent of the high Court of Parliament, for the extirpation, abolition, and extin∣guishment out of this Realme, and other his graces dominions, seigniories, and countries, of the pretended power and vsurped authoritie of the Bishop of Rome, by some called the Pope, vsed within the same or elsewhere, con∣cerning the same realme, dominions, segniories, or countries, whi h did obfuscat and wrest Gods holy word and Testament a long season from the spirituall and true meaning thereof, to his worldly and carnall affections: as pompe, glory, auarice, ambition, and tyrannie, couering and shadow∣ing the same with his humane and politike deuises, traditions, and inuen∣tions, set forth to promote and stablish his onely dominion, both vpon the soules, and also the bodies and goods of all Christian people, excluding Christ out of his kingdome and rule of mans soule, as much as hee may, and all other temporall Kings and Princes out of their dominions; which they ought to haue by Gods law, vpon the bodies and goods of their sub∣iects: whereby he did not onely rob the Kings Maiestie, being onely the supreme head of this his Realme of England, immediately vnder God, of his honour, right, and preheminence, due vnto him by the law of God, but spoiled his Realme yearely of innumerable treasure, and with the losse of the same deceiued the Kings louing and obedient subiects, perswading to them by his lawes, buls, and other his deceiuable meanes, such dreames, vanities, and fantasies, as by the same many of them were seduced and con ueied vnto superstitious and erroneous opinions; So that the Kings Ma∣iestie, the Lords Spirituall and Temporall, and the Commons in this Realme, being ouer-wearied and fatigated with the experience of the infi∣nite abhominations and mischiefes, proceeding of his impostures, and craf∣tily colouring of his deceits, to the great dammages of soules, bodies, and goods, were forced of necessitie for the publike weale of this Realme, to exclude that forraine pretended iurisdiction and authoritie, vsed and vsur∣ped within this Realme, and to deuise such remedies for their reliefe in the same, as doth not onely redound to the honour of God, the high praise and aduancement of the Kings Maiestie, and of his Realme, but also to the great and inestimable vtilitie of the same; And notwithstanding the said wholesome lawes so made and heretofore established, yet it is common to the knowledge of the Kings highnesse, and also to diuerse and many his lo uing, faithfull, and obedient subiects, how that diuers seditious and con∣tentious persons, being imps of the said Bishop of Rome and his See, and in heart members of his pretended Monarchie, doe in corners, and elsewhere as they dare, whisper, inculke, preach, and perswade, and from time to time instill into the eares and heads of the poore simple and vnlettered people, the aduancement and continuance of the said Bishops feined and pretended authoritie, pretending the same to haue his ground and originall of Gods law, whereby the opinions of many bee suspended, their iudgements cor∣rupted and deceiued, and diuersitie in opinions augmented and increased, to the great displeasure of almighty God, the high discontentation of our said most dread soueraigne Lord, and the interruption of the vnitie, loue, charitie, concord, and agreement that ought to bee in a Christian Region and congregation. For auoiding whereof, and repression of the follies of such seditious persons, as be the meanes and authours of such inconueni∣ences: Be it enacted, ordained, and established by the King our soueraigne Lord and the Lords spirituall and temporall, and the Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authoritie of the same, that if any person or persons, dwelling, demurring, inhabiting, or resiant within this Realme, or within any other the Kings dominions, seigniories, or coun∣tries, or the marches of the same, or elsewhere within or vnder his obeizance and power, of what estate, dignitie, preheminence, order,, degree, or condi∣tion soeuer hee or they bee, after the last day of Iuly, which shall bee in the yeare of our Lord God, 1536. shall by writi g, ci ering▪ printing, preach ing, or teaching, deed or act, obstinately or maliciously, hold or st nd with, to extoll, set foorth, maintaine, or defend the authoritie, iurisdiction, or power of the Bishop of Rome, or of his See, heretofore claimed, vsed or vsurped within this Realme, or in any dominion or countrey, being or, with∣in, or vnder the Kings power or obeisance: or by any presence obstinately or maliciously inuent any thing▪ for the extolling, aduancement, setting forth, maintenance, or defence of the same, or any part thereof, or by any pretence obstinately or maliciously attribute any manner of iurisdiction, authoritie, or preheminence to the said See of Rome, or to any Bishop of the same See for the time being within this Realme, or in any the Kings dominions and countries: That then euery such person or persons, so do∣ing or offending, their aiders, assistants, comfortors, abettors, procurers, maintainers, fautors, counsellours, conceilours, and euery of them, being thereof lawfully conuicted, according to the Lawes of this Realme; for euery such default, and offence, shall incurre and runne into the dangers, penalties, paines, and forfeitures, ordeined and prouided by the statute of Prouision and Premunire, made in the sixteenth yeare of the reigne of the noble and valiant Prince King Richard the second, against such as attempt, procure, or make prouision to the See of Rome, or elsewhere, for any thing or things, to the derogation, or contrarie to the Prerogatiue royall, or iuris∣diction of the Crowne, and dignitie of this Realme. King Henry still hearing of the murmuring of his Subiects, vpon the en∣acting of this Statute, writes againe to his principall magistrates in euery countrey, in this manner following. Henry R. By the King. TRusty and welbeloued we grete yow well; And wheras heretofore as ye know both vpon most iust and vertuouse fowndacions grownded vpon the lawes of Almighty God, and holy Scripture; And also by the deliberate aduice, consultacion, consent and agreement aswell of the Bi∣shops and Clergie, as by the Nobles and Commons temporall of this owr realme, assembled in owr high Court of Parliament, and by auctorite of the same; the abuses of the Bisshop of Rome his auctorite and iurisdiction, of long time vsurped against vs, haue been not onely vtterly extirped, abolish∣ed, and secluded; but also the same owr Nobles and Commons both of the Clergie and Temporalty by an other seuerall Acte, and vpon like funda∣cion for the publike weale of this our realme, haue vnited, knytte, and an∣nexed to vs and the Crowne imperiall of this our realme, the title, dignitie, and stile of Supreme hed in erthe, immediatly vndre God, of the Church of England; as vndoubtedly euermore we haue ben; which thing also the said Bisshops and Clergie particularly in their Conuocacions haue holly and entyrely consented, recognised, ratifyed, confirmed, and approued authen∣tiquely in wryting both by their speciall othes, profession and wryting vnder their Signes and Seales, so vtterly reuouncyng all other othes, obe∣dience, and iurisdiction, either of the said Bisshop of Rome, or of any other Potentate. We late yow witt that prependyng and consideryng, the charge and commission, in this behalfe geuen vnto vs by almighty God togedre with the great quietnes, rest, and tranquillity that hereby may ensue to owr faithfull Subgiects, both in their conscience and otherwise, to the pleasure of almighty God, in cace the sayd Bisshops and Clergie of this our realme shuld sincerely, truly and faithfully sett furth, declare and preche vnto our sayd Subgiects the veray true word of God, and without all maner color dissimulacion and hipocrisie, manifest, publishe and declare the great and innumerable enormities and abuses, which the said Bisshop of Rome, as well in title and stile, as also in auctorite and iurisdiction of long time vnlaw∣fully and iniustly hath vsurped vpon vs our Progenitors and all other Chri∣sten Princes; haue not onely addressed our letters generall to all and euerye the same Bisshops straitely charging and commaundyng them, not only in their propre persons to declare teche and preche vnto the people the true, mere, and sincere word of God, and how the said title, stile, and iurisdiction of supreme hed apperteyneth to vs, our Crowne and dignitie royall; and to gyve like warnyng, monicion, and charge to all Abbots, Priors, Deanes, Archdeacons, Prouosts, Parsons, Vicars, Curats, Scolemasters, and all other Ecclesiasticall persons within their Diocesses to do the semblable; in their Churches euery Sunday and solempne feast, and also in their scoles: And to cause all maner prayers, orysons, Rubricks, and Canons in Massebokes, and all other bokes vsed in Churches, wherein the sayd Bisshop is named, vtterly to be abolished, eradicated, and rased, in soche wise as the said Bis∣shop of Rome, his name and memory for euermore (except to his contu∣mely and reproche) may be extinct, suppressed, and obscured. But also to the Iustices of our Peace, that they in euery place within the precinct of their Commissions do make and cause to be made diligent serche, wayte, and espiall whedder the sayd Bisshops and Clergie doo truly and sincerely, without any manner cloke, or dissimulacyon execute accomplish their said charge, to them committed in this behalf. And to certifye vs and our Councail of such of them as shuld omytt or leaue vndone any parte of the premises, or ells in the execucyon thereof shuld coldely or faynedly vse any maner synistre addicyon interpretacion or cloke, as more plainly is expressed in our said letters. We consideryng the great good, and furthe∣raunce, that ye may doo in thise matiers in the parties about yow, and spe∣cially at your being at Sises and Sessions, in the declaracion of the premisses, haue thought it good, necessary, and expedient to write thise letters vnto yow, whom wee esteme to be of soch singler zeale and affection, towards the glory of Almighty God, and of so faithfull and louing harte towards vs, as ye woll not only with all your wisdoms, diligences, and labors ac∣complishe all soche things as might be to the preferment and setting for∣wards of Gods word, and the amplification, defence, and maintenance of our said interesse, right, title, stile, iurisdiction, and auctorite apperteyning vnto vs, our dignitie, prerogatiue, and Corone imperiall of this our realme; will and desire you, and neuerthelesse straitely charge and command you, that laying aparte all vayn affections, respects, and carnall consideracions, and setting before your ees the mirror of truth, the glory of God, the right and dignitie of your Soueraigne Lord, thus sounding to the inestimable vnitie and commoditie both of your selfes, and all other our louing and faithfull Subgiects; ye doo not only make diligent serche within the pre∣cinct of your Commission and auctorite, whedder the said Bisshops and Clergie doo truly and sincerly as before preche, teche, and declare to the people the premisses according to their dutyes; but also at your said sitting in Sises and Sessions ye doo perswade, shew, and declare vnto the said peo∣ple, the veray tenor, effect, and purpose of the premisses, in soch wise as the said Bisshops and Clergie may the better not only doo therby and exe∣cute their said duties, but also the parents, and rulers of families, may de∣clare, teche, and informe their childer and servaunts in the specialties of the same, to the vtter extirpacion of the said Bisshops vsurped auctoritie, name, and iurisdiction for euer. Shewing and declaring also to the people, at your said Sessions, the treasons treacherously committed against vs, and our lawes, by the late Bisshop of Rochester and Sir Thomas More knight, who therby, and by diuerse secrete practises of their maliciouse mynds against vs, entended to seminate, engender, and brede amongst our people and subgiects a most mischieuous and sediciouse opynyon not only to their own confusion, but also of diuers others, who lately haue condignely suffered execucion, according to their demerites: And in soche wise dila∣ting the same with persuacions, to the same our people, as they may be the better rixed, established and satisfyed in the truth; and consequently that all our faythfull and true subgiects may therby detest and abhorre in their hartes and heads, the most recreaunt and trayterouse abuses and behavi∣ors of the said maliciouse malefactors as they be most worthy. And finding any defaulte, negligence, or dissimulacion in any maner of person or per∣sons, not doing his duty in this partie. Ye immediatly doo advertise vs and our Counsail of the defaulte, maner and facion of the same, Lating you witt, that considering the great moment, weight, and importaunce of this matter, as wherevpon dependeth the vnitie, rest, and quietnes of this our Realme, yf ye shuld contrary to your duties, and our expectation and trust, neglect, be slake, or omytte to doo diligently your duties, in the true per∣formaunce and execucion of our mynde, pleasure, and commaundement as before; or wold haulte, stumble at any parte, or specialtie of the same; Be ye assured that we, like a Prince of Iustice, will so punyshe and correct your defaulte and negligence therin, as it shal be an example to all others how contrary to their allegiance, othes, and duties, they doo frustrate, de∣ceiue, and disobey the iust and lawfull commaundement of their soueraigne Lord, in such things, as by the true harty and faithfull execucion whereof, they shall not only prefer the honor and glory of God, and sett forth the maiestie and imperiall dignitie of their soueraign Lord, but also importe and bring an inestimable vnitie, concord, and tranquillitie of the publike and common state of this Realme: whereunto both by the lawes of God, and nature, and man, they be vtterly obliged and bounden. And therfore faile ye not most effectually, ernestly, and entierly to see the premises done, and executed; vpon paine of your allegeance, & as ye well advoyd our high indignacion and displeasure at your vtmost perils. Y euen vndre our Signet, at our Manor besids Westminster the xxv day of Iune. Henry R. By the King: TRusty and welbeloued we grete yow well; And whereas we chiefly and principally regarding and tendring the quiet, rest, prosperite, and tranquillite of our Nobles and Commons, and their conservacion no lesse then our own; directed lately our letters vnto you and other Iustices of our Peace throughout this our Realme, conteyning our admonicion and gen∣till warenyng, to haue such speciall regard to the dewties of your offices ac∣cordyng to the trust we haue in yow; that not only for thymportance it is both vnto vs and our common welth, ye shuld see our high dignite of Supremacie of our Church (wherwith it hath pleased almighty God by his most certain and vndoubted word to endowe, and adorne, our auchtorite, and Corone imperiall of this our Realme) to be set forth and impressed in all our Subiects harts and mynds, and to forsee that the mayntenors of the Bisshop of Roomes vsurped and fayned auctorite, with all his Papisticall supersticions and abuses, wherwith he hath in times past abused the mul∣titud of our subgiects (of whose yoke, tyranny, and skornefull illusion we haue by Gods porveiaunce deliuered this our realme, and of other his Sa∣tellites whiche secretly did vphold his faction) shuld be by yow diligently serched, enqwired, and tried owt, and so broughte to our Iustices to re∣ceaue condigne punyshement, according to their demerits; but also that tale tellers about the cuntriee, and spraders of rumours, and false inventors of newes, to put owr people to feare, and stirr them to sedicyon, shulde be apprehended, and punyshed to the terrible example of others. Also that vagabonds and valiant Beggers shalbe avoyded and haue worthy correcti∣ons. And for the same purpose to kepe watches, and to see commen Iu∣stice with indifferency, and without corrupcion to be obserued and mini∣stred, vnto all owr Subgiects like as by the porporte and contents of our said Letters ye may more amplie perceiue. We haue thervpon ben creda∣bly enformed that sondry of yow haue, for a time, so well done yowr dew∣ties, and endeuoired your selues in fulfilling our admonitions, and caused the euill doers to be punyshed according to their demerites, that our louing Subgiects haue not ben disquieted of a long season, vntill now of late that sum vngracious, cankred, and maliciouse persons haue taken boldnes to at∣tempt, with sondry diuelish persuasions to moue and seduce our trewe sub∣giects, vsing false lies, and most vntrewe rumors; And amonst them we vn∣derstand, sondry Parsons, Vicars, and Curats of this our Realme to be chieffe; which to bring our people to darkenes, of their own perverse mynde, not only to blynde our Commons, do rede so confusely, hemming and hacking the word of God and soche our Iniunctions, as we haue lately set forthe, that almost no man can vnderstand the trewe meanyng of the said Iniunctions, but also secretly haue suborned certeyne spreders of Ru∣mors and false tales in corners, which doo interpreat and wrast our trewe meanyng and intention of owr said Iniunctions to an vntrewe sense. For wheras we haue ordeyned by owr said Iniunctions for thavoyding of son∣dry striues, processis, and contentions, risyng vpon aege, vpon lineall dis∣cents, vpon title of Inheritances, vpon legittimation or Bastardie, and for knowlege whither any person is our subiect borne or no; Also for sondry other causes, that the names of all childer christened from hensforth with ther birth, ther fathers and mothers names, and likewise all mariages, and burialls, with the time and date thereof shuld be registred from time to time in a boke in euery Parish Church, surely and safe y to be kept. They haue bruted and blowen abrode most falsely and vntrewely that we doo entende to make some new exactions at all christenyngs, weddings, and burials: The whiche in no wise we euer meaned or thought vpon, a leging (for to forte∣fy and color there false and manif st lies) that therin we go abowt to take away the liberties of the realme. For conservacion wherof they fayne that Bisshop Beckett of Canterbury, which they haue to fore called Saynt Tho∣mas, died for where in dede there was neuer soch thing done, nor ment in that time nor sithens. For the said Beckett neuer swarved nor contended with owr progenitor Kyng Henry the second, but only to lett that those of the Clergie shuld not be punyshed for their offences, nor iustyfyed by the Courts and lawes of this Realme, but only at the Bisshops pleaser, and after the decrees of Roome. And the causes why he died, was vpon a wilfull re∣skewe and a fray by him made and begon at Canterbury; Which was ne∣uerthelesse afterward alleged to be for soche liberties of the Churche which he contendyd for, during his life, with tharchbisshop of Yorke: chiefly to haue soche priuiledge that no Kyng of England ought euer to be crowned by any other Bisshop but oonly by the Bishops of Canterbury. Yea and in case he shuld be absent or fugitiue out of the Realme, the Kyng shuld neuer be coroned by any other, but constrayned to abide his retorne. These and soche other detestable and vnlawfull liberties of the Church, nothing con∣cerning the common weale, but only the partie of the Clergie, the said Thomas Becket most arrogantly desyred, and trayterouslye sewyd to haue, contrary to the law of this our Realme. To the which most false interpre∣tacions and wrasting of our trewe meanyng, they haue ioyned such mys∣cheuous lyes and false tales for markyng of catals, and like seditious devises; wherevpon owr people were lately stirred to sedition, and insurrection, to ther vtter ruyne and destruction; onles almighty God (who by his diuine prouidence gaue vnto vs habundance of force, as he alwaies dothe vnto rightfull Princes) had so with clemencie illumyned vs, that where as we with thedge of the swerde, and by our lawes might haue ouerthrowen and destroyed them, there wyues, children and posterite for euer, we neuerthe∣lesse, as ye can right well remember, extended vpon them at that time, our benigne and mercifull pardon. These miserable and Papisticall superstiti∣ous wretches, nothing regarding the same, nor caring what danger and myschiefe our people shuld incurre, haue both raysed the said olde rumors, and forged new sedicious tales, intendyng, asmoche as in them lyeth, a new commotion, and all to satisfye there cankred harts. Wherfore and for the imminent daunger to yow, and all our good subgiects, and the troble that might ensewe, onlesse good and ernest prouision to represse them, be taken thervpon; We desyre and pray yow, and neuerthelesse straytly charge and commaund yow, that within the Precinct and lymyts of yowr charge; ye shall not only endeuor your self, and employ your most diligence, to in∣quyre and fynd owt such cankerd Parsons, Vicars, and Curats, which doo not trewly and substancially declare our said Iniunctions, and the very worde of God, but momble confusely, seying that they be compelled to rede them; and bydd ther Parishens neuerthelesse to doo as they did in times past, to lyue as ther fathers, and that the olde fashion is the best, and other crafty sedicious parables. But also with your most effectuall vigilan∣cy, doo enserche and trie owt such sedicious tale tellers, and spreders abrode of suche brutes, tydings, and rumors, touching vs in honor, or suretie of the state of our Realme, or any matacion of the lawes or customes therof▪ or any other thing which might cause any sedicion. And the same with ther setters forthe, maintenors, counsaylors, and fautors with all dilygence to apprehend, and commytt to warde and prison without bayle or mayn∣prise, till vpon euidence to be geuen against them, at tharriuall of our Iu∣stices in that cuntrey, or otherwise vpon yowr advertisement to vs, or our Counsaill to be geuen, and our further pleaser knowen, they may be pu∣nyshed for their seditious demerites, accordyng to the law: to the fearfull example of all other. Imploying and endeuoring yowr selfes therunto so ernestly and with soche dexterite, as we may haue cause to thinke that ye be the men, which aboue all things desyre the punyshment of evill doers and offendors. And will lett for no trauaile, to sett forthe all things for the commen peace, quiet, and tranquillite of this our Realme. And like as the daunger is imminent no lesse to your self and your neighbours then to other; so ye of yowr owne mynd shuld procure and see with celerite our Iniunctions, lawes, and Proclamations, aswell touching the Sacramentaries, and Anabaptists, as other to be sett forthe to the good instruction and con∣servacion of our people, and to the confusion of those which wold so craftely vndermine our common welth, and at the last destroye bothe yow and all other our louing subgiects, although we shuld geue vnto yow no such admonicion. Therfore faile ye not to follow the ffect, admonicion, and commaundement both in our said letters, and in these presents contey∣ned, and to communicate the hole tenor of these our letters, with soche Iustices of our Peace, your neighbors and other in that shire, and to geue vnto them the trewe copye thereof: exhorting them, like as by these pre∣sents we desyre, and pray them, and neuerthelesse straytly charge and com∣maund them, and euery of them, that they will shew their diligence, to∣wardnes, and good inclinacion to ioyne with you and other of your sorte, And that euery of yow for his own parte see the same put in execucion ac∣cordingly, as ye and they tendre our pleasur, and will deserue our condigne thankes. Y euen vndre our Signet at our Manor of Hampton Corte the day of December. CHAP. XIIII. Of the policie vsed by King Henry the eighth, and his Coun∣cell, in the expelling of the Popes authoritie out of his Dominions. THus you haue seene the abrogation and extinguishment of the Popes vsurped authoritie here in England, & the establishment of that power in the Crowne imperiall, which was not rashly attempted by his Maiestie; but vndertaken vpon mature deliberation, and proceeded in, by the aduise, consultation, and iudgement of the most great and famous Clerkes in Chri∣stendome: amongst which number, was that pure Orator and learned di∣uine Philip Melanchton ; whose presence here in England (after his opi¦nion) the king much desired; as by this letter following, sent to Secretarie Cromwell from the Duke of Norfolke, and Viscount Rocheford ap∣peareth. Master Secretary after our most harty commendacions, ye shall vnder∣stand that hauing receyued the letters sent vnto yow from Sir Iohn Wallop, and shewed the same vnto the Kings Maiestie, his pleasure therevpon was that we should dispatch these owr letters incontynently vnto youe con¦cernyng thaccomplishment and doing of these things ensuing. First, his graces pleasure is that youe shall immediatly vpon the receipt hereof, dis∣patch Barnes in Post with Deryk in his company into Germany, comman¦ding him to vse such diligence in his iournay, that he may, and it be possi∣ble, mete with Melanchton, before his arryuall in France, and in case he shall so mete with him, not onely to disuade his going thither, declaring how extremely the French king doth persecute all those that will not grant vn∣to the Bishop of Romes vsurped power, and iurisdiction; vsyng in this parte all persuasions, reasons, and meanes that he canne deuise, to empeach, and let his said iornay thither, layeng vnto him how moche it shuld be to his shame, and reproche, to vary and goo nowe from that true opinnion where∣in he hath so long continued. But also on thother side to persuade him all that he may to conuert his said iournay hither, shewing aswell the confor∣mity of his opinnion and doctrine here, as the nobilitie and vertues of the Kings Maiestie, with the good entretaynement which no doubt he shall haue here at his grace hand. And if percase the said Barnes shall not meet with him before his arriuall in France; thenne the said Barnes proceding himselfe forth in his Iournay towards the Prynces of Germany, shall with all diligence returne in post to the Kings highness the said Derik, with the advertisement of the certainty of Melanchtons commyng into France, and such other occurrants as he shall then knowe. And if the said Derik be not now redy to go with him, the Kings pleasure is, you shall in his stede ap∣point and sende suche onn other with the said Barnes, as you shall thinke mete for that purpose. And when the said Barnes shall arriue with the said Princes of Germa∣ny, the Kings pleasure is, he shall on his grace behaulfe aswell persuade them to persist and continue in their former good opinion concerning the denyall of the Bishop of Romes vsurped authoritie, declaring their owne honor, reputacion, and surety to depend thereon, and that they nowe may better mayntain their said iust opinion therein then euer they might, having the kings Maiestie, oon of the moost noble and puissant Princes of the world, of like opinion and iudgement with them, who, having proceeded therein by great aduise, deliberacion, consultacion, and iudgement of the most parte of the greate and famous Clerkes in Christendome, will in no wise relent, vary, or alter in that behalfe, as the said Barnes may declare and shew vnto them, by a booke made by the Deane of the Chappell, and as many of the Bishops Sermons as ye haue, whiche booke ye shall receyue herwith, the copies wherof, and of the said Sermons, ye must deliuer vnto the said Barnes at his departure, for his better remembrance and instructi∣on. To whom also his graces pleasure is, ye shall shew as moche of Sir Iohn Wallops letter which we send you also again, as ye shall see drawne and merkt with a penne in the mergent of the same. As also exhorte and moue them in any wise to beware howe they commyt any of their affayres to thorder, direction, or determinacion of the French King, consideryng he and his counsail be altogether Papist, and addict and bent to the mayn∣tenance and confirmacion of the Bishop of Romes pretended authoritie. Furthermore the Kings pleasure is, ye shall vpon the receipt herof imme∣diatly cause Master Haynes and Christofer Mount in post to repaire into France to Sir Iohn Wallop, in as secrete maner as they canne, as cummyng like his friends to visite him, and not as sent by the King. And in case they shall by him or otherwise lerne and knowe that Melanchton is there arry∣ued, then his grace wold that the said Haynes and Mount shall, in such sort as they be not moche noted, resorte vnto him, and for the disuading of his continuance there, or alteration of his opinion, and alluring of him hither, to vse suche reasons and persuasions as be before written, with suche other as they can further deuise for that purpose. To the which Haynes and Mount the Kings pleasure is, ye shall deliuer like copies of the said Deanes booke, and Bishops Sermons to be shewed vnto the said Melanchton, or otherwise vsed, as may be most expedient for thachyeuement of the Kings purpose in that behaulfe. Ye shall also vnderstande that the kings pleasure is, ye shall write to Sir Iohn Wallop, and send vnto him therwith like copies; willing him in case he shall haue certain knowledge that tharticles be true written in these his let∣ters concernyng the French Kings sending into Germany, for the continu∣ance of the Bishop of Romes pretended supremacie, to repaire with the said copies to the French King, and not only to set the same furth with such reasons as he can deuise in that part, shewing how moche it shalbe against his honour, both to geue himselfe subiect to the said Bishop, and moue other to doo the semblable, but also to declare vnto him, that the Kings highnes remembring his old frendly promises concernyng the mayntenance of his cause, and of his procedyngs touching the same, cannot thinke it a litle strange that the said French King (seing his Maiestie hath in his doings touching the said Bishop of Rome, moued neyther his nor any Princes subiects) will m ue and styr the Germayns to condescende vpon a contrary opinion, both to themselfs, and to his grace in this behalfe; And that his Maiestie must nedes thinke this Amytie moche touched in that he shuld moue any state or cuntrie to doo that thing, whiche is so moche against the Kings highnes and his owne promes, vsing all the waies to di∣suade him from the dishonorable obedience of the said Bishops See, mouing him to inclyne to the Kings iust opinion touching the same. Finally the Kings pleasure is, ye shall write an other letter to the Bishop of Aberden, signifying that the Kings Maiestie taketh it very vnkindly that the King his Nephieu wold now embrace without his aduise or counsail, being his derest frend and Vncle, and now in liege and Amytie with him, the mariage of Mounsieur de vandous daughter, wherevnto he wold geue non eare at his graces ouerture hertofore made of the same. In your seid let∣ter imputing a great negligence therein to the said Bishop and other of his Masters counsail, seing their Master sheweth not in the doing therof suche amytie towards the Kings highnes, as the frendship betwene them doth re∣quire. And to make an end, his grace will in no wise that Barnes of Haynes shall tarry for any further instruction of the Bishop of Canterbury, or any other, his grace hauing determyned to sende the same after by Master Al∣moner and Heth : but that he, Master Haynes, and Mount shal with all possi∣ble diligence departe immediatly in post without lenger tarying thenne for this their depeche shal be necessary, soo as their abode empeche not the Kings purpose touching the said Melanchton. And thus fare youe most hartly well. From Langley in moche hast this Monday at iiii of the clocke at after none. Your louyng Frends, T. Norffolk. George Roc ford. Also, before the beginning of that Parliament wherin the Popes supreme authoritie here in England was abolished, these remarkable Inductions fol∣lowing were set downe, and commanded by the King and his Councell to be suddenly put in execution. First, to send for all the Bishops of this realme, and speciallie for suche as be nerest to the Courte, Out of the said Mss. in bib. Cot. and to examine them a parte, whether they by the law of God can proue and iustifie, that he that now is called the Pope of Rome is aboue the generall Counsaile, or the generall Counsail aboue him; Or whether he hath gyuen vnto him by the law of God any more auctority within the realme, then any other foreyn Bishop. Item, to deuise with all the Bishoppes of this realme, to set furth, preach, and cause to be preched to the Kings people, that the said Bishop of Rome called the Pope, is not in auctoryte aboue the generall Counsell, but the generall Counsell is aboue him and all Bishpos. And that he hathe not by Goddes law any more iurisdiction within this realme then an other forraine Bishop, being of any other realme hath. And that such auctority as he before this hath vsurped within this realme, is both against Gods law, and also against the generall Counsalles; Which vsurpation of aucto∣ritie onely hath growen to him by the sufferance of Prynces of this realme, and by none auctority from God. Item, therefore that order be taken for such as shall preach at Paules Crosse from henceforth, shall continually from Sonday to Sonday preach there, and also teach and declare to the people, that hee that now calleth himselfe Pope, nether any of his Predecessours is and were but onely the Bishops of Rome, and hath no more authoritie and iurisdiction by Gods law within this realme, then any other forraine Bishop hath, which is no∣thing at all. And that such authoritie as hee hath claimed heretofore hath been onely by vsurpation and sufferance of Princes of this realme. And that the Bishop of London may bee bound to suffer none other to preach at Paules Crosse, as hee will answer, but such as will preach and set forth the same. Item, that all the Bishops within this realme bee bound and ordered in the same wise, and cause the same to bee preached throughout all their Diocesses. Item, that a speciall practise be made, and a straight commandement gi∣uen to all Prouincialls, Ministers, and rulers of all the foure Orders of Fri∣ers within this realme, commanding them to cause the same to be preached by all the Preachers of their religions, and through the whole realme. Item, to practise with all the Friers Obseruants of this realme, and to command them to preach likewise; or else that they may be stayed, and no suffered to preach in no place of the realme. Item, that euery Abbot, Prior, and other heads of religious houses with∣in this realme, shall in like manner teach their Conuents and brethren, to teach and declare the same. Item, that euery Bishop shall make speciall commandements to euerie Parson, Vicar, and Curate within his Diocesse to preach and declare to his Parishoners in likewise. Item, Proclamations to be made throughout the realme containing the whole Act of Appeales; And that the same Act may bee impressed, transu∣med, and set vp on euery Church doore in England, to the intent that no Parson, Vicar, Curate, nor any other of the Kings subiects shall make them∣selues ignorant thereof. Item, the Kings prouocations and appellations made from the Bishop of Rome vnto the generall Councell, may also be transumed, impressed, pub∣lished and set vp on euery Church-doore in England, to the intent that if any censures should be fulminate against the king or his realme, that then it may appeare to all the world, that the censures be of none effect, consi∣dering that the king hath already, and also before any censures promulged, both prouoked and appealed. Item, like transumpts to bee made, and sent into all other realmes and dominions, and specially into Flanders, concerning the kings said prouo∣cations and appellations, to the intent falsehood, iniquitie, malice, and in∣iustice of the Bishop of Rome may thereby appeare to all the world. And also to the intent that all the world may know that the Kings highnes stan∣ding vnder those appeales, no censures can preuaile, neither take any effect against him and his realme. This could not well be done before the Parliament. Item, a letter to be conceiued from all the Nobles, as well Spirituall as Temporall of this Realme, vnto the Bishop of Rome, declaring the wrongs iniuries, and vsurpations vsed against the kings highnes and this realme. Item, to send exploratours and espies into Scotland, and to see and per∣ceiue their practises, and what they intend there; And whether they will confederate themselues with any other outward Princes. Item, to send letters for that purpose to the Earle of Northumberland, my Lord Daves, and Sir Thomas Clyfford. Item, certaine discreete and graue persons to bee appointed, to repaire into the parts of Germany, to practise and conclude some lege or amitie with the Princes and Potentates of Germany, that is to say, the King of Pole, Iohn of Hungary, the Duke of Saxony, the Duke of Bauyere, Duke Frede∣ricke, the Landegraue Van Hesse, the Bishop of Magous, Bishop of Treuers, the Bishop of Collene, and other the Potentates of Germany, and also to ensearch of what inclination the said Princes and Potentates be of towards the King and this realme. Item, like practise to be made and practised with the Cities of Lubeke, Danske, Hambourgh, Bromeswicke, and all other the steads of the Haunse Tu onyk; and to ensearch of what inclination they bee towards the King and this realme. Item, like practise to be made and practised with the Cities of Norim∣bourgh, and Aughsbrough. Item, to remember the Merchants aduenturers, haunting the dominions of Braband, and to speake with them. Item, to set order and establishment of the Princes Dowagers house, with all celeritie, and also of my Lady Maryes house. To these (or some of these) purposes, the King dispatched messengers to all his Embassadours and Agents beyond seas, hauing before that sent the Duke of Norfolke, Viscount Rocheford, Sir William Pawlet (afterwards Marquesse of Winchester) and others, to the Pope, the Emperour, and the French King, being all three together at Nice. He also caused his Secretarie to write in this manner to Iames the fifth, King of Scotland. Moste excellent, In predict. bib. Cot. myghtye and victorious Prynce, Ple s th your Magestie that by the commaundment of my most dread Lord and Soueraigne Kyng of England, your graces moste dere Vncle, I haue in charge, vndre com∣myssion, certeyn specyall maters concernyng his highnes pleasure, secreat∣ly to be signyfyed vnto your grace, wherein not only as a naturall Cousyne of your royall consanguinity; but as a moste loueing Father entierly ten∣dryng your worthye honor, no lesse desirous hereof, then regardyng his owne peculyer prosperyte, vnfaynedly accomptyng your graces aduance∣ment his moste conformable consolacion. In consideracyon whereof sith it hath so pleasyd God of his infynyte fauour to revele vnto his highnes as well by studyous endeuor of good letters, as by erudyte consultacyon of famous estemyde Clerke; Also by long attempted experience, ensearchyng truyth chyeflye in Christs doctryne, who, saith Iohn the fourteenth, Ego sum veritas : now clerely to perceive the thrall, captyvyte, vndre the vsur∣pyd power of the Busshop of Rome, and his vngodly lawes. Wherein his highnes and other many of his noble progenitors were moste wyckedly abusyde, to their intollerable calamity; and excedyng molestacion of their Subiects, ouer whom God had yeuon them auctoryte and gouernaunce to rule, as by all storyes of the olde testament, and informacyon of the new playnely apperith. Which groundly knowen to his highnes, wisshith lyke∣wise, the same to be persuadyd vnto your grace; wherby your honorable renoune and royall auctoryte shuld be moche enlargyd, with no lesse fely∣citye of soule, pryncipally to be regardyd, then with aboundant comoditie of riches, and vnfayned obeysaunce of faythfull Subiects, ferr from the comeberous calamyte of the Popysshe myserable molestacyon. What more intollerable calamyte may ther be to a Christian Prynce, than vniustlye to be defeatyd of his righteous iurisdiction within his realme? to be a King by name, and not indede, to be a ruler without regyment ouer his owne liege people? what more greuous molestacion can chaunce to true harted Sub∣iects, than to be seuer d from the alliegiaunce due to their naturall Soue∣raigne, ther annoyntyd King grauntyd by Gods lawes, and to become ser∣vile slaues to a foreyn Potentat, vsurpyng to reigne ouer them agaynste the lawe of God? as by the violent tyrannye of the Bushop of Rome hathe many yeres hitherto bene practysed throughout all regions, to the ruynous desolacyon of the hole Christentie? what Realme is ther but that the Bus shop of Rome hath planted therein his kingdome? and established his regi∣ment after soche a subtiell way, that he and his cra tye creatures were obeyd of Prynces, to whome of dutye they ought to haue bene subiect: 1. Pet. 2. siue Regi tanquam praecellenti, &c. of whome all Romayn Busshops haue presumyd to be successors, but not folowers, contrarye to his example, Qui non venit ministrari, sed ministrare. In all Realmes the Popisshe practise hath had soche confederacye of false forsworne factious and trayterous Taleb rers. Titinylks vntrue to ther Soueraigne, that nothyng was so secreatly in counsaill of any Prynce, but forthwith it was caried by relacion to the Popes care. And if ought were attemptyd agaynste his owne person, or any crookyd creature of his creation, in restraynyng of ther extortionate claymes (as ther was nothyng but they claymed to haue auctoryte vpon) incontynent they bouncyd out their thunderbolts, and currsyng fulmina∣tions, with soche intollerable force of vnmercyfull crudelyte, that they made the greatiste personages of the world to trymble and quake for feare. For by the negligente soufferaunce of Prynces, thrughe d faute of know∣lege of Goddes worde the Popisshe pride was so haught, his auctoryte so preemynent, his power so puisaunte, his strengthe so myghtye, his displea∣sure so daungerous, his Tyrrannye so terrible; that scarse any durst resiste; to coutrevaill none was able. Example of many excellente Prynces; as Iohn the furst, and Henry the second of gracyous memory, Kings of Eng∣land, here in their liffe times moste cruelly vexyd, and after there disseas, by forged leasyngs, and slaunderous ympechements mysreportyd, and faulse∣lye belied, with dispitfull dishonor of ther excellent progenye. After like fasshion the victorious Emperor Lodovicus enterprysing to interrupte the pestilente peruersyte of Pope Iohn the two and twentieth, to what carefull confusion was he brought? Moreouer the godly and well disposed Henry the third, Emperour of Allmayn, how traytterouslye was he betrayed by Pope Hildebrande, procuryng his owne son vnnaturally to war agaynst his Father, to take him prisoner, and fynally to depose him of his Empereall crowne? Furthermore, what Christian hart can refrayn from sorrofull sighes, and morening lamentation to considre how the Innocent and harm∣les Prynce Childevicus King of France, was extremely handelyd of his owne servant Pepyne, beryved of his Kyngdome through the instigacion of the Busshop of Rome. And no marvaill though he ha thus encroched vpon Prynces, being men; wheras he hath exalted hymself agaynst God, thrustyng him out of his roome, and setlyng hymself in Gods place, the con∣science of Christian people, of whose vsurped power, S. Paul prophecyeng, Thessall. 2. chap. 2. callyth him the sinfull man, the sonn of perdicion, qui est aduersarius & effertur adversus omne quod dicitur Deus, adeo vt in templo Dei sedeat. Doth not he sytt in the temple of God, by dampnable dispensacions, by dysceyvable remyssions, by lyenge myrracles, by fayned reliques, by false religion, &c. And as he hath avoyded God out of the con∣scyence of Christian people, so hath he defeated Prynces of ther iurisdicti∣ons, and debarred euery commen weale from ther politick gouernaunce, bringyng in his lawlesse Canons, and detestable decrees, supplantyng the devyne ordynaunce of power yeuen to Pryncely rulers. And the cause why they haue bene so decey ed, S. Paul declaryth, Eo quod dilectionem veritatis non acceperunt. This legally consideryd of your moste prudent, singuler, and high politike discretion, aswell by probable experience with∣in your Domynyons, as by euident examples of other Christian regions, wher the Popisshe vnruly regiment hath raigned with intollerable vsurpa∣cion, tyrannouslye defacing all power of Prynces. It may please your gracious benygnytie to aduertice the entier intent, the louyng mynd, and vnfayned hart of my Soueraigne, your most dere vncle, so fervently moued with a faithfull loue, vnable to be expressed, to allure your graces affection toward the fauourable embracement of Gods worde; wherein, his highnes onlye reioysinge, ardently desyreth to imparte the same, his speciall ioye, with your most excellent grace, which shuld be greatly thadvauncement of your estate royall, the quietacion of your lo∣uing Subiects, and most highlie the pleasure of God. Now to make the Pope more odious, his Kinglie power, and deliberate proceedings in these his weightie causes of greater validitie, and more war∣rantable, as well by the lawes of God, as generall Councells; he caused to be pend, and published abroad, here, and beyond seas, to the same effect in these words. If mortall creatures to theyr hedds, Ex eod. M ss. in bib. Cot. soueraignes, and naturell Princes, be cheeflye bounde next vnto God, specially where they as moste carefull fa∣thers and Tutors, prudently and sagely rule and gouern the great numbers and multitudes of men, commytted to theyr obedyence; And where they in their royall persons often forgetting the regard of theyr Princely mage∣sties, valyantly withstand, abyde and resist, whatsoeuer troubles, daungers, perells, assawts, wrongs, iniuryes, or displeasures myght at any tyme hap∣pen, chaunce, threten, or be incident vnto theyr people, or countries, be∣syds many and innumerable other displeasures and troubles, which dailie and heurely for the defence mayntenaunce and supportacion of theyr realmes, people and cuntryes, secretly happen, and chaunce them, theyr people seldome, or at no time pryvey thervnto; wherby of good congru∣ence, all Subiects become most bounden to theyr soueraignes and Prynces, and them ought most feithfully to loue, honour, obeye, serue and dreade, and theyr magesties to mayntayn, support, and defend with all theyr powre, myghte, strength, and habilitie. Then let no Englyssheman for∣gett the most noble and louyng Prynce of this realme, who for the godly ensample of his people, the loue and dread he hath to God, and obseruance of his most reuerend lawes, hathe to the evydent knowlege of all his welbe∣louyd Subiects long endured and abyden, to his inestimable coste, charge, trouble, vexation, and inquye nes, Which was the diu rce betwixt him and his wife Katherine. the triall of his great cause: And at last after innumerable most famous learned mens iudgements on his syde therin gyuen. Yet for all that most wrongfully iudged by the great Idoll and most cruell enymye to Christs law and his religion, which calleth him∣selfe Pope, And his most iust and lawfull prouocacion and appellacion from the sayd enemye of Christs law to the generall counsail made, also re∣fused, denyed, and forsaken; Wherfore and to thintente all men may know the abhominable wrongs, which our most noble and gracious Prynce doth susteyne by so vnlawfull intreatyngs, Therfore are these few articles here∣after following presented vnto those, that shall both desyre to knowe the truth, and in truth shall thyrste and couet feythfully to assyst, maynteyn, supporte, defende, and stand by theyr Prynce and Souerayn, in his most iust, lawfull, and right wise cause. First that the generall Counsail lawfully gathered is and ought to be su∣periour to all Iurisdictions, either vsurped and suffred (as the Papall) or iustly holden as kings in all matters concernyng the feythe and direction of the whole Churche of Christe. And also ought to be iudged thereby, and by the decrees of the same only, and by none other, they being consonant to the law of Christe. Secondly, that Prynces have two wayes principally; when none other can prevayle to attaine right thone against thother; that is to say, in cawses concernyng the sowle beyng mere spirituell, appellacion to the generall counsail In temporall cawses the sword only, except by mediation of frends the matters may be compounded; So that whosoeuer wolde go about to take away these naturell defenses from Prynces, is to be manly withstood, both by the Princes and their Subiects. And therto all Christien men shuld be anymated by the words of our Lord Iesu Christe, which are, Obey ye Prynces aboue all; and then theyr deputyes or mynysters, not gevyng powre to forreyns wythin theyr rules and domynyons. Thirdly, that dyuers generall Counsaills haue determyned, that cawses of strife or controuersie beyng ones begonne in any Regyon, shall there, and in the sayd Regyon be finally determyned, and not elsewhere. Vpon which grounde the Kings highnes, his nobles, both spirituell and tempo∣rall, and Commons by one hole consent, vpon diuers most prudent, wyse, and polytike reasons, and weyghty consideracions, agreable to the seyd ge∣nerall Counsaills, haue made a Law, by the which good people, lyving within the lymets of true and lawfull matrymonye, shall not by malice or evill will be so long deteyned and interrupted from their ryght, as in tymes passyd they haue byn. Neither vnlawfull matrymonye shall haue his in∣iust and incestuous demoure and contynuance, as by delayes to Rome it was wont to haue; Which now may evydently appere, by that, that our Prynces weyghtye and long protracted cause of matrymonye hath his finall and prosperous end, accordyng to the lawes of God, with briefe suc∣cesse of Issue alredy had, and other like to follow, lawdes be to God, thonly werker of the same. Forthely, that our sayd Prynce and Soueraigne, accordyng to the liber∣tie and lawes of Nature, and constitucions of generall Counsaills (as afore) hath both prouoked and appeled from the most iniust and vnlawfull sen∣tence wrongfully geuen against him, by the Bushop of Rome, to the gene∣rall Counsaill next ensying, and lawfully congregate, that is to say, from the sentence of the vsurper of Goddes lawes, and infringer of generall Counsells, which callyth himselfe Pope. In the which our sayd Prynces doyings, all iust and true Christien men, specyally his most louyng Sub∣iects I doubt not will supporte and maynteyne him: Which prouocacions and appellacions also standyng in force, and beyng intimate to the person of the said Vsurper (as indede they be) and by him denyde and refused, se∣questreth him rightfully from all maner of Processes belongyng, or in any wyse apperteynyng to the sayd fact or matter; other Diabolike acts and statuts by some of his predecessors to the contrary made notwithstandyng. Wherfore what censures, interdictions, or other his cursed invencions so euer they be, fulminate or set forthe by the sayd vsurper, the same ought not only to be abhorred and despysed, but manfully to be withstood and defended. And who so doen shall haue for theyr bukler the latter and better parte of this verse ensuyng, and the maligners the forparte, which is, Quo∣niam qui malignant exterminabuntur, sustinentes autem Domini ipsi here∣dita unt terram. Fyftely, that where indede by holy Scripture and Christs lawe, there is none authoryte nor Iurisdiction graunted more to the Bushop of Rome, then to any other Bushop, extra Prouinciam, yet because that sufferaunce of people, and blyndnes of Prynces with theyr supportacion hetherto hath susteyned the same, doyng themselffs thereby to great iniurye and wrong; It is now thought therfore not only conuenyent, but also moche more then necessarye, to open the same vnto the people, to thyntent they shulde from henceforth no longer be disteyned in honouryng him as an Idoll; which is but a man vsurpyng Goddes powre and auctoryte: And a man neither in life, learnyng, or conuersacion like Christs minister or disci∣ple: yea a man also (though the See Apostolike were neuer of so high au∣ctoryte) vnworthy and vnlawfull by theyr owen decrees and lawes to oc∣cupye and enioy that vsurped place. For first he is both base, and also come to that dygnytie by Symonye. And now by denying the Kings lawfull prouocacion and appele, and in supportyng that Diabolike decree of his predecessor Pius, is determyned by a generall Counsaill a very Heretike. Wherfor all true Christien people (except he amend) ought to despise both him and all his facts, and be no lenger blynded by him; but geue themselffs entierly to the obseruaunce of Christes lawes, in which is all swetenes and truthe; and in the other nothing else but pompe, pride, ambycion, and wayes to make himselfe riche: which is moche contrarious to theyr pro∣fession. Our Lord amend them. Likewise such was the wisedome of the King and his Councell, that the best schollers of the kingdome, as well verst in historie humane, as in the storie of sacred Writ, were appointed to collect out of holy Scripture, Ca∣tholike Authours, and generall Councells, such materiall points, as might annihilate the Popes power and authoritie, confirme his Maiesties Supre∣macy; and delineate and set forth the manifold abuses found to be practi∣sed by the Popish Clergie.

These Heads or Chapters are all succinctly handled, glossed vpon, and illustrated by diuers examples, which are too long (though perhaps they would not seeme tedious) for this my present discourse; I will onely then insist vpon the last, the foundation I meane of Saint Albans, by Ossa King of the Mercians; for that by this Donation, the Supremacie of Kings is ve∣ry apparent; and also that once for all I may by this one, shew my Reader the forme of all those Cartularies, by which such deuout Saxon Princes endowed their sacred Structures.

It was generally conceiued (and truly as I thinke) that these politike wayes for the taking away from the Pope his vnlimited authoritie here in England, as also in the suppression of religious houses (of which in the next Chapter) were principally deuised by Secretarie Cromwell, afterwards Earle of Essex, which may appeare both by the premises and sequele of this my discourse, as also by the intimation of Nicholas Shaxton Bishop of Sa∣rum, in a letter sent vnto him the said Cromwell, thus worded. Honorable syr I certifie your good mastership that I haue this daye re∣ceyued the Kyng his most honorable letters sent vnto me from you by my servant, Ex eod. lib. in bib. Cottoniana. And reioyse nott a litle that itt hath pleased his highnes to write so ernestly vnto the Bishopps in this so ernest a cause, thynkyng suyrly that God hath vsed your wisdom to stire vp the good Prynce herevnto, whereof I heighli thanke the almighti Lord; preyeng you also to goo on still from one thyng to another, as your wisdom, yea Gods veray wisdom in you ex∣citeth and serueth you, till the vsurped poure of that man of Rome be clene abolished; and put out of the hartes of the kyngs subiects. And I shall with all my diligence applie my self to thaccomplishment of this his so godly commandement by Goddes grace. And for as moche as I haue taken my leue of the Kyng and Quene, and tarry for noothing now but only for the instrument called Custodias temporalium. I eftsones beseche your ma∣stirship to haue that in your remembraunce whan ye shall next repaire vnto the Court, together with a discharge for takyng of any othe of the resi∣dentiaries of Sarum, which suyrly they will exact of me, oneles I bryng some thyng outher from the Kyng his highnes, or elles from you his chefe Counsellor for to stopp their mouthes. And as for seallyng of new obli∣gacions if itt like you to commande your servaunt to send me them to mo∣row by this brynger, I shall seale them and send them to you, without any tariaunce, by the grace of God: who preserue you and prosper you in all your godly purposes and interprises. Murtelack the iiii daye of Iuin. Yorn owne to comaunde Nic. Sarum. But howsoeuer the honour of this act, as also of the dissolution of Ab∣beys be principally attributed to Cromwell and his complotments; yet at the same time there was others of the priuie Councell, as forward, and as able for their singular endowments, to conclude a matter of that conse∣quence as euer was Cromwell. I meane Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, whose zeale and abilities are generally knowne to all that euer heard of the booke of Martyrs. Sir Thomas Audley Knight, speaker of the Parliament, for his demerits created by Henry the eighth, Baron Audley of Walden, and also aduanced to the honour of the Chancellorship of Eng∣land. Sir William Pawlet Knight, Comptroller of the Kings house, who, for his wisedome, the said King created Lord S. Iohn of Basing, and Knight of the Garter, whom Edward the sixt made great Master of his houshold, President of his Councell, and Lord Treasurer of England; whom he crea∣ted Earle of Wiltshire, and Marquesse of Winchester; to whom Queene Elizabeth committed the keeping of the great Seale. Who liued to see one hundred and three persons issue out of his loynes, who died at Basing in Hampshire the tenth of March, 1571. where hee was honourablie buried, when he had liued eightie seuen yeares. Another pillar of the State at that time, was that wise and iudicious gentleman▪ Sir Richard Rich, Lord Chan∣cellour of England, vnder King Edward the sixth, who in the first yeare of his raigne, aduanced him to this office, and created him Baron Rich of Leez in Essex. These and other more of the Nobilitie had both their hands and heads in this businesse, yet Cromwell, Audley, and Rich, were thought to be the onely men; who, for their religious paines, ranne into great oblo∣quie with the common people; insomuch that the Commons of Lincoln∣shire finding themselues fore troubled with this strange alteration, and ri∣sing in rebellion, presented diuers articles of aggrieuances to the Kings Maiestie▪ Amongst the said Articles and demands of Robert Ask , and his rebel∣lious crew, the Commons of Yorkeshire, Cumberland, Westmerland, Nor∣thumberland, and the countries adiacent▪ at the conference holden at Don∣caster, betwixt Thomas Duke of Norfolke, Generall of the Kings Armie, and certaine Commissioners on the partie of the said Captaine Aske, and his fellow rebels. Thus it was propounded by their Speaker, Sir Thomas Hyl∣ton Knight. The fowrt that Thomas Cromwell, nor any of his bande or secte, be not at our metinge at Doncastre, but abcent themselfe from the Councell. Also to haue the Lord Cromwell, the Lord Chancellor, and Sir Ryc. Rich to haue condigne punyshment, as subuerters of the gud lawes of the eame, and ouetemers of the slese secte of theys fals Heretykes, first inuenters and brengers of them. Likewise Doctor Leyton, and Doctor Le , who had bene loyned in com∣mission with Cromwell for the visitation of religious Foundations (of which hereafter) were maliciouslye detracted, by this demand of the Commons in the foresaid conference. Also that Doctor Lee, and Doctor Leyton, may haue condigne punysh∣ment for theyr extortions, in time of visitation, in brybes, of some religy∣ous houses, x. lib. xx. lib. and for other summes, besyde horsys, vowsens, leases, vndre Couent Seallys, by them taken, and other abomynable acts by them committed and done. I might haue occasion here to speake of the abrogation of the Popes au∣thoritie, of the subuersion of religious foundations, of the suppression of re∣ligious Votaries, and of the reformation of Religion in that neuer-conque∣red Nation of Scotland, where, at this time, Religion is double refined, pure and spotlesse without ceremonie, and plaine as a pike staffe without a sur∣plise. But I will reserue this narration till I come to speake of the conuersion of Scotland to the Christian faith. As also of the Funerall Monuments which are there to be found, which will be but a few, if Sir Robert Cottons Librarie do not helpe me, for by my owne obseruation, in the famous mai∣den-citie of Edenborough, and in the Parish Churches of other Townes, the Sepulchres of the dead are shamefully abused, or quite taken away, yea and the Churches themselues, with religious houses, and other holy places, violated, demolished, or defaced. CHAP. XV. The policie vsed by the King and his Councell for the dissolution and extirpation of Religious Foundations, and Religious Orders, with∣in this Realme of England and Wales. The reformation of Religion. of Inscriptions in Churches. The Kings warrant of the surrender of Religious Houses. An information made to Queene Elizabeth of the seuerall abuses done vnto the State generall, and Crowne, by the corruption of such as were imployed by her Father vpon the suppression of Abbeyes. HEnry the eighth hauing (as ye haue heard) thus setled the Suprema∣cy where he would haue it, either by the aduise of politick Cromwell, or by the example of proud Wolsey, or else of himselfe (hee being nothing so scrupulous in conscience, nor so stayed in sacred resolutions as was Hen∣ry the fourth) vpon a greedie desire to enrich his coffers, began now to lay plots, deuises, and proiects for the vtter subuersion of all Abbeyes, Priories, Nunneries, and other religious foundations; within this his kingdome of England and Wales: and first for an induction to the businesse, He put in Commission his seruant Cromwell, Thomas Lee, and Richard Laiton, Do∣ctors of the Ciuill Law, Thomas Bedell, Deane of Cornwall, Thomas Bart∣let publike Notarie, and others, to visit all the foresaid religious Houses, and to make inquirie of their Orders, Founders, values, debenters, reliques, pilgrimages, and other Queres: but most especially they were to make dili∣gent scrutinie, and to learne, vijs & modis omnibus, by all manner of meanes the wicked abuses of those times, practised amongst the Fraternitie, and Si∣sterhood of each seuerall Couent. Which with their Commission they re∣turned; making a shamefull discoueri of the bestiall sensualitie of Mona∣sticke profession. This generall visitation began in the moneth of October, and in Febru∣arie next following, a Parliament vpon prorogation was holden at West∣minster, in which these vnspeakable crimes of all the Couents were certi∣fied by the Commissioners to the King, and that high Court. Vpon the reading whereof, because their offences were found to be many and odious, or that King Henry would haue it so (which I rather beleeue) it was en∣acted by both houses in that present Parliament, Stat. in 27. Hen. 8. ca. 28. that all religious houses of and vnder the yearely value of two hundred pound, within the whole Realme of England and Wales, should be giuen and granted to the King and his heires for euer: with all and singuler the lands, tenements, rents, reuersions, goods, cattels, debts, ornaments and iewels, with all things else thereunto, or to their Orders, in any wise appertaining or belonging. The number of these houses then suppressed, were three hundred seuenty sixe. The value of their lands, yearely as then easily rated, was twentie nine thousand fourtie one pounds three pence halfe penie qua: others, for thirtie two thousand pound, and more, the moueable goods as they were sold, Robin Hoods peniworths, amounted to more then one hundred thou∣sand pounds, the religious persons that were put out of the same houses, were in number aboue ten thousand. It was a pitifull thing to here the lamentation that the people in the countrey made for them, for there was great hospitalitie kept among them, and as it was thought more then ten thousand persons, masters, and ser∣uants, had lost their liuings, by the putting downe of those houses at that time. Before the dissolution of these religious houses, the plot was laid for the suppression of the rest. For first of all, for an introduction to that which fol∣lowed, Cromwell and the rest of the Visiters, in their visitations, put forth of their Couents all religious persons, that desired to be eased of the bur∣denous yoke of their profession, to whom the Abbot or Prior was to giue to such so departed for their habit, a Priests gowne, and fourty shillings of money. The Nunnes to haue such apparell as secular women wore, and to go whither they would. They put forth likewise all religious persons that were vnder the age of foure and twenty yeares, and afterwards closed vp the residue that would remaine, so, that they could not come out of their places; and tooke order that no man should come to the houses of women, nor women to the houses of men, but onely to heare their seruice in the Church. This little bondage, after so long and so licentious a time of liber∣tie, could not be endured; which being perceiued by the Commissioners, with faire promises of other preferments, or competent yearely pensions, they so wrought with the Abbots, Priors, and Prioresses, and the rest of the Couents, that diuers of them surrendred vp their houses with the appur∣tenances into the Kings hands, before the sitting of this Parliament, as by these words in the foresaid Act doth plainly appeare. And also be it enacted, that his Highnes shall haue to him and his heires all and singular such Monasteries, Abbies, and Priories, which at any time within on yeare next before the making of this Act, hath beene giuen and granted, by any Abbot, Prior, Abbesse, or Prioresse, vnder their Couent Seale, or that otherwise hath beene suppressed or dissolued, and all and sin gular the lands, tenements, goods, &c. interests and hereditaments, &c. to the same appertaining and belonging. Now (by the example of these, or by what other meanes I know not) the rest of the Abbots, Priors, Abbesses, and Prioresses, at other times, with vnanimous consent of their Couents, in great compunction of spirit, con∣trition of heart, and confession of their manifold enormities, did seuerally giue and grant to the Kings Maiestie, and to his heires, all their right and interest which they had in their Monasteries, lands, goods, or heredita∣ments; by certaine instruments or writings vnder their hands and S ales, of which I will set downe one or two for example, which I had from my louing friend, Master Iohn Masters, Master of the Augmentation Office; in forme as followeth. But first will it please you reade the copie of the Kings Warrant, to such his Commissioners as were to take the Surrenders of Religious houses. The forme of which thus followeth. Henry the eighth, &c. To our trustie, &c. Forasmuche as we vnderstand that the Monastery of S. A. is at this pre∣sente in such state, as the same is neither vsed to the glory of God, nor to the benefyte of our Comon welth, We let you wit, that therfore being mynd∣ed to take the same into our owne hands for a better purpose; like as we doubt not but the head of the same wilbe contented to make his surrender accordingly, we for the spesyall truste and confydence that we haue in your fydellity, wisdomes and discrecions, haue, and by these presents, doo au∣thoryse, name, assygne, and appoynte you, that immediatly repayring to the sayd Howse, ye shall receave of the sayd Head such a wryting vnder the Couent Seale, as to your discretyons shall seeme requisite, meete, and con∣uenient, for the due surrender to our vse of the same, and thervpon take pos sessyon therof, and of all the goodes cattelles plate, fuel es, implements and stuffe, being within, or apperteyneng thervnto. And forther causyng all the goodes and implements to be indisterently sold, either for reddy mo∣ney, or at dayes vpon suffyciente suertyes; so that the same day passe not one yere and a halfe. Ye shall deliuer to the said Head and Brethren, suche parte of the sayd money and goodes, as ye by your discresyons shall thinke meete and conuenyente for their despeche. And forther to see them haue convenyente pensyons, by your wysdomes assigned accordyngly: which done, and moreouer seeing the rightfull and due debts therof payd and sa∣tysfyed, as well of the revenewes as of the sayd stuffe, as to reason and good onscyens apperteyneth, and your charges reasonablie allowed, ye shall proceed to the dissolutyon of the sayd howse: And forther in your name take possessyon of the same to be kept to our vse and profyte. Ye shall fur∣thermore bringe and convaye to owr Tower of London after yowr sayd discressyons all the rest of the sayd money, Plate, Iuelles, and ornaments that in any wyse shall come to your hands by meane of the premysses, or of any parte therof. Straitely charging and commandynge all Maires, Sheryffes, Bayli s, Constables, and all other our Officers, Ministers, and Subiects, to whom in this case it shall apperteyne, that vnto you, and euery of you in exe ution herof, they be helpinge, aydinge, sauoring, and assisting, as they will answer vnto vs to the contrary at their vttermoste perrilles. Yeuen, &c. The resignation or surrender of the Prior and Couent of Saint Andrewes, Northampton: with a recognition of their manifold enormities. Most noble and vertuous Prince, owr most rightuous and gracyous So∣ueraign Lorde, and vndoubted Founder, and in erthe next vndre God Su∣preme heed of this Englyshe Churche. We yowr Gracys pore and most vnworthy Subiects, Francys, Priour of yowr Graces Monastery of Saint Andrew the Apostle, within yowr Graces Towne of Northampton, and the hoole Couent of the same, being steryd by the gryffe of owr consci∣ence, vnto greate contricion for the manifolde negligence, enormytes, and abuses, of long tyme by vs and other owr predecessours, vndre the pretence and shadow of perfyght Religion, vsyd and comytted, to the greuous dis∣pleasure of Almyghty God, the craftye decepcion, and subtell seduccion of the pure and symple myndys of the good Christian people of this yowr noble Reame, knowlegen owr selffes to haue greuously offendyd God, and yowr Highnesse owr Soueraign Lord and Founder. Aswell in corrupting the conscience of yowr good Christian subiects, with vayne, superstitious, and other vnprofitable ceremonyes, the very means and playn induccions to the abominable synne of Idolatry; as in omyttyng the execucion of suche deuowte and due observaunces, and charitable acts as we were boun den to do, by the promises, and avowe made by vs and our predecessors, vnto Almighty God, and to yowr graces most noble progeni ors, orygy∣nall Founders of yowr saide Monastery. For the which obseruances, and dedys of charyte, only yowr saide Monastery was indowed with son ry possessions, Iewels, ornaments, and other goods, moueable and vnmoue∣able, by yowr graces saide noble progenitors. The revenues of which pos∣sessions, we the saide Priour and Couent, voluntaryly onely by owr pr pre conscience compellyd, do recognyce, neither by vs, nor owr predecessors to haue ben emploied accordyng to the origynall intent of the Founders, of yowr saide Monastery; that is to saie, in the pure observaunce of Chrysts Religion, accordyng to the devowte rule, and doctryne, of holy Saint Be∣nedict, in vertuose exercyse, and study, accordyng to owr professyon and avowe; ne yett in the charytable sustayning, comforting, and releiving of the pore people, by the kepyng of good and necessary hospitality. But as well we as others owr predecessors, callyd religiouse persones within yowr said Monastery, taking on vs the habite or owtewarde vesture of the saide rule, onely to the intent to lead owr liffes in an ydell quyetnes, and not in vertuose exercyse, in a stately estymacion, and not in obedient humylyte, haue vndre the shadowe, or color of the saide Rule and habite, vaynly, de∣testably, and also vngodly, employed, yea rather deuowred, the yerely re∣uenues yssuing and comyng of the saide possessions, in contynuall ingurgi¦tacions and farcyngs of owr carayne bodyes, and of others, the support res of owr voluptuose and carnall appetyte, with other vayne and vngodly expensys; to the manyfest subvertion of deuocion, and clennes of lyvyng; and to the most notable slaunder of Chrysts holy Euangely, which in the forme of owr professyon, we dyd ostentate, and openly advaunte to kepe most exactly: withdrawing therby from the symple, and pure myndys of yowr graces subiects, the onely truth and comfort, which they oughte to haue by the true faith of Christe. And also the devyne honor, and glory, onely due to the glorious Maiestye of God Almyghty, steryng them with all persuasions, ingynes, and polyce, to dedd Images, and counterfett re∣liques, for owr dampnable lucre. Which our most horryble abhominaci∣ons, and execrable persuacions of yowr graces people, to detestable er∣rours, and our long coueryd Ipocrysie cloked with fayned sanctite; We re∣volving dayly, and continually ponderyng in owr sorowfull harts, and therby perseyuing the botomlas gulf of euerlastyng fyre redy to devowre vs, if persysting in this state of lyvyng, we shulde departe from this vncer∣tayn and transytory liffe; constrayned, by the intollerable anguysh of owr conscience, callyd as we trust by the grace of God, who wolde haue no man to perysh in synne: with harts most contrite, and repentante, prostrate at the noble feet of yowr most roiall Maiestye, most lamentably doo craue of yowr highnes, of yowr habundant mercy, to grant vnto vs, most gre∣uous agaynst God, and yowr highnes, yowr most gracious perdon, for owr saide sondry offences, omyssyons, and negligences, comytted as before by vs is confessyd, agaynst yowr hyghnes, and yowr most noble progeni∣tors. And where yowr hyghnes, being supreme hedd, immediately next aftre Christe, of his Church, in this yowr Roialme of England, so conse∣quently generall and only reformator of all religious persones, there, haue full authority to correcte or dyssolue at your graces pleasure, and libertye, all Couents and Relygious companyes abusyng the Rewles of their pro∣fession. And moreouer to yowr highnes, being owr soueraygn Lord, and vndoubted founder of yowr saide Monastery, by dissolucion whereof ap¦perteyneth onely the oryginall title, and propre inherytance, as well of all other goods moueable and vnmoueable, to the saide Monastery in any wyse apperteyning or belonging, to be dissposed, and imployed, as to yowr graces most excellent wysdome shall seme expedyent and necessary. All which possessyons, and goods, yowr highnes for our saide offences, abuses omys∣syons, and neglygences, being to all men obedyent, and by vs playnly con∣fessed, now hath, and of long tyme past hath hadd, iust and lafull cawse, to resume into yowr graces hands and possessyon, at yowr graces pleasure. The resumption wherof, yowr highnes neverthelesse, licke a most naturall lovyng Prince, and clement gouernor, ouer vs yowr graces po e, and for owr offences, most vnworthy subiects, hath of long season differred, and yet doth, in hope and trust of owr voluntary reconciliacion and amendment, by yowr graces manyfolde, lovyng, and gentyll admonyshments, shewyd vnto vs by dyuerse and sondry meanys. We therfor consyderyng with owr selffes your graces exceedyng goodnes and mercy, extended at all tymes vnto vs, most miserable trespassers against God and yowr hyghnes; For a perfight declaracion of yowr vnfeyned contricion and repentance, felyng owr selffes very weeke, and vnable to obserue and performe owr aforesaid avowes and promyses, made by vs and owr predecessors, to God, and yowr graces noble progenitors; and to imploy the possessyons of yowr saide Monastery, accordyng to the fyrst will and intent of the oryginall Founders.

With the like petition and recognition of their seuerall delinquencies, the Prior and Couent of the White Friers Carmelites in Stanford, the bbo and Couent of our blessed Lady of Bidlesden, the Warden and brethren of the grey Friers of Couentrie, Bedford, and Alesbury, surrendred vp them houses into the kings hands. Battaile Abbey in Sussex, Martine Abbey in Surrey, Stra ford Abbey in Essex, Lewis in Suffex, Saint Austines in Canterbury, the new Abbey at the Tower hill, the Minories without Aldgate, the Nunnery at Clerken well: The Hospitall of Saint Thomas Akers, the Blacke-Friers, the White-Friers, the grey Friers, and the Charterhouse Monks in London, with the most, or all other, were surrendred after the same manner. In September the same yeare. Viz. An. 30. Hen. 8. by the speciall mo∣tion of great Cromwell, all the notable images, vnto the which were made any especiall pilgrimages, and offerings, as the images of our Lady of Wal∣singham, Ipswich, Worcester, the Lady of Wilsdon; the rood of Grace, of our Ladie of Boxley, and the image of the rood of Saint Sauiour at Ber∣mondsey, with all the rest, were brought vp to London, and burnt at Chel∣sey, at the commandement of the foresaid Cromwell, all the Iewels, and other rich offerings, to these, and to the Shrines, (which were all likewise taken away or beaten to peeces) of other Saints throughout both England and Wales, were brought into the Kings Treasurie. In the same yeare also the Abbey of Westminster was surrendred, being valued to dispend by the yeare three thousand foure hundred and seuenty pound, or by some 3977. l. 6. s. 4. d. ob. q. as in the Catalogue of religious houses; the Monkes being expelled, King Henry placed therein a Deane and Prebendaries, and made the last Abbot, whose name was Benson, the first Deane; in the time of Edward the sixth it was made a Bishops See, shortly after (the benefits of the Church being abridged) it came againe to a Deane and Prebends; Againe Queene Marie ordained there an Abbot and his Monkes, who continued not many yeares, but were againe cut off by Act of Parliament. And lastly Queene Elizabeth (that wonder of the world) made it a collegiate Church, or rather a Nursery for the Church, saith Norden, for there she ordained (to the glory of God, the propagation of true Religion and good literature) a Deane, twelue Prebendaries, an vpper master, and an Vsher for the Schoole, fourtie Schollers, called the Queenes or Kings Schollers, who (as they become worthie) are preferred to the Vniuersities, besides Ministers, Singers, and Organists; ten Quiri¦sters, and twelue well deseruing Souldiers. Thus you see the interchangea∣ble vicissitude of her foundacion, and if it had not beene for the reuerend regard they had of the Sepulchres, inauguration and vnction here of their famous Ancestors, these forenamed Kings (if I may ground my reason vp∣on the passages of those times) had taken her commings in, to haue inrich their owne coffers, despoiled her o her vnualuable wealth and ornaments, and battered downe to the ground her sacred Ed fice. The fifth of December n the soresaid yeare, the Abbey of Saint Al∣ba s was surrendred, by the Abbot and Monkes there, by deliuering the Couent Seale into the hands of Tho. Pope, D. Peter, Master Canendish, and others the Kings visiters. 13. Now all, or the most of all, the religious houses in England and Wales, being thus surrendred, the King summoned another Parliament at West minster; for howsoeuer these forenamed religious orders, and other more, of their owne free and voluntary mindes, good wills, and assents, without constra t oact on or compulsion (as are the words in the Statute) of any manner of person or persons, by due order of law, and by their sufficient writings of Record, vnder their Couent, and common Seales; had alreadie g uen, granted, and confirmed, renounced, left, and forsaken, all their reli∣gious h u s, with their lands, and all other the appurtenances to the same belonging vnto the King his heires and successors for euer. Yet it was thought necessarie by the King and his Councell, that these their o u ta ic donations should bee further ratified by authoritie of that high whereupon it was enacted, that all Monasteries, with their Scites, circuits and precincts; la ds, Lordships, and all oth r franchises, not onely those which were surrendred or dissolued, before the session of this Parliament, but also such as were to bee surrendred or dissolued hereafter, shou d bee vested, deemed, and adiudged to be in the very actuall and reall season, and possession of the King his heires and successors for euer. The religious Order of Saint Iohns of Ierusalem, whose chiefe mansion house was in the precincts of Clerkenwell Parish, within the Country of Middlesex, consisting of gentlemen and souldiers, of ancient families and high spirits, could by no means be brought in, to present to his Maiestie any of these puling petitions, and publike recognitions of their errors, thereby, like the rest, to giue a loafe, and beg a shiue, to turne themselues out of actu∣all possession, and lie at the Kings mercie for some poore yearely pension. But like sto fellowes stood out against any that thought to enrich them∣selues with their ample reuenues, vntill they were cast out of their glorious structures, and all other their estates, for these causes following alledged a gainst them in open Parliament; as appeares by the statute beginning thus. 2. The Lords Spirituall and Temporall, and the Commons of this pre∣sent Parliament assembled, hauing credible knowledge, that diuers and sun∣drie the kings subiects, called the Knights of the Rhodes, otherwise called Knights of Saint Iohns ; otherwise called Friers of the religion of S. Iohn of Ierusalem in England, and of a like house being in Ireland, abiding in the parties of beyond the sea, and hauing aswell out of this Realme, as out of Ireland, and other the Kings dominions, yearely great summes of mo∣ney for maintenance of their liuings, Haue vnnaturally, and contrary to the dutie of their alleageances sustained, and maintained, power and authoritie of the Bishop of Rome, lately vsed and within this Realme, and other the Kings dominions, and haue not onely adhered them∣selues to the said Bishop, being common enemy to the King our soueraigne Lord, and to this his Realme, vntruely vpholding, knowledging, and affir∣ming maliciously and traiterously, the same Bishop to bee supreme, and chiefe head of Christs Church, by Gods holy word. Entending thereby to subuert and ouerthrow the good and godly laws and statutes of this realme, for the abolishing, expulsing, and vtter extincting of the said vsurped power and authoritie: but also haue defamed and slandered as well the Kings Maiestie, as the Noblemen, Prelates, and other the Kings true and louing subiects of this Realme, for their good and godly proceeding in that behalfe. Vpon these causes and other considerations, it was enacted, That the Corporation of the said Religion, as well within this Realme, as within the Kings dominion, and Land of Ireland, should be vtterly dissolued, and void to all entents and purposes. And that Sir William Weston Knight, as then Prior, of the said Religion, of this Realme of England, should not be named or called from henceforth, Prior of Saint Iohns of Ierusalem in England, but by his proper name of William Weston Knight, without further addi∣tion touching the said Religion. And that likewise Sir Iohn Rauson knight, being then Prior of Kilmainam in Ireland, should not bee called or named from thenceforth, Prior of Kilmainam in Ireland, but onely by his proper name of Iohn Rauson, knight, without farther addition. And that none of the Brethren or Confriers of the said Religion within this Realme of Eng∣land, and Land of Ireland, should bee called Knights of the Rhodes, or knights of Saint Iohns, but by their owne proper Christian names, and surnames of their parents without any other additions. And furthermore it was enacted vnder a great penaltie, that they should not weare about their necks, in, or vpon any apparell of their bodies, any chaine with a Ierusalem Crosse, or any other signe marke, or token thereto fore vsed, and deuised, for the knowledge of the said Religion, and that they should not make any congregations, chapiters, or assemblies touching the same Religion, or maintaine, support, vse, or defend any liberties▪ franchi∣ses, or priuiledges, theretofore granted to the said Religion, by the autho∣ritie of the Bishop of Rome, or of the See of the same. Lastly, it was granted by the authoritie of the said Parliament, that the Kings Maiestie, his heires and successors, should haue and enioy their said mansion house in the Parish aforesaid, within the County of Midlesex; and also the Hospitall of Kilmainam in Ireland, with all their appurtenances for euer. Yet it was prouided by the said Act, that Sir William Weston and Sir Iohn Rauson Priors, as also some other of the Confriers, should haue a cer∣taine annuall pension during their liues, with some reasonable proportion of their owne proper goods. And this was done (saith the words in the sta∣tute) by the agreement and assent of the Kings most excellent goodnes. Sir William Weston had giuen vnto him one thousand pound of annuall rent or pension. Sir Iohn Rauson fiue hundred Markes. Clement West Con∣frier, two hundred pound. Thomas Pemberton, fourescore pound. Gyles Russell, one hundred pound. George Ailmer, one hundred pound. Iohn Sutton, two hundred pound. Edward Bellingham, an hundred pound. Ed∣ward Browne fifty pound. Edmund Husse, an hundred Markes. Ambrose Caue, an hundred Markes. Thomas Copledyke, fifty pound. Cuthbert Leigh∣ton, threescore pound. Richard Broke, an hundred Markes. Henry Poole two hundred Markes. William Tyrell, thirty pound. Iohn Rauson, Confrier, two hundred Markes. To Anthony Rogers, Oswald Massingberd, Iames Husse, Thomas Thornell, Nicholas Hopton, Philip Babington, Henry Gerard, Dunstan Nudegate, Ni∣cholas Lambert, and Dauid Gonson, being Confriers professed, and hauing no certaine liuing, was giuen ten pound a peece of yearely pension. And if any pro es ed in the said Religion were negligently forgotten, or omitted out of that present Act, for lacke of knowledge of their names; yet it was ordered by the same, that they should haue such honest, conuenient, and reasonable yearly pension, and portion of goods, as should please the Kings Maiestie to limit and appoint. And by the said Act Io n Mableston, Subprior of this Hospitall in Eng∣land; William Ermested Master of the Temple of London: Walter Lymsey, and Iohn Winter Chapleines; were authorized to receiue and enioy, during their natura l liues, all such mansion houses, stipends, and wages, in as large and ample manner, as euer they did before the sitting of that Parliament. What other pensions were giuen, or how much the value in money was of the yearely profits of these foure last remembred, I do not reade. But the annuities or pensions appointed to the said two knights, and the Confriers, amounted to the summe of two thousand eight hundred and seuenty pound the yeare, issuing out of the lands to this Hospitall appertaining. And I finde that at the very same time of the dissolution of this Fraternitie, certaine lusts and Tourneaments being holden at Westminster, wherein the chal∣lengers against all commers were, Sir Iohn Dudley, Sir Thomas Seymor, Sir Thomas Poinings, Sir George Carew, knights, Antony Kingston, and Richard Cromwell, Esquires. To each one of which, for a reward of their valiant∣nesse; the King gaue an hundred Markes of yearely reuenues, and an house to dwell in, and both of them, to them and their heires for euer, out of the lands and liuings belonging to this Hospitall. Of such a large extensure were her possessions. And much what after this manner, the rest of the Manors, honors, lands, tenements, rents, and reuersions, were bestowed; and like∣wise at that time vpon small considerations, the scite and lands of all other Monasteries were begged, bought, and alienated by such who respected their owne profit aboue the seruice of Almighty God. Albeit it was then declared, saith Camden, that such religious places, being of most pious in∣tent consecrated to the glory of God, might haue beene according to the Canons of the Church, bestowed in exhibition and almes for Gods Mi∣nisters, reliefe of the poore, redemption of captiues, and repairing of Churches. All Monasteries being thus suppressed; it followed that (vnder a faire pretence of rooting out of superstition) all Chanteries, . 7. Hen. 8. . . Colledges, and Hos∣pitals, were likewise by Act of Parliament left to the dispose and pleasure of the King: And all these Monuments (aforesaid) of our forefathers pietie and deuotion, to the honour of God, the propagation of Christian saith and good learning, Camd. . . . and also for the reliefe and maintenance of the poore and im∣potent (if without offence I may speake the truth.) All these, I say, for the most part, were shortly after; to wit, within the remainder of his raigne, and the short time of his Sonnes, King Edward the sixth: euery where pul¦led downe, their reuenues sold and made a way: and those goods and riches which the Christian pietie of our English Nation had consecrated vnto God, Id . l. since they first professed Christianity, were in a moment, as it were, dispersed, and (to the displeasure of no man be it spoken) profaned. Thus haue you seene, by degrees, the fatall and finall period of Abbeyes, Priories, and such like religious Structures; with the casting out to the wide world of a l their religious Votaries: chiefly occasioned by their owne abhominable crying sinnes, more then by any other secondarie meanes; as plainly doth appeare by the premisses All which Queene Mary attempted to haue restored to their pristine estate, and former glory. But all in vaine; for these religious Edi ices with the lands and possessions thereunto belonging, were so infringed, alienated and transferred, that nei∣ther the power of Maiestie, nor the force of Parliament, could reduce them againe to the proper vse, for which by the Founders they were intended. Howsoeuer she (being a Prince more zealous then poli ke resigned, and confirmed by Parliament, to God and holy Church, all those Ecclesi∣asticall reuenues, Parl. An 2. C 3. C. . 4. which by the authoritie of that high Court, in the time of her father King Henry had beene annexed to the Crowne, to the great diminution and impouerishing of the same. And this she did frankly and freely, moued thereunto by her owne conscience, saying (with a Christian and princely resolution I must confesse) to certaine of her Counsel our , that albeit they might obiect against her, Ho in p 112 that the state of her kingdome, the dignitie thereof, and her Crowne imperiall, could not bee honourably maintained and furnished, without the possessions aforesaid; yet she set more by the saluation of her soule, then she did by ten kingdomes. And whereas in the raigne of King Edward the sixth, In Parl & 4 . c. l. 12. it was enacted, that all the bookes, called Antiphoners, Missales, Grailes, Portuassis, and Latine Primmers, vsed for seruice in the Church, in the time of Poperie, should be clearely abolished; All images grauen, painted, or carued, taken out of any Church or Chappell, with the foresaid bookes, should bee de∣faced or openly burned. She being now more forward then wise to obserue the rites and ceremonies of the Romanists, caused the like bookes and ima∣ges to be bought, and brought againe into all the Churches within her do∣minions. Holy water, Pax, and censers were commanded to be employed at the celebration of Masses, and Mattens, Oyle, Creame, and Spittle, vsed in the Administration of the Sacrament of Baptisme. Altars furnished with pictures, costly couerings, and the Crucifix thereon solemnly placed: Vn∣to whom Lights, Candles, and Tapers, were offered The restauration and dispose of these, as also of all other matters concerning the Church, shee committed to the Pope, and Cardinall Poole his Legate, by whose autho∣ritie and meanes by all probabilitie, In Parl. An . & 2. Phil. Mar. cap 8. In Parl. . Hen. 8. ap. all Statutes made in her father and bro¦thers raigne against the See of Rome, the Pope and his Supremacie were altogether repealed; and the sixe bloudie Articles enacted by Henry the eighth tyrannically put in execution; by force of which (shee being ouer∣swayed by the authoritie of Church men, for of her selfe she was of a more facile and better inclined disposition) so many, in lesse then foure yeares con∣tinuance, were consumed with fire, for the testimoniall of their consciences in that case. eed. cap. 23. In the heate of whose flames were burned to ashes fiue Bishops, one and twentie Diuines, eight Gentlemen, eightie foure Artificers, one hundred husbandmen, seruants and labourers, twentie sixe wiues, twentie widowes, nine Virgines, two boyes, and two Infants, one of them whipped to death by Bonner, alias Sauage, Bishop of London; and the other springing out of his mothers wombe from the stake as she burned, was by the Sergeants throwne againe into the fire. Sixtie foure more, in those furious times were persecuted for their profession and faith, whereof seuen were whipped, six∣teene perished in prison, and twelue buried in dunghills, many lay in capti∣uity condemned; but were released, and saued by the auspicious entrance of peaceable Elizabeth, and many fled the Land in those dayes of distresse, which by her vpon their returne home were honourably preferred, and prouided for according to their worthes. Queene Mary now dead, and Elizabeth of famous memory proclaimed Queene, possessed of her lawfull inheritance, placed in her glorious Throne, and crowned with the imperiall Diadem; presently after followed a Par¦liament, wherein the title of Supremacie, In Parl. An. c. .2. & . and all ancient iurisdictions were againe restored, all forraine power abolished; and for the more augmenta∣tion and maintenance of her State royall, it was ordained and established, that the first-fruits and Tenths of all Ecclesiasticall liuings, with the lands and Scites of Monasteries, giuen away by Queene Mary, should be vnited and annexed againe to the Crowne; that all Statutes should bee repealed, which were enacted by the said Queene Marie, in fauour of the Romish Religion, and that the booke of Common Prayer, vsed in King Edwards time, for an vniforme celebration of Gods diuine seruice in the English Churches, should bee ratified and authorised againe by this present Par∣liament. This Parliament ended vpon the eight of May, vpon the fourteenth day of the same moneth next following, being Whitsonday, diuine Seruice was celebrated in the English tongue, whereby Gods word might be heard in a perfect sound, and the prayers of the Congregation vttered with an vn∣derstanding heart. Soone after in the same yeare certaine Commissioners were appointed in seuerall places, for the establishing of Religion throughout the whole Realme; then all the religious houses which were reedified, erected, or re∣stored by Queene Mary, as the Priory of Saint Iohns Ierusalem; the Nuns and Brethren of Sion and Sheene, the blacke Friers in Smithfield, the Friers of Greenwich, with all other of the like foundation were vtterly suppressed. All Roods and Images set vp in Churches, whose sight had often captiua∣ted the senses of the zealous beholder, and heated the blinde zeale of many poore ignorant people, were now themselues consumed in the fire, and with them (in some places) the copes, vestments, altar-clothes, Amises, bookes, banners, and rood lo s, were like wise burned in the open streets. Vpon the walls, pillars, and other places of all Churches, certaine In∣scriptions were cut, painted, or engrauen, which being holden to be super∣stitious, were as then defaced, erazed, washt ouer, or obliterated: of which a few for example. This Inscription was vsuall to the picture of the blessed Trinitie, repre∣sented by the Effigies of an old man, our Sauiour in his bosome, and a Doue. Ave Pater, Rex Creator, Ave fili, lux Seruator. Ave pax & charitas. Ave simplex, Ave Trine, Ave regnans si e si e, Vna summa Trini as. Vnder the picture of the blessed Trinitie, lib.

The Knights Templers before they came to that house, now called the Temple, had an house in Holborne, which is now Southampton place, where in their Chappell was a representation of Christs Sepulchre, with these verses brought from Ierusalem. Vita mori voluit, et in hoc tumulo requieuit, Mors quia vita fuit nostram victrix aboleuit. Nam qui confregit nigra inferna ille subegit, Educen o suos cuius Dux ipse cohortis. Tartarus inde gemit, et mors lugens spoliatur. Another Inscription vpon the same. Hac sub clausura recubat Christi caro puro, Sub cura semper stat nostra figura. Est Deus hic tantus natus de Vigine quantus, Militie caput hic, mundi medicena iacet hic. Another. Sum Deus, ex quo carnem sumsi, sed sine neuo: lebs mea me ligno fixit pendente maligno; Aspice plasma tuum, qui transis ante sepulchrum. Qui triduo iacui cum pro te passus obiui.

Many were the Altars here in England consecrated to the blessed Vir∣gine Mary, more then to Christ; m ny the pictures and statues, many the Churches erected and dedicated to her holinesse, and many were the ex∣orbitant honours, due onely to our blessed Sauiour, attributed to her hea∣uenly Deitie: As did appeare by Inscriptions numberlesse about her Altars. Of which some few. In celo lata, nos seruet Virgo beata, Sede locata pia; nostri memor esto Maria. Que super astra manet lapsorum vulnera sanet▪ Que celo floret, pro nobis omnibus oret.

Her salutation. Virgo salutatur, verboque Dei grauidatur, Nec grauat intactum gremium verbum caro factum. Virgo parens humilisque Deo cara, sibi viles An uem calcauit, que prima superbia strauit. The nativity of Christ. Virgo parit puerum, lumen de lumine verbum Est vox celestis, lux celica, stellaque testis. In the Churches of Corpus Christi most commonly these Inscriptions following. Hic est cibus qui plene re icit non corpus sed animam, non ventr m sed mentem, si quis ex hoc comederit, viuet in eternum. Panis mutatur specie remanente priore, Sed non est talis qualis sentitur in ore: Res occultatur, quare? nam si videatur, unc abhorreres & manducare timeres.

Indulgences and Pardons granted by the Bishop of Rome, to certaine Churches and Altars, were likewise depensild vpon the walls. In forme as followeth.

Neare to the place where reliques were kept, such a like Inscription was either painted, insculpt, or written vpon a table hanging vpon some pillar or other of the Church. Hic sacra sanctarum si nomina reliquiarum Lector se re velis docet hoc te charta fidelis. De Christi cuna, que virga refloruit vna. Coelo manna datum, paranymphi manna beatum. Mensa gerens cenam, turbamque cibans duodenam. Claud tur & cista chlamys inconsutilis ista. Sanguine Baptiste pariter locis omnibus iste Est sacer & magni sudaria continet agni. The reliques kept in the Church being all thus reckoned, they were con∣cluded much what after this manner. Horum reliquijs constat locus iste celebris Hinc & multorum possemus nomina, quorum Dicere si in tabula locus illis esset in ista; Nos meritis horum redeamus ad alta polorum. Inscriptions neare and vpon Bells. Bels in time of Poperie were baptised, they were anointed, oleo chrisma∣tis, they were exorcized; they were blest by the Bishop: these and other ce∣remonies ended, it was verily beleeued that they had power to driue the de∣uill out of the aire, to make him quake and tremble, to make him at the sound thereof flie, Tanquam ante crucis vexillum: that they had power to calme stormes and tempests, to make faire weather, to extinguish sudden fires, to recreate euen the dead; and the like. And as you may reade in the Romane Pontificals, they had the name of some Saint or other giuen them in their Baptisme; I will bring in for example the Bells of the Parish Church of Winington in Bedfordshire, whose names are cast about the verge of euery one in particular, with these riming Hexameters. Nomina Campanis hec indita sunt quoque nostris. 1. Hoc signum Petri pulsatur nomine Christi. 2. Nomen Magdalene Campana sonat melodie. 3. Sit nomen Domini benedictum semper in euum. 4. Musa Raphaelis sonat auribus Immanuelis. 5. Sum Rosa pulsata mundi que Maria vocata. Vpon or within the steeple these verses following, or others to the same effect, were either engrauen in brasse, cut in the stone, or painted within, on the wall. En ego campana nunquam denuncio vana; Laudo Deum verum, plebem voco, congrego clerum. Defunctos plango, viuos voco, fulmina frango, Vox mea vox vite, voco vos ad sacra, venite. Sanctos collando, tonitrus fugo, funera claudo. Or these. Funera plango, fulgura frango, Sabbatha pango, Excito lentos, dissipo ventos, paco cruentos. For the power of holy water sprinkled vpon the people vpon their en∣trance into the Church, these Inscriptions. Huius aque tactus depellet Demonis actus. Asperget vos Deus cum omnibus sanctis suis ad vitam eternam. Sex operantur aqua benedicta. Cor mundat, Accidiam fugat, venalia tollit, Auget ope , remouetque hostem, phantasmata pellit. Organs, Pulpits, Portals, Crosses, Candlesticks, Roods, Crucifixes, and what else of that kinde were likewise thus inscribed, all which with the rest were erazed, scraped, cut out, or taken away by the Commissioners, and in∣stead of them certaine sentences of the holy Scripture appointed to be pain¦ted or dispensild in euery Church. Thus iudicious Reader thou maiest by this Chapter vnderstand, how, by Gods diuine prouidence, and the depth of state pollicie, first of all, the authoritie of the Pope here in England was abrogated, the Supremacie of the Church in our Kings inuested Abbeyes, and all other such like religious houses subuerted, Superstition and Idolatrie rooted out and suppressed, and how this kingdome, from all Papall infection cleared, and with the Sunne shine of the Gospell enlightned, the true worship of the euerliuing God was established. Which onely true worship that it may continue in our Church without Schismes, rents, and diuisions, vnto the end of the world, let vs all with vnanimous consent both of heart and voice, pray vnto him who is Truth it selfe, and the Authour of all vnitie, peace, and concord. Now gentle Reader giue me leaue to adde vnto this Chapter (howsoeuer thou wilt say (perhaps) it is too long already) the copie of the Kings Warrant to Commissioners, to take the surrender of Religious houses, as al∣so a copie of an Information to Queene Elizabeth, of the frauds and cor∣ruption of such so imployed by her Father; being in my iudgement coinci∣dent with the Contents of the same. Thus the Warrant speakes. Henry, Ex . &c. To or trustie, &c. Forasmoche as we vnderstand that the Monastery of ...... is at this presente in soche state, as the same is neither vsed to the honour of God, nor to the benefyte of our comon welth; we let you wit that therfore being mynded to take the same into our owne hand for a better purpose; like as we doubt but the head of the same will be con¦tented to make his surrender accordyngly; we for the spesyall truste and confydence that we haue in your fidelytye, wisdomes, and discrecions, haue, and by these presents doo authorise, name, assygne, and appoynt yow that ymmediatly reparyng to the sayd howse, ye shall receyve of the sayd Head such a wryting vnder the Couent seale, as to yowr discrecions shall seeme requisite, meete, and conuenient, for the due surrender to our vse of the same; and thervpon take possessyon therof, and of all the goods and implements to be indifferently sold, eyther for redy money, or at dayes vp∣on suffyciente suretyes, so that the same day passe not one yeare and a half. Ye shall deliuer to the sayd Head and Brethren soche parte of the sayd mo∣ney and goodes, as ye by your discrecions shall thynke meete and conve∣nyente for their dispeche. And further to see them have convenyente pen∣syons by yuur wisdomes assygned accordyngly. Whych done, and more∣ouer seeing the rightfull and due debts there payd and satysfyed, aswell of the reuenewes as of the sayd stuffe, as to reason and good conscyence ap∣perteyneth, and yowr charges reasonably allowed; ye shall proceede to the dissolutyon of the sayde howle; and forther in our name take possessyon of the same to be kept to our vse and profyte. Ye shall furthermore bring and convaye to our Tower of London after your seyd discressyons all the rest of the seyd money, plate, Iue les, and ornaments that in any wise shall come to your hands by meane of the premisses or of any parte therof. Straytely chargynge and commandyng all Mai es, Sheriffes, Bayliffes, Constables, and all other our officers, ministers, and subiects, to whom in this case it shall apperteyne, that vnto yow, and euery of yow, in execucion herof they be helpynge, ayding, favoringe, and assistyng, as they will answere vnto vs to the contrary at their vttermost perrilles. Yeven, &c. An Information made to Queene Elizabeth by ...... of the se∣uerall abuses and frauds done vnto the State generall, and Crowne by the corruption of such as haue bine imployed by her Fa∣ther vppon the suppression of the Abbeyes, and Continuance of the same. Part of the corrupt, deceitfull, fraudulente, and vnrighteouse dealinge of many Subiects of this Realme at and since the visitation and suppression of Abbeyes, which with all the rest God by his grace hath made me hate and refuse, and also deteste and resiste in otheres to the vtmoste of my small powere, beyng contrary to this commaundemente of the second Table, Thou shal not eale: wherby the possessiones, reuenues, and treasure of the Crowne have byn vnmesurably robbed and diminyshed, to the great of∣fence of God, and slaunder of the Gospell, and to the no small impoueresh∣ynge and weakenynge of the Imperiall Crowne, and vtter vndoinge of a nomber of your Maiesties pore Tenants and Subiects, and so to the great slaundere of your Maiestie, and withdrawinge of their harts from you, whos Acte it is told them to be, and so to them it semeth, because some of your seales be at all or most parte of them, and the confirmacion of your head officers at the reste: and to the vttere spoyling and vndoynge (before God and good men) of a nomber of lerned persones and exelente witts who vnderstanding that many before them had byne therby greatly en∣riched and advaunced; and that the gapp thervnto as vnto a vertue was made wyde opene for all without any punyshement, but rather commen∣dacions, were and re still the easilier ouercom by temptacion of the wise∣dome of Satane, the world, and the fleshe, to seeke and labour to become riche by like wicked wayes; of whom as the nomber is now of late yeres in∣creased, so also deceave they moore subtillie and detestablie, and in more things then euer before. For redresse wherof, and of a nombere of other cunnynge and clenly Thefts and decepts which I know and can in time re∣member and discouere, beside the multetude out of my compasse sayd by common brute to be in other calings. There must be pennede (by some persones learnede in the Lawe that be knowne to hate all kynds of vnrigh∣teousnes) some strong Act or Actes (to passe by Parliament, and afterward to be roundly executed) with great penalties, forfeitures, and ponyshments, to reche vnto lands, goods, and bodie, as the greatnes or the smalnes of the case shall require, without the which God wil be yet more offended, the Gospell more slaundered, the Crowne more impouereshed and wekened, your people more vndone, your Maiestie more slaundered, your peoples harts more drawne from you, the lerned persones and exelente witts of your people more spoyled, and many other particuler euills will grow thereby, besides Gods great strokes: which at length will come without repentance and amendment: Wheras yf reformacion be had, God wilbe therin pleased, the Gospelle commended, the Crowne enriched, your peo∣ple profited, ther loues towards you encreased; the learned and exelente wittes enforced from deceite, to seeke prefermente and welthe by godly and honeste meanes; and many other things will grow therby, besides Gods good blessing which your Maiestie shall be sure to haue for it. Deceiptfull and vnrighteouse dealings, viz. at and vpon the visitation and suppression of Abbeyes. Wher the Images of gold and siluer, &c. with the costelye Shrines, Ta∣bernacles, Alteres, and Roodloftes, and the pretious Jewelles, rich Stones, and perles, &c. belonging to the same, and the pixes, phallaces, Patenes, Basines, Ewers, candlestickes, Crewets, challices, Sensors, and multitudes of other riche vesselles of gold and siluer, &c. And the costly Alter clothes, curtenes, copes, vestments, Aulbes, Tunicles, and other riche ornaments, and the fine linnen, iette, marble, precious wood, brasse, iron, lead, belles , stone, &c. and the houshould plate, householde stuffe, and furniture of hou∣sholde, and the Leases and chattalles, and the horses, oxen, kine, sheepe, and other cattell, and the superfluous howses and buildings, and multitudes of other things that belonged to Abbeyes, &c. were worth a million of gold. The salles of the parte whereof were so cunningly made, and the pre∣seruation of the rest was suche that your Maiesties Father, and the Crowne of England hade in comparison but meane portiones of the same, of which muche was vnpayd by ill dealinge in many yeres aftre. For the fynding out of which, and punishyng the great decept and fraude, thear was not then, nether hath thear byne at any time since, for the like euilles afterwards also committed to this day any good order or diligent labour taken, but let passe, as though to fynd out and punishe such wickednes were no profite to the Prince and Crowne, or good seruice to God. All which haue byne the easelier let slip, because perhaps some of them that sholde haue punysh∣ed vnder the Prince might also be partly guiltie, and so, Ca ce: Ca¦thee. Item, wher diueres of the Visitores and Suppressores had afterwards yerly allowance of Fees, annueties, corodies, &c. graunted by the Abbeyes, &c. to themselues, their servaunts and friends, was it likely that they came by them without fraude. Item, the most part of the Evedences of Abbeyes and Nunneries were pilfered away, sold and loste, as herein following vnder the title of your Maiesties tyme more playnlie a pereth. Item, Mannores, Landes and T nements, and other hereditaments were ofte solde at vnder yerly Rents, by many subtile deceipts and frawdes. Item, many Lands and Tenements, &c. were sometime solde with thap∣portenances at the old yerly Rents: but where the woods were vnvalued (as ofte they were) the same went from the Kyng without recompen . Item, Mannores, Lands, and Tenements, &c. sold to diuers, and after the woods were felled and solde, and the Rents enhaunced, or for great fines leased out for many yeres, then the same Mannores, lands, &c. were retorned to the kyng in exchange for other lands that had plentie of woods, and were vnenhauncede, and vnleased in all or in parte, or the Leases were nere expyred. Item, muche Lands and Tenements, and many great woods, and other hereditaments were then solde away, wher the money for the same by de∣ceptfull defrawde was not payd in many yeres after the due dayes of pay∣mente. So likewise in the time of the reigne of King Edward the sixt, your Ma∣iesties Brother, many things were done amisse, though not so many and so great as befoar. Exchanges more were then in King Henries tyme, and almost as badde, wherof the Rents of many of them muste needs decaye in a great parte when that Leases shall end that were made by the Exchang r s, or when their Bonds made to warrant thos Rents shall either be lost, or not ex∣tended. Much Lands, &c. were sold at vnder values by great decepte of many. And in the shorte tyme of the Reigne of Queene M ry your Maiesties Sister, many great gifts, Sales, and Exchanges were made, wherein was great deceipt and losse to the Prince and Crowne In your Maiesties time and before, all or the greateste parte of all the Evi∣dences of the Lands, possessions and hereditaments of all the Abbeyes, &c. have by litle and litle by fraudulent meanes byne so pilfered, and solde a∣waye and so drawne into many priuate mens handes, that there is almoste none of them left to your Maiesties vse; so that your Maiestie hath nothing to mainteyne your title yf neede so requyre, but onely the long possession, and your owne Records made since suppression, whereof a nomber of them be gone. This Informer, (a man in authoritie, as appeares by the sequele, of whose name I am ignorant) proceeds further in the rehearsall of many more deceipts, frawdes, and corruptions, vsed by diuers of the Officers of those dayes, onely for their owne lucre and advauncement, which are too many here to set downe; I will end this Chapter with the conclusion of his ar∣guments. When I speke (saith he) write, or worke against thes, and multitudes of like things, what adoe ther is on euery side, and what outcries ther i againste me, and what inward hatred is borne me, which sometime brek s foarth, and shewes it selfe, by their sowre lookes, bittere speches, and taunt and by their liftings at me, and paying me home one way or other when they can themselues, or when others canne for them, your Maiestie wo wondere yf you knewe; And the more because some of them beare great shew and name of good men and Gospelers: But alas piteous ones God a∣mend them and vs all; That we together that prof sse the Gospell may studye and strive not onely to loue and doe what he commands, and to hate and resist what he forbids; But also thos of vs that be in authore to bring all others ther vnto by great intreaty and good rewards, yf that will serve, yf not by roughe threats, and sharpe strokes, as he hath appointed for the bringing home vnto himself of euery creature. CHAP. XVI. The time of the institution of Religious Orders. Their seu rall names and Authours, and the infinite encrease of their Fraternities and Sisterhoods. THe Popes of Rome challenging a succession from Saint Peter, . Op Cro g. pag. 0. and seek∣ing to imitate the Hebrewes, began to institute Ostiaries, Acolites, Ex∣orcists, Readers, Subdeacons, and Deacons. The Office of the Ostiarle was to open and shut the Church doores, Os ati s. to looke to the decent keeping of the Church▪ and the holy ornaments laid vp in the Vestrie; which is now the charge of the Vergers (as I take it) in Ca∣thedrall Churches. Acolites, or Acoluthites, Acolites, or . Vid s s mina Angel S. were to follow and serue the Bishop or chiefe Priest, to prouide and kindle the lights and lamps of the Church▪ and to re∣gister the names of such as were catechized. Exorcists had the power giuen them to expell vncleane spirits; xorcists. and by fasting and prayer, to free such persons as were so possest. Readers, Readers quos Pastores à pasco nominatos putat Am... osius, matut n tempore Prophetarum Apostolorumque scripta legebant, ac populum diuinis lectionibus quasi pascebant. Which Saint Ambrose supposeth to be called Pastours, phes. 4. . by the Apostle Paul : did reade the writings of the Prophets and Apostles, at the time of morning prayer, and did feede, as it were, the peo∣ple with such diuine lessons. The office of the Subdeacons was to set and giue out the Psalmes in so∣lemne tunes, Subde co . to receiue the oblations of the faithfull, to write the liues and Agons of the Martyrs, and to declare, or make more plaine vnto the peo∣ple the Epistles of the Apostles. Deacons had the charge to releeue widowes and orphans, Deacons. and other poore faithfull people; and to distribute vnto them the almes which deuout Christians had giuen to that intent. They were also allowed to preach the Gospell, Summa Angel. li ra D. to interprete the Scriptures, and appointed to adorne the sacred Altars, and helpe the Priest in diuine Seruice (a place officiated now by our Parish Clerkes) these were chosen to bee men full of religion, integritie of life, faithfulnesse and bountie, after the example of the Churhes of Ierusa∣lem and Antioch, riests. who were called Clerkes; some of these were made by the imposition of hands Priests, others Deacons: to the end the Bishop of Rome might imploy them to instruct the Christians which then increa∣sed, and were so many, as he could not alone execute the charge. To these Priests he gaue the chiefe care of soules, to the end that administring the Sa∣craments to the people of God, they might with the Bishop attend prayer and preaching. Op e in loco ad. Presbyterorum vero munus erat baptisare, Episcopis adesse consilijs, orationibus esse intentos, frangere panem in commemorationem Christi, annunciando mortem eius, orare super infirmos, vngentes eos oloo in nomine Domini. The office indeed of Priests was to baptise; to be assistant to the Bishops in Councell, to be attent and earnest in prayer, to breake the bread of life in remembrance of Christ; preaching or declaring his death and passion: to visite and pray for the sicke, giuing them extreme Vnction in the name of the Lord. The Author of the booke called, S lla Clericorum. And Presbyter, saith one, dicitur quasi praebens¦iter ; as shewing the way of saluation to the ignorant people. They were likewise, saith the same Author, called Sacerdotes, men consecrated to God in respect of their sacred orders, and pious imployments: which by him is thus deciphered. Quinque enim sunt dignitates Sacerdotum prae ceteris. Primo dicitur sacerdos quasi sacris dotatus, scilicet sacris ordinibus, quia ipse est in summo gradu, qui est Sacerdotum. Secundò, Sacerdos quasi sacris is ded ∣tus, id est sacramentis; ad sacrisicanda sacramenta; nam ipse sacri ic sacro∣sanctum corpus Domini cum verbis, signis, prodigijs, & caetera sacramenta. Tertiò, dicitur Sacerdos quasidans sacra, dat enim Baptismum, confessio∣nem, poenitentiam, indulgentiam, Eucharistiam, benedictionem, & extre∣mam vnctionem. Quartò dicitur Sacerdos, quasi sacra docens: docet enim verba sancti Euangelij, & articulos rectae fidei. Quintò, dicitur Sacerdos, quasi sacer dux, quasi ducatum praebens, & iter populo ad regna coelorum, verbo sanae doctrinae, et vitae bono exemplo. Whereupon this Distich was compiled: Sacris dotatus, et sacris deditus, atque Sacra docens, sacra dans, et dux sacer esto Sacerdos. Vpon the diuision of Prouinces into Parishes (of which hereafter) and building of Churches (which worke was effected with chearfull deuotion) the fittest men out of this holiest order, were chosen and appointed to con∣secrate the diuine Miestries of the Church. To such, or such particular con∣gregations as were committed to their charge, and of whose soules they had the cure. And such Deacons, which as Parish Clerks, did helpe the Priests in the execution of their sacred office; did most commonly after a short time, enter into the order of Priestood, and tooke vpon them the cure of soules, and the benefit of a fat Parsonage, if they could procure it; in which promotion, if this or that Deacon carryed himselfe proudly, or any wayes no to the contentment of his Parishioners: such was the common saying, Prouerbium. The Priest forgets that e're he was a Clerke. These Priests were called Secular, and such as led a Monasticall life Re∣gular. And so Canons were both secular and regular. Chanons The opinions of the first institutions of Chanons are very diuers; some refer the beginning of a canonicall life to Vrbin the first, a Romane Bishop, who liued about the yeare of Grace 230. Others, and namely Possidomus, make Saint Augustine the chiefe Author of this institution, who when hee had gathered together a companie of godly men, who liued religiously, farre from the noise and trouble of the multitude, being made a Bishop, he built a Monasterie for Clerkes and Priests within his pallace, with whom he might liue in common. Lib. d pracipuis vib Rom. . Onufrius Panuinus writes, that Pope Gelasius the first, about the yeare 493. placed the regular Chanons of Saint Augustine at Latran in Rome; Pope Boniface in the yeare 1298. placed there Chanons secular; Gregorie the twelfth restored the regular Calistus the third brought in secular Chanons againe; and Pope Paul, the second of that name, dis∣possest them, and restored the regular. They were wont to sleepe vpon mattresses, and had blankets of wooll, they fasted much, vsed great silence, and liued in common, hauing nothing proper to themselues: they v ed ex¦ercises two houres in the day, and at the end of the yeare they made their procession. They did not admit any one to the habit vntill hee were seuen¦teene yeares old; and they gaue themselues to studie and preaching. The rule of these Chanons (confirmed by many Popes) consisted chiefly vpon three points, to haue nothing of their owne, to bee chaste, and to keepe their cloisters. Which rule is deciphered in the old cloister of the Mona∣sterie of Saint Iohn Lateran, in riming verses, now hardly to be read, thus Canonicam formam sumentes discite normam, Quam promisistis hoc claustrum quando petistis, Discite sic esse tria vobis adesse necesse; Nil proprium, morum castum portando pudorem, Claustri structura sit vobis docta figura: Vt sic clarescant anime, moresque nitescant Et stabiliantur animo qui canonicantur. Vt coniunguntur lapidesque sic poliuntur. Thus regular in holinesse of good life, In the Plow∣mans tale. and also in learning, both Priests and Chanons were of ancient times, but how irregular afterwards, let Chau∣cer tell you. Popes, Bishops, and Cardinals, Chanons, Parsons, and Vicare In Goddes service I trow been fals, That Sacraments sellen here, And been as proud as Lucifere. Eche man looke whether that I lie, Who so speketh ayenste her powere It shal be holden heresie. In another place. And all such other counterfaitours Chanons, Canons, and such disguised, Been Goddes enemies and traitours, His true religion han foule despised. As Goddes goodnesse no man tell might, Write, ne speake, ne thinke in thought, So her falshed and her vnright May no man tell that euer God wrought▪ And thus. They vsen horedome and harlottrie, Couetise, pompe, and pride, Sloth, wrath, and eke envie, And sewen sinne by euery side, Alas where thinke such to abide, How woll they accompts yelde: From high God they mow hem not hide, Such willers witte is not worth a nelde. Passus 14. Ex Mss. in bib. Cot. Piers the Plowman thus blanklie speakes of their pride. Sir Iohn and Sir Ieffery hath a girdle of siluer, A Baselard or a ballocke knife, with buttons ouergilt, And a Portus that shuld be his plow. Placebo o synge, Had he neuer seruice to saue siluer therto, seith it with idle will. And hereupon he exhorts lay-men not to bee so liberall in bestowing their goods vpon the Clergie. Thus. Alas ye lewd men much lese ye on Pryests, And a thinge that wickedly is won, and with false sleights Would neuer wit of wittye God, but wicked men it had, The whych ar Pryests imperfit, and Prechers after s uer. That with gile is gotten, vngraciously is spended; Executours and sodemes, samoners and their lemmans: So harlots and hoores are holpen with such goods, And gods folks for defaulte therof, forfaren and spill. These Canons had many cloisters here in England, great lands and re∣uenues, and were wondrous rich, the first Chanon Regular in this king∣dome was one Norman, whom Matilda wife to King Henry the first pre∣ferred to the gouernment of her Priory, called Christ-church, now the Dukes place within Aldgate London. There are foure rules, or religious Orders, that is to say, of S. Basill, S. Au∣gustine, S. Benet, and S. Francis, vnder which all other orders are compre∣hended and gouerned. Of which my old Author Robert Longland, siue Io∣hannes Maluerne in the vision of Piers Plowman giues a touch: where he speakes of Pardons and Popes Bulls, on this manner. At the dredfull dome whan the dead shall arise Pas us . And comen al to fore Crist, accountes for to yeue How thow leadest thy life here, and his lawes kepest And how thow diddest day by day the dome wil reherse. A poke full of Pardons there ne prouinciall lettres, Though ye be founden in the fraternyte of the iiii. orders, And haue indulgence an C. fold, but if Dowel ye help, I beset yowr Patentes and yowr Pardons at a pyes hele. And thus the same Authour in another place, speaking of the pilgrimage to our Ladies Shrine at Walsingham. Hermets an heape with hoked staues, Wenten to Walsingham, and her wenches after, Great loubies and long, that loth were to swinke Clothed em in copes, to be knowen from other, And shopen hem hermets, her ease to haue. I found there Freres, al the foure orders, Preched to the people for profit of themselues, Glosed the Gospel as hem good liked, For couetous of Copes construe it as thei wold. So Chaucer in his prologues and in the Character of the Frier mentions foure Orders. A Frere there was a wanton and a merry, A Limy our, a full solempne man: In all the Orders foure is none that can So much of daliaunce and faire language. But to returne to the first of the foure orders, The which is that of S. Basill, (howsoeuer as I conceiue the order of Saint Dominicke was accounted one of the foure here in England) this Basill surnamed the Great, for his great learning, liued about the yeare of Grace 300. he was a Priest in Caes a, the chiefe Citie of Cappadocia where he was borne, and whereof afterwards he was chosen B shop. He was the Authour of building of Monasteries, whereas many might liue together, for before his time the Monkes dwelt in caues and cels alone, in desarts and solitarie places, from the which hee drew them into Coenobies or Couents: and instituted of discipline, by the which they should no more wander, but bee alwayes bound by one forme of Religion. These Monasteries were schooles, in the which the arts, and Philosophie, together with Diuini ie, true Religion and pietie were taug t, to the end there might be learned and fit men alwayes readie to gouerne the Church; it is said that he built so great and spatious a Monasterie in Armenia, as it contained aboue 3000 Monkes; and in the end reduced all the religious men of the East to a good forme of life. He died in the yeare 379, full of yeares as of vertues, when Damasus the first of that name held the See of Rome, and the Emperour Valens an Ari n gouerned the East▪ This Emperour was determined to haue dispossessed him of his Bishop∣pricke, as he had done others, but hearing him preach, and speaking with him at Cappadocia, he absteyned from expelling him his seate; to which effect P. Opmer. thus. Basilius tantae doctrinae ac sanctitatis suit, 316. vt et Valens abstinueri ab ex∣pellendo eum sede, cùm reuersus Cappadociameum concionantem audijsset, at∣que venisset cum illo in colloquium. It is holden that this Basill was the first which caused Monkes to make a vow, after a yeares probation, to liue in their Monas eries vntill death, to promise full obedience to their superiours, and not to contradict their ordi¦nances, and moreouer to vow continencie and pouertie. This order where∣soeuer they liue, labour with their hands in imitation of the perfect Monkes of Aegypt: and what they get with their labour, they bring in common, retaining nothing to themselues. This order of this holy man doth flourish at this day in Italy, especially in the dominions of Venice, although all the Monasteries there which are of this order, doe acknowledge the Abbey of Grottaferata, twelue miles distant from Rome for their mother. I doe not finde that any of this rule liued euer here in England: which makes me be∣leeue that this was none of the foure Orders before specified. The order of S. Augustine. The next Monasticke Order confirmed by the Church of Rome, was that of the Doctor of all Doctors, namely, Saint Augustine ; He was borne in the Castle of Tegast in Carthage, about the yeare of our redemption 358. his Fathers name was Patricius, his Mothers Monica, by whose intrea es, mingled with teares, and the learned Sermons of Saint Ambrose, hee was drawne from the errours of the Manachies; from Saint Ambrose as then Bishop of Millan in Italie, he returned into his owne countrey, where hee obteyned of the Bishop of Hippo (whereof he was afterwards Bishop him∣selfe) a garden without the Towne, causing a Monastery to be built there, in which he liued of the labour of his hands in all integritie, according to the institution of the Primitiue Church. He died of a feuer at Hippo▪ when he had sitten fourty yeares in his Bishopricke, being seuenty and six yeares of age, on the fifth of the Kalends of September, leauing to posteritie, two hundred and thirty bookes of his owne writing. This order multiplied greatly throughout the whole Christian world, howsoeuer branched into many seuerall orders, differing both in habit and exercises, as also in rule and precepts of life. An Epitaph to the memorie of Saint Augustine which I found in the booke of Rufford Abbey. Omnis plorat homo mox matris vt exit ab aluo, Et merito, quoniam ve it in vallem lachrimosam. Solum nascentem risisse ferunt Zoroastrem, Ergo monstrosum crede risum liquet istum; Primus enim rerum fuit inventor magicarum. Hoc Augustinus testatur vir preciosus. Vir doctus, vir magnisicus, vir quippe beatus. The order of S. Benet. About some fourtie yeares after the death of Saint Augustine, Saint Be∣nedict, vulgarly called Benet, appeared to the world, who is accounted the Patriarch and Father of all the Monkes of Europe. Hee was borne in Vm∣bria, a region in Italy, of the noble familie of the Regards, his Fathers name was Propre, his Mothers Abundantia, hee was sent to Rome at the age of ten yeares to learne the liberall Arts, but being wearie of the tumults and warre during the raigne of Iustinian the Emperour, hee went from thence into a desart neare vnto Sublacke, a Towne some fourtie miles from Rome; where he continued the space of three yeares or thereabouts: doing very austere penance vnknowne to any saue one Monke called Roman ; but being afterwards discouered by certaine Shepherds, the people (by reason of the great ame of his integritie and holinesse of life) flocked from all parts to see him; who had such force to perswade them to abandon the world, as in a short time they built twelue Monasteries, and hauing giuen to euery our of them a good Superiour or Abbot, desiring solitarinesse, he retired him∣selfe with a good number of his best disciples, to the mount Cassin, neare to the Towne of old called Cassina. Where hauing ruined all the idolatrous Temples, and broken downe their Images; hee built him a Monasterie, which hee dedicated to Saint Iohn the Baptist, with a Chappell to Saint Martin. Drawing all the Monkes, dispersed in Italy, into one societie and companie, to whom he gaue a certaine rule in writing, by the which they and their successours should gouerne themselues, according as Saint Basill had done before him; and withall bound them to three seuerall vowes, Chastitie, Pouertie, and Obedience to their superiours, which decree was ratified by the Church of Rome for an Euangelicall law. This congrega∣tion of the Benedictines grew by little and little to bee so great throughout all Christendome, as is almost incredible. Nulla Monasteria nisi Bene dictina erat apud Anglos ab aetate Edgari vsque ad regnum Gulielmi primi. There was no Monasteries, saith a late Writer, amongst the English from the time of King Edgar, till the raigne of William the Conquerour, but Benedictines. This order, saith the same Authour, came first into England with Austin the Monke, Bishop of Canterbury. Hee the said Saint Benet, died about the yeare of our Lord fiue hundred and eighteene, and was bu∣ried in his owne Oratorie consecrated to Saint Iohn : where as before was wont to be the Altar of Apollo. He liued 63. yeares. Saint Francis was borne in the Towne of Assile in the Duchie of Spole∣tum in Italy; The order of S Francis. in his young yeares he dealt in the trade of Merchandise, but by reason of a great sicknesse, at the age of two and twenty yeares, he con∣temned all worldly dealings, and gaue himselfe wholly to heauenly medita∣tions; he put a shirt of haire vpon his bare skinne, and a sacke vpon it, gird∣ing himselfe with a cord, Opmer. opus Cron g, ad a . 12 . going also without hose or shooes, Et victus osti∣atim emendicans, begging from doore to doore; so as the fame of him being spread ouer neighbour countreys, many drawne by his holinesse abando∣ned the world, and became his disciples, making profession of pouerty, but yet to labour and take paines for a poore liuing. For these he built an Ab∣bey in the Towne where he was borne, and wrate a rule, as well for those which were vnited vnto him, as for such as should come after him, which was approued and confirmed with many Indulgences, Priuiledges, Graces, and Pardons, by Pope Innocent the third, and Honorius that succeeded him; After the confirmacion whereof, he ordained that his Friers should be cal∣led, Fratres minores, or Minorite Friers, to witnesse their greater hu∣militie. One Adam Sousbout a Germane Diuine, Opmer. opus Cron g. ad ann 1225. Ann. 1227. vpon his entrance into this order, writes thus to his Father at Delphos. Quàm sit vita breuis, quam sit via lubrica, quamque Mors incerta: bonis quae praemia, quaeque parata Sint tormenta malis, horum meditatio nostra est, Quod facimus, quod firmamus, quod et esse perenne Optamus testamentum, Saluete, valete, Care pater, cari Fratres, caraeque Sorores. ca. 34. This Scraphicall Saint Francis died the fourth of October, 1226. and was canonised by Pope Gregorie the ninth, ann. 1276. Ann. 1224. About two yeares before the death of Saint Francis, these Friers Minorites came into England, Et benigne a Rege Henrico tertio sunt suscepti, & Cantuar, collocati fuerunt : They were graciously receiued of Henry the third, and placed in Canterbury. And afterwards, anno 1269, one of the Ance∣stours of Sir Dudley Digge, commonly called Digges, Emit Insulam vo∣catam Bynnewyght in Cantuar. et locum Porte super stonestreete ad opus Fratrum Minorum, land Com∣ment. et tempore oportuno transtulit Fratres ad illam, bought an Island in Canterbury called Bynnewyght, and the place of a gate ouer Stone-streete for the vse of the Friers Minorites, to which hee translated them in conuenient time. . The Friers Minors (saith Stow, first arriued in England at Douer, nine in number, fiue of them remained at Canterbury, and did there build the first Couent of Friers Minors that euer was in England; the other foure came to London, and lodged at the preaching Friers the space of fifteene dayes, and then hired an house in Cornhill of Iohn Traners, one of the Sheriffes, they bui ded there little cels, wherein they inhabited, the deuo∣tion of the Citizens toward them, and also the multitude of Friers so in∣creased, that they were remoued by the Citizens to a place in S. Nicholas Shambles, which Iohn Iwyn Citizen and Mercer of London, appropriated vnto the Communalty of the Citie, to the vse of the said Friers, and became himselfe a lay Brother. The order of S. . Contemporarie with Saint Francis was Saint Dominicke, a Spaniard, borne in a Towne called Calogora, in the Diocesse of Osma. His fader was namyd Felix, and his Meder Iohane, saith an old Agon: from Calo∣gora hee came into Gascoigne, where hee continued ten yeares preaching, and drawing Christian Princes into armes against the Albigeo s, certeyne Heretiques, Qui damnato matrimonio vagos suadebant corcubitus; atque sum carnium prohibebant. Who condemned Matrimonie perswaded li∣centious copulations, and forbad the eating of flesh, whose errours hee re∣pressed by his Sermons From thence he went to Rome to the Councell of Lateran, vnder Innocent the third, where hee obtained licence of the said Pope▪ to put himselfe vnder what rule he should like best▪ that was allowed by the Church: whereupon he made choise of that of Saint Antonie, with sixteene of his disciples, and hauing made certaine constitutions, it was con∣firmed by Honorius the third; about the yeare of our Lord, 1206. Then going to Tholouse he exhorted his Friers, and sent them to preach, two and two together, perswading them to bee preachers both in deed and name; These Friers Preachers came first into England in the yeare 1221. where they had louing entertainment and houses built.

Sanctus Dominicus sit nobis semper ami us, Cuicanimus nostro iugiter praeconia ros ro. De cordis venis siccatis ante lagenis. Ergo was laudes si tu nos pangere gaudes, Tempore Paschali, fac ne potu puteali Conveniat vti: quod si sit, vndique muti Semper erant Fratres, qui non curant nisi ventres. All things degenerate in time, and stray in a manner from the right course; for example, the order of Saint Benet which had flourished a long space with great reputation of holinesse, di ered so much from the first in∣stitution of their Founder, that neither the decrees and authoritie of holy Fathers generall and prouinciall Councels could reforme or draw them to their first principles, vntill the sanctitie of one Odo, or Otho, Abbot of Clu∣ Burgandy, and one of Saint Benets order, reuiued in a manner from to life this Monasticall profession, forcing them to obserue▪ and ob∣seruing himselfe from point to point all that was practised in the time of S. Benedict. So as many of their Abbots which were drawne by his good ex∣ample, reformed also their Abbeyes, not onely in France, but as well in Sp ne, Germany, Italy, and England; and for that this reformation his first beginning at Cluni; the vnion of so many Abbeyes was called the congregation of Cluni, and euery yeare, by the Popes permission and au∣thoritie, all the Abbots of this congregation met at a certaine place, and they called it the generall Chapter, whereas they treated of the order and life of Monkes, putting out, and punish ng such as had offended. This Odo liued in the yeare of our Lord, 913. It was no long time after, ere that these Benedictines fell againe to their old vomit, Ciste ci n Monke. their great wealth hauing made them, proud, idle, luxurious, carelesse of Gods house; and in most or all of their actions, extreamely vi∣tious. Whereupon one Robert Abbot of Molesme a Towne in Burgundy, pe ceiuing that the Benedictines Monkes of his owne house (as of all other Monaster es) had almost quite left and forsaken the ancient rule and disci∣p i e that Benet had giuen them; he left his owne house, taking with him one a d twenty of the honestest Monkes he could finde, to a solitarie stu∣pendiou , and neuer inhabited place, called Cisteux, or Cistercium, neare to gres, in the said Duchie of Burgundy, where hee erected a new Ab∣bey for his new companions, whom hee called Cistercians, of the place where the Abbey was scituated. The liberties, immunities, and priuiledges of this Order was generally confirmed by Alexander the fourth, Bishop of Rome, circa An 1258.

Pontificatus, nostri Anno secundo. . M ss. in bib. Co . This Cistercian Brotherhood was first established here in England by one Walter Espeke, who founded the first Abbey of the said Order at Ri∣uaux, or Rivall in Yorkeshire, about the yeare 1131. according to this old Distich, sometimes depicted vpon the wall at the entrance into the said Abbey. Anglia Millesimo centes. Anno quoque et vno. Christi et tricesimo, micuit Cistercius Ordo. Some fifteene yeares after this foundation, and about the yeare 1098. S. Bernard surnamed the Mellifluous, a man noblely descended, borne at the Castle of Fountenay in Burgundy, with thirtie of his companions, amongst which three were his owne brethren, became religious men in this Mona∣sterie. This Bernard in short time became very famous, as well for his learning (of which his diuine writings full of sweetnesse beare witnesse) as for the holinesse of his life, in regard of which hee was sent by his superiour to lay the foundation of that great and famous Abbey of Clareuaux, or Claravallensis, neare to the riuer Aulbe, about Lang es; which Abbey a Nobleman of the countrey had then lately built; and thus began the Monkes of the Order of Saint Bernard, ernar▪ li Monke . which is all one with the Cistercian Monkes, sauing a little difference in the habit, both of them obseruing the rule of Saint Benet. This good man Saint Benet came to the Abbey of Ci∣steux, when he was eighteene yeares old, at the age of 25 he was consecra∣ted Abbot of Claravall: Opus Cron. pag. 371 ad An. 11 8. Et diuino magis instinctu, quam humana industria legem Domini didicit, quam tanta doctrinae munificentia, et eloquij suavi∣tat enarrauit, vt communi Doctorum consersu Mellistui Doctoris cognomen sit adeptus, saith Opmer. The Archbishoprickes of Genua and Millan hee refused, and onely contented himselfe with the gouernment of this Abbey of Claravall, in the which he continued 38. yeares. Hee died the fifth of Nouember, about the yeare of Grace, 1160. and was buried in his owne Monasterie, when he had liued, 63, yeares. He built the Monasterie of Saint Vincent and Anastasius in Rome, to the gouernment of which he prefer∣red one Peter Bernard, his Scholler, who was afterward Pope of Rome, by the name of Eugenius the th rd. In his time by himselfe and his meanes one hundred and sixe Abbeyes of this Order were built and reestablished; vpon the forefront or some other places within these Abbeyes, this sen∣tence is most commonly depensild, grauen, or painted; taken out of Saint Bernard. Bonum est nos hic esse, quia homo viuit puriùs, cadit rariùs, urgit v lo∣ciùs, incedit cautiùs, quiescit securiùs, moritur felic ùs, purgatur , & praemiatur copiosius. Amongst many Epitaphs made to the immortall memorie of this Melli∣fluons Doctor, these following may suffice. Ecce latet clare vallis clarissimus Abbas; Qui summis summus, qui sibi parvus erat; Relligionis apex, lux mundi, laus Monachorum, Vox verbi, pacis sanctio, iuris amor.

Iste fuit per quem patuit doctrina sophie Preco Dei, Doctor fidei, Cytarista Marie. It is said by one, S. B rn. that approaching neare to his end, he spoke thus to his brethren: Tria vobis obseruanda relinquo, que in stadio presentis vite quo cucurrimemini me pro viribus observasse. Nemini scandalum facere volui & si aliquando accidit sedaui vt potui. Minus semper sensui meo quam al∣terius credidi. Lesus de ledente nunquam vindict im expetij. Three things I require you to keepe and obserue, which I remember to haue kept to my power, as long as I haue been in this present life. I haue not willed to slan∣der any person, and if any haue fallen, I haue hid it as much as I might. I haue euer lesse trusted to my owne wit and vnderstanding, then to any o∣thers. If I were at any time hurt, harmed, or annoyed, I neuer craued ven∣geance of the partie which so wronged me. Which is thus more succinctly set downe by another, who hath written the life of the said Bernard. Beati Bernardi metricum Testamentum Et primo sui Prioris interrogatio. Que vite forma, qui mores, que sacta norma Quid d ceat quid non, instrue sancte pater. Respunsio ipsius Bernardi.

Within one hundred yeares after the first spreading abroad of these Ci∣stercian and Bernardin Monkes; the Benedictines wanted another refor∣mation▪ which was attempted by Peter, one of the same Order, surnamed oron, of a Mountaine so called; at the foote of which he liued in a caue for the space of three yeares, doing daily penance. Vpon this mountaine he built a little Church, which he called of the holy Ghost; be ware a wayes a l aine of Iron vpon his bare flesh, vpon it a shirt of haire, being in continuall prayer, and reforming the rule of Saint Benet, which was then much degenerated. Hee obtained of the Pope a confirmation of his rule, vpon which hee celebrated the first generall Chapter of his Order. After which in the seuentie ninth yeare of his age, he was chosen Pope, about the yeare of our redemption, 1 94. by the name of Celestin the fifth, where vpon this reformed order were called Celestins: the number of which in∣creased so fast, that he himselfe consecraced for them fixe and hirtie cl ∣sters in Italy, wherein were sixe hundred Monkes; amongst others this was one of Celestin the Popes caueats for his new reformadoes. Tunc Celestinus cris si celestia mediteris. If heau'nly things thoult meditate, Then shalt thou liue in heuenly state. Their first comming into England was much what about the yeare 1414. The sanctitie of the Francischan Minorite Friers growne cold, one Ber∣ ard of Sienna, a gentleman of a noble extraction, moued with an holy and deuotion, laboured much for the reformation of that Order, which some assistants effected, taking away the abuses which were crept causing the Friers to liue in common, and to haue nothing proper to , following simplie the institution of their father Saint Francis called Obseruant Minorite Friers, because they were obseruan∣ S. Francisci & propterea meliores: more obseruant to keepe the and orders of Saint Francis, and therefore the better. This Order the yeare of Iubile, 1400. or thereabouts: it was first confirmed by Cou ell of C s nce ▪ afterwards by Eugenins the fourth, and other the fourth brought them into England, and Henry the seuenth auhmented their numbers: in whose time they had six famou Cloisters here in this kingdome. Many other reformations haue been time to time of the Franciscans, as by the Minims, Reco lects, Pen ∣ries, Capuchins, &c. and by many others; which happened sinced ∣lution here in England, or much what thereabouts. One Norbert Archbishop of Magdebourgh, leauing the world, retired himselfe with certaine companions into a certaine place called of which this order tooke denomination, where hee squared himselfe, his fellowes and successours to obserue, much what after the or∣der of Saint Augustine ; which was approued and confirmed by Calixtus the second. Honorius the second made them regular Charions. Their Ab∣bots were perpetuall, and euer consecrated by Bishops. They had power to conferre their lesser Orders to their Monkes, and to blesse all th ornaments of the Church, and to do all other ceremonies, but where as conse ration is required in the blessing; yet they might celebrate so emne and Masse, with the myter, crosier staffe, cappe, and other ornaments, which belong to the Episcopall order and dignitie. The first institution of this order was about the yeare 1120. their first house here in England was at Newhouse in Lincolnshire. These Votaries pretend to haue had their first institution at mount Car∣mel in Syria, where Elias and other heretofore liued solitarily, and that the place being inhabited by many Hermites; Almericke Bishop of drew them together, liuing dispersed about the mountaine, and them a Monasterie in that mount neare vnto a fountaine. They say a f th r one Albert Patriarch of Ierusalem, a very famous man, set downea rule from the life of Elias, out of a certaine Greeke booke of the institution of the first Monke, and from the rule of Saint Basill the Great, giuing it to keepe to one Brocard, who was Prior of Mount Carmell, and to his Her∣mits, which rule of Albert they vowed to obserue, which was afterwards confirmed by Pope Honorius the third. They affirme that the Virgine Mary appeared vnto one of their order, and presented vnto him a Scapu∣larie, saying, Receiue, my beloued, this Scapularie which I giue vnto thy order, in signe of my fellowship. Whereupon they vsurpe the title of tres Ordinis beatae Mariae Virginis de monte Carmelo : Friers of the Order of the blessed Virgine Mary of mount Carmell. Their first apparition the world was about the yeare 1170. Their entrance into England, and seating themselues at Newenden in Kent, of which hereafter, was about the midst of the raigne of King Henry the third. These, like as other Or∣ders, haue beene diuers times reformed, euer as they did degenerate from their primitiue sincerity: at this day they are called Carmes discalced, or bare footed Friers, by a certaine constitution confirmed by the Apostolique au∣thoritie, in a generall Chapter held at Alcara de Henares, in the yeare of our redemption, 1581. There were likewise Carmelin or Carnie Nunnes here in England. Iohn Bale who writ of the writers and the best learned men of great Britaine, writ also a large Treatise of this Order of Carmes, or Carmelites: whose antiquitie, institution, and progresse he sets downe in one of ∣sages, as followeth.

He speakes much in the honour of this religious Order, of which hee was a member in the Monasterie of the Carmes within the Citie of Nor∣wich; and findes himselfe much aggrieued at a certaine Lollard, as he calls him, and a Frier mendicant, who made an Oration and composed certaine virulent meeters against this and other of the Religious orders; which hee caused to bee spread abroad throughout the most parte of England, in the yeare 1388. and here will it please you reade these his cursing rimes.

These Sathanicall strong lines (as the phrase is now) did at the first gre ly distaste my end Author Iohn Bale, being one of the Fraterni∣tie: Sed deformitatem suam videbat, but afterwards when as he say his owne deformitie and blindnesse, exuebat habitum sise professionis, he put off the habite of his cloistered profession; he rooted out, erazed, and defaced the maleuolent character of Antichrist (as hee saith himselfe) and consequently embraced the reformed Religion; and writ many-most bitter Inuectiues against al sorts of our English Votaries. This Bale flourished in the raigne of King Henry the eighth, and was li∣uing in the second yeare of Edward the sixth, about which time he writ his Centuries. Thus much (which is more then I determined to haue spoke) touching the order of the Carmes. The order of Grand Mont was instituted at Grand Mont in Limosin in France, The Order of about the yeare of our redemption, one thousand seuentie sixe, vn der the rule of Saint Benedict, by Stephen a gentleman of Auuergne, who being sent by his father to Molon Bishop of Be uent, to bee instructed by him, he spent twelue yeares learning the institutions and rule of Saint Be∣nedict. Going from thence, and hauing duely obserued the liues of many Hermites, and Monkes, and seene what was worthie of imita i n, in the end he se ed himselfe vpon the top of an high hill in Limosin, being at that time thirtie yeares old, whereas hee built a little cottage. Hee prescribed a rule of Saint Benedict to his disciples, himselfe liuing with bread and water, and died being eightie yeares old. I finde very few Couents of this religious Order here in England, one there was at Abberbury in Shropshire confirmed by the Bull of Gregorie the ninth, Bishop of Rome: as followeth. Gregorius Episcopus Seruus sernorum Dei. Dilectis filijs Priori & Fra∣tibus de Abberburi Grandimontensis ordinis Hereforde. Dioc. Salut. & Apostolicam benedictionem.

To speake nothing of their opinion (being altogether vnprofitable) who , Saint Peters disciple and Bishop of Rome, or the of the holy Crosse. was the first founder of this order. It is receiued for more truth, that one Cyriacus Pa∣triarch of Ierusalem (who shewed S. Helen (the mother of Great Constan∣tine ) where the Crosse was whereon our blessed Sauiour was crucified) was th first that instituted this Order, in memoriall of the inuention of the Crosse; and gaue ord that these Friers should euer afterwards carrie a Crosle in their hands: but by reason of his martyrdome, vnder the Apostata Iulian, and the cruell persecutions of the Christians, this or∣der became almost quite extinguished, vntill Pope Innocent the third gaue it new life: since which time it ha h euer flourished here and beyond. Seas with some little reformation like the rest of its fellowes This holy order came into England in the yeare of our saluation, 1244. Their first C oister was at Colchester, their greatest Monasterie was neare vnto the Tower hill London, as yet called by the name of Cruched Friers. They did not of late as the first institution, carry the Crosse in their , but ware a crosse of red cloth or skarlet fixed to then habit on their breast. About the yeare 13 7 the order of the Trinitarian Friers came into Eng∣land; Trinita ian . an order whose chiefe charge was to go and gather money to re∣deeme Christians that were captiues vnder the ranny of the and Infidels; whereupon they were called Monachi de Redemptio e rum, Monkes of the redemption of captiues. This order was instituted by a Frier, called Iohn Matta, and Felix Anachorita, who liued a solitarie life in France, and were warned in their sleepe (as the tale goes) to repaire to Rome to the Pope, and to seeke for a place of him, to build them a cloi∣ster. Which they did, and their petition being to them granted, they laid the foundation of the Monasterie now called Saint Thomas of the Mount, in mount Celia Rome; wherein Frier Iohn died, and was buried, as ap∣peares by an Arch or ancient Sepulchre of marble in the little Church of the said Church, on the which this Epitaph or Inscription is engrauen. Anno Domini et incarnationis 1197. Pontificatus verò domini Innocentij Pape terij Anno primo 15 Kaldanuar. institutus est nutu Dei Ordo Sanctis∣simae Trinitatis. et captiuorum à Fratre Iohanne, sub propria regula sibi ab Apostolica sede concessa; sepultus est idem Frater Iohannes in hoc loci. Ann. Dom. M. CC. XIII. Mense Decembris vicesimo primo. Yet for all this these Trinitarians say, that the holy and blessed Trinitie, and not Frier Iohn, nei∣ther any of the Saints, gaue them this their rule and order, to which effect in all their Couents these Rimes are painted or engrauen. Hic est ordo ordinatus, Non à sancto fabricatus, Sed a solo summo Deo. This blessed Order first began By God, and not by Saint, nor man. Robertin . For the foundation of these Friers, I will vse the words of the famous Antiquary Iohn Leyland in his Commentaries; who flourished in the raigne of King Henry the eighth, Cui à Bibliothecis erat ; who died in the raigne of Edward the sixth of a Phrenesie, to the great griefe of all such as then did, or ow do take delight in the abstruse studie of reuerend Antiquitie. Hee lieth buried in Saint Michaels Church in Pater Noster Row, London. The Priorie of Knasborough, saith hee, is three quarters of a mile be∣neath Ma ch Bridge, which goes ouer Nid, one Robert Flower, sonne of one Tork Flower, that had beene twice Maior of Yorke, was the first be∣ginner of this Priory: he had beene a little while before a Monke in New minster Abbey in Morpeth, within the County of Northumberland, for∣saking the lands and goods of his father, to whom hee was heire and first∣borne sonne, and desiring a solitarie life as an Hermit, resorted to the Rockes by the riuer of Nid, and thither, vpon opinion of his sanctitie, others resorted; for whom and himselfe he built a little Monasterie; got institu∣tion and confirmation of an Order about the yeare 1137 which after his owne name he called Robertins. Howsoeuer his companie of Friers were instituted of the order De redemptione captiuorum, alias, S. Trinitatis. King Iohn, as he saith, was of an ill will to this Robert Flower at the first, yet afterwards very beneficiall both to him and his. Some of the Flowers lands at Yorke, were giuen to this Priory, and the name of the Flowers of late dayes remained in that Citie. Many miracles, as it is said, were wrought at the Tombe in his owne Priory, wherein he was interred. Eodem anno claru t fama Roberti Heremitae apud Knaresburgh, cuius oleum medicinale fertur abundanter emisisse. In the same yeare the same of Robert the Hermite of Knarsborrow spread it selfe clearely abroad; whose Tombe, as the report went, cast forth abun∣dantly medicinable oyle, saith Mat. Paris the Monke of Saint Albon , who liued in those dayes. This Order, as I take it, was abolished before the dissolution. These Friers challenge and deriue their first institution from Saint An∣tonie, . who liued about the yeare of our redemption, 345. howsoeuer they obs rae and follow the rule of Saint Augustine ; but whosoeuer was their first Patron it skills not much. Vpon this occasion following, they came first into England. Edmund, the sonne and heire of Richard Earle of Cornwall, who was second sonne to King Iohn ; being with his father in Germany, where be∣holding the reliques, and other precious monuments of the ancient Empe∣rours, he espied a boxe of Gold; by the Inscription whereof hee perceiued (as the opinion of men then gaue) that therein was contained a portion of the bloud of our blessed Sauiour. He therefore being desirous to haue some part thereof, by faire intreatie and money obtained his desire, and brought the Boxe ouer with him into England: bestowing a third part thereof in the Abbey of Hales; which his father had founded, and wherein his father and mother were both buried, thereby to enrich the said Monasterie, and reseruing the other two parts in his owne custodie, till at length moued vpon such deuotion as was then vsed, he founded an Abbey at Ashrugge in Hertfordshire, a little from his Manor of Berkamsted, in which hee placed Monkes of this order, Bon∣hommes, Good men: and assigned to them and their Abbey the other two parts of the said sacred bloud. Whereupon followed great resort of people to those two places, (induced thereunto by a certaine blinde deuotion) to the great emolument and profit of these Good-men the religious Vo∣taries. The superiour of this Order was called a Rector, or a Father Guardian. Bethlemit Friers. About the yeare 1257. the Bethlemit Friers had their dwelling in Cam∣bridge, who should be the first institutor I do not reade; their rule and ha∣bite was much what like that of the Dominicans; sauing that they wore a starre in their breast wrought vpon their habite, in memoriall of the starre which appeared at the time that our Sauiour was borne in Bethlem. This Order was extinct before the suppression. This religious Order was first instituted in the yeare of our Lord God, 1080. vpon this occasion (the story is frequent) a Doctor of Paris, famous both for his learning and godly life; being dead and carried to the Church to be buried, when as they sung ouer his bodie the lesson which begins, Re∣sponde mihi quot habes iniquitates, Answer me how many iniquities thou hast, the bodie, sitting vp in the coffin, answered with a terrible voice, Iusto Dei iudicio accusatus sum: I am accused by the iust iudgement of God: at which voice all the companie being much amazed, they defe red the inter∣ment vntill the next day; at which time vpon the rehearsall of the same words, the body did rise in like manner, and said, Iusto Dei iudicio iudicatus sum, I am iudged by the iust iudgement of God. The third day hee raised himselfe vp as before, saying, Iusto Dei iudicio condemnatus sum, I am con∣demned by the iust iudgement of God. Amongst many Doctors which assisted these Funeralls, one Bruno, a German, borne at Colleyn, of a rich and noble familie, Chanon of the Cathedrall Church of Rheimes in Cham∣paigne, being strucken and fearfully affrighted at this strange and neuer-heard of spectacle, began to consider with himselfe, and to reuolue and i e∣rate very often these words following, Si iustus vix salvabitur, impius & peccator vbi erit: If such a pious man as hee was in the opinion of the world, be damned by the iust iudgement of God (thinkes hee) what will become of me and many thousands more, farre worse and more wicked in the eye of the world then this man was. Vpon this deepe consideration, Bruno departed from Paris, and tooke his iourney together with sixe of his Schollers, to liue solitarily in some wildernesse; and not long after came to the Prouince of Dolphine in France, neare to the Citie of Grenoble, where hee obtained of Hugh Bishop of that Citie, a place to build him a Mona∣sterie, on the top of an high stupendious hill, called Carthusia, from whence the Order tooke the name. They gaue themselues to silence, and reading, and separated themselues by little Cels one from another, lest they should interrupt one anothers quiet. They spent some houres in the labour of their hands, and some in the writing of godly books, both to relieue their wants, and to do seruice to the Church of God. Many workes of theirs are still ex∣tant; out of which, tending to mortification, the Iesuite Parsons collected the Resolution. They did macerate their bodies by fasting and discipline, and in the end resolued to eat no flesh, during their liues. This donation of Bishop Hugh (who became himselfe one of their or∣der) was confirmed by Hugh Bishop of Lions, and afterwards by Pope Vrban the second. The said Pope Vrban (as the story, which I haue read, depicted round about the Cloister of the Carthusians at Paris, doth shew) sent for the foresaid Bruno to Rome (whose disciple hee had beene) where he remained for a time, and did much helpe to pacifie the troubles there at that time by his prayers; he parted from Rome, and taking his way by Ca∣labria, he came into a desart, called the Tower in the Diocesse of Squilace, where he stayed with his compa ions, making their residence in certaine caues vnder the ground. The which when one Roger the Prince of that countrey vnderstood, he went to visit this holy man Bruno, and gaue to him and his societie all that desart; whereas they built a Church, in the which Bruno remained alone, where his companions liued, and in that place hee died, ann. 1102. and there was buried. Vpon whose Sepulchre this Epitaph was insculped. Primus in hac, Christi fundator ouilis, Eremo Promerui fieri, qui tegor hoc lapide. Bruno mihi nomen, Genetrix Germania, meque Transtulit ad Calabros grata quies nemoris. Doctor eram, Preco Christi, virnotus in orbe: Desuper illud erat, gratia non meritum. Carnis vincla dies Octobris sexta resoluit. Ossa manent tumulo, spiritus astra petit. He was canonized in the yeare 1520. Priors of their grand Monasterie at Carthusia from Bruno the first, Antiq de Paris liure und. till Bruno d' Affrinques, who gouerned that house, ann. 1611. haue beene fourty and foure. This order came into England about the yeare 1180. and at Witham in Somersetshire built their first cloister. Afterwards they came to London and had a faire sumptuous house neare vnto Smithfield London, which is now Suttons Hospitall; another they had called Sein or Shene, in the coun∣tie of Surrey, now best knowne by the name of Richmond. There were foure Orders here in England of begging Friers, Begging F ier who did challenge for their Patrons S. Augustine, S. Francis, S. Dominicke, and Saint Basill, but in their discipline and rule of life, they came farre short of their first Institutors, who both tooke paines with their hands as la∣bourers, and as learned writers, as their workes do testifie; of all Orders these Mendicants haue euer been most bitterly inueighed against by their owne writers: as I shall shew hereafter. Quidam nouus ordo Fratrum Londini apparuit, Friers of the backe. & incognitus. Papale tamen autenticum palam ostendens; ita vt tot ordinum confusio videretur. A certaine new and vnknowne order of Friers appeared in London; shew∣ing openly the Popes authenticall Bull for their admission; so that then there seemed to be a confusion of so many Orders, In An 1297. Hen. 3.41. saith Paris. These were called Fratres de poenitentia Iesu, or Fratres de Sacca: Friers of the repen∣tance of Iesus, or Friers of the Sacke, for that they carried sacks, and for that they were clad in sackcloth. These had their first house a little without Al∣dersgate London; and obtained licence of King Henry the third in the fifth yeare of his raigne, Stow Survay. to remoue from thence vnto any other place, and with∣in some two yeares afterwards hee gaue to them the Iewes Synagogue in Colmanstreet ward, which was defaced by the Citizens of London, after they had slaine seuen hundred Iewes, and taken away all their goods. After which time Eleanor, wife to King Edward the first, tooke into her prote∣ction, and warranted vnto the Prior and Brethren De poenitentia Iesu Chri∣sti, of London, the said land in Colechurch street, in the Parish of Saint Olaue in the old Iury, and S. Margaret in Lothbury, by her granted, with consent of Stephen de Fulborne, Vnder-Warden of the Bridge-house, and other Brethren of that house, for threescore Markes of siluer, which they had receiued of the said Prior and Brethren of Repentance, toward the building of the said Bridge. This Order of Friers gathered many good Schollers, and multiplied in number exceedingly, vntill by a generall Councell it was decreed, that there should no more Orders of begging Friers be permitted, but onely the foure Orders, and so from that time these Friers decreased and fell to nothing. There were also Nunnes of this order, Nuns Sa∣chettes. which were called Sachettes, whe∣ther they had any Couent in England or not, I do not know. But great S. Lewis King of France, being stirred vp by Queene Blaunch his mother, in the yeare of our saluation, Antiquitez. de Paris lib. 2. 1261. hauing giuen vnto the Brethren of the Sacke, or of the repentance of Iesus Christ, a certaine house vpon the riuer of Seine, a little beneath S. Michaels bridge, in the Parish of Saint Andrew des Artes at Paris, as by his charter (which I haue read) appeares, gaue also to the Nunnes of the same order, another house to inhabite in the said Pa∣rish, where neither of the orders made there any long abode but were ex∣pelled in the time of the said King, leauing onely the name of Sachettes vn∣to the streete. The order of S. Iohn of Ieru∣salem. About the yeare 1048. (the Sarazins being masters of Ierusalem, and of the holy Temple which they ruined) certaine gentlemen and Italian Mer∣chants vsed to frequent the ports and maritime towns of Syria and Aegypt, who (for that they brought merchandise which was pleasing vnto those countries) were well entertained, not onely by the gouernour of the Towne, but by the Calife of Aegypt. These Christians going often to Ierusalem to visit the holy places, and hauing no place of retreat within the citie, they obtained leaue to build a Church, a Pallace, with certaine Monasteries for the lodging of Pilgrimes. But in the end they caused an Hospitall to bee built for the receiuing of all sorts of Pilgrimes, both sicke, and whole, and in like manner a Church, which was dedicated to S. Iohn Baptist. In the yeare 1099. the citie of Ierusalem being recouered against the im∣pulsions of the Infidels by Godfrey of Bullein Duke of Lorraine, this order was instituted; Sandys Rela∣tion. the Kings of France were soueraignes of this order, who granted them diuers immunities. They bare fiue crosses gules, in forme of that which is at this day called Ierusalem crosse, representing thereby the fiue wounds that violated the bodie of our Sauiour. None were to be admit∣ted if of a defamed life, or not of the Catholike religion. They were to be gentlemen of bloud: and of sufficient meanes to maintaine a port agreeable to that calling, without the exercise of mechanicall sciences: as appeares by these demands propounded by the Pater-Guardian vpon their admission and the Knights answers. Antiq. de Paris, lib. 2. Guard. Quid quaeris? Miles. Quaero effici Militem sanctissimi Sepulchri. Guard. Cuius co ditionis es? Mil. Nobilis genere, Pare bis, & Christianis ortus. Guard. Habes vnde litaris dignitatis conseruare possis absque mercibus et Habeo Dei gratia. They tooke the Sacrament to heare euery day if they might conueniently; if warres were commenced against the to serue there in person, or to lend other in their stead no To oppugne the persecutours of the Church, to shunne vniust warres, honest gaine, and priuate duels. Lastly, to be reconcilers of dissentions, to aduance the common good, to defend the widow and orphane, to from swearing, periurie, blasphemie, rapine, vsury, sacriledge, murder, and drunkennesse: to auoid suspected places, the companie of ; to liue chastly, irreproueably, and in word and dead to the ∣selues worthy of such a dignity. This oath taken, the Pater his hand vpon his head, as hee knee ed before the entrance saying, Esto tu fidelis, strenuus bonus & robustus iles Christi, & sanctissimi Sepulchri, quite cum lectis suis in a cello re∣dignetur. Amen. Then he gaue him a paire of spurres which he put on his heeles, and after that a sword, being before h llowed with this Exaudi quaesumus Domine Deus preces nostras, & , qua se ∣mulus tuus hic cingi desiderat, Maiestatis tuae dextera dig quatenus possit esse defensor Ecclesi rum, vidu runu, , que Deo servientium, contra Paganorum saeuitiam, sit terror atque formido praestans ei aequè persecutionis & effectum. Per Dominum nostrum Iesum Christum Amen. Then he him to vse this sword in defence of the Church, and himselfe, and to the confusion of Infidels, by these words. Accipe N. sanctum gladium. I nomine Patris, et Filij, et Spiritus s ncti. Amen. Et vlaris eo ad tuam, et sanctae Dei Ecclesiae, et ad confusionem inimicorum sidei Christianae: et quantum humana imbecillitate poteri , laedas. Quod ipse praestare dignetur qui cum Patre et Sp rita per omnia secula seculorum. Amen. The sword being aga Knight was to gird himselfe there with: to whom the Pater Guardian spoke. Accingere N. gladio tuo super faemur inum potentiss me. Domini nostri Iesu Christi: Et attende quod sancti non in si∣dem vicerunt regna. Then the Knight arising, and forthwi kneeling to the Sepulchre, enclining his head vpon the same, he was citated by the said Pater-Guardian, by receiuing three strokes with a sword shoulder, and by the saying of these words following thrice o er. I go con∣stituo et ordino te N. Militem sanctissimi Sepulchri Domini nostri Iesu Chri∣sti. In nomine patris et filij et Spiritus sancti. Amen. I constitute and ordaine thee N. a knight of the holy Sepulchre of our Lord Iesus Christ, in the name of the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost. Amen. Anno Dominii 1117. Gotfredus Aldemarus Alexandrinus, and Hugo de Planco de Paganis ( Godfrey (aforesaid) Duke of Lorraine, and King of Ierusalem being dead, and Baldwin then raigning) this order of Knight∣hood first began, and a seat was granted them in the Temple of Ierusalem, whereupon, they were called Knights Templers, or Knights of the Tem∣ple. By entreaty of Stephen Patriarch of Ierusalem, Pope Honorius brought in this order, and confirmed their societie, giuing them a white garment, whereunto Eugenius the third added a red crosse on the breast. The charge of these Knights, was, to guide Trauellers on the way of Ierusalem, and to entertaine strangers. Of the time when these, as also the other Knights, came first to haue Hospitalls and houses here in England, I do speake here∣after. Monkes and Nunnes Gil∣bertines. Bale. Cent. 1. In the yeare after Christs Natiuitie, 1148. (contrarie to Iustinians con∣stitutions, which forbad double Monasteries, that is to say, of men and wo∣men together) one Gilbert, Lord of Sempringham in Lincolnshire, whose fathers name was Ioceline, a knight; this Gilbert was a man very deformed in his body, but very studious and learned. Hee went ouer into France, where by his study in the liberall Arts, he obtained both the name and de¦gree of Master: and comming home, hee instructed both the boyes and girles of his owne countrey in the same disciplines. Out of which number, when they came to maturitie of yeares, he collected a company consisting of men and women, and gaue them a rule to obserue, which hee had taken out of Saint Augustine, and Saint Benets rules. Eugenius the third, Bishop of Rome (admiring much his deuotion and forwadnesse, like as others did his holinesse) confirmed this his religious order. Which so grew and in∣creased, that himselfe laid the foundation of thirteene religious honies of the same Order, Cent. 2. whereof the chiefest was at Sempringham, and whiles he li∣ued (which was one hundred and sixe yeares) had in them seuen hundred Gilbertin Brethren, and eleuen hundred Sisters, parted one from another by walls you must thinke; of which, as also of the whole order, a scoffing Poet of those dayes thus versified: Nige . Wircker in specule stulto∣rum. translated by Bale in the Acts of English Vo∣taries, out of Latine thus. The Monkes sing the Masse, the Nuns sing the other, Thus doth the Sister take part with the Brother. Bodies, not voices, a wall doth disseuer; Without deuotion they sing both together. Againe thus. What should I much prate; An order it is begun of late, Yet will I not let the matter so passe, The silly Brethren and Sisters, alas Can haue no meeting but late in the darke, And this you know well is a heauie warke. Againe of these Friers and Nuns. Some barren are of these, some fruitfull bee, Yet they by name of Virgins couer all: More fertile sure and better beareth shee, Who blest is once with croysier Pastorall: Now scarce of them is found one barren Doe, Till age debarre, whether they will or no. The order of S. Brigide or Briget that holy Queene of Sweden, in the yeare 1376 did institute the like order (as aforesaid) of Monkes and Nunnes, which was confirmed by Gregorie the eleuenth, in the first yeare of his Popedome. She obtained of the said Pope, that the Monasteries of her said order should bee common as well for men as women: yet there should bee such a s paration by walls, as the one should haue no meanes to come vnto the other, but vpon great necessitie. She would also haue but one Church for both sexes, and that the Monkes as Ministers of sacred things should bee below, and the Nunnes aboue, to say their seruice and prayers; but the Lady Abbesse should haue power to command both: yet men should haue charge of tha which did belong to the Diuine Seruice, and to the ornaments of the Church, and that there should be one amongst them that should be called Prior, or Confessour. She also ordained, that they should haue lands and possessions wheron to liue, but the superintendance to prouide for all things that should be needfull, for the one and the other, as well for victualls, as apparell, should belong vnto the Abbesse. That it should not bee lawfull for either men or women to go out of their Monasterie, without great ne∣cessitie, and then they should demand leaue of the Abbesse. They held the rule of S. Augustine, with certaine Articles added by this famous Queene. Some are of opinion, that this forme of Religion was first inuented in Greece, but that the Fathers had ordained, that the men should remaine seperated from the women, lest they should giue occasion of scandall: wherefore Saint Brigide desiring to reuiue this order, she found meanes how without any suspition, the Church and house should be common to bo h. She ordained that they should weare a russet habit, with a cloke of the same colour, with a red crosse vpon their breasts. Shee would haue but sixtie Nunnes, and fiue and twentie Monkes in euery Monasterie: that is to say, thirteene Priests, according to the number of the thirteene Apostles, com∣prehending Saint Paul. Then foure Deacons; who might also be Priests, and represented the foure Doctors of the Church: and eight Conue ts, who might alwayes be readie to labour for the affaires of the house: so as the Friers and Nunnes all together, made the number of the thirteene Apo∣stles, and the seuentie two Disciples of our Sauiour: And to the end they might be distinguished one from another, the Priests carried a red Crosse vpon the left side of their cloke, vnder which crosse they put a little peece of white cloth, as broad as a wafer, which they offered vp in reue∣rence of the holy Sacrament. And the foure Deacons, for a difference from the Priests, carried a round wreath of white cloth, which signified (as they gaue out) the sapience of the foure Doctors, whom they represented, and vpon it they put foure little peeces of red, made like vnto tongues, to shew that the holy Ghost inflamed their tongues to deliuer the sacred mysteries of Diuinity. The Conuerts wore a white crosse vpon their clokes, to shew the innocencie of their liues, vpon which there were fiue peeces of red, in commemoration of the fiue wounds of our Sauiour. At the dissolution there was a Couent of this Order, at Sion in Mid'e sexe; now a mansion goodly faire house belonging to the right honourable the Earle of Northumberland. This holy Lady Brigid died at Rome, and her daughter Katherine, Prin∣cesse of Nerice, caused the rule, after her death, to be confirmed by Po e Vr the fifth: She came to Rome at the age of two and fourtie, where she continued eight and twentie yeares, she was canonized in the yeare of Grace 1391. There was another S. Brigid of Ireland, farre more ancient. It is said that the image of our Sauiour spoke to this pious Queene of Sweden, as she was saying her orizons before the high Altar in the Church of Saint Paul in Via Ostiensi Rome: as appeares by an inscription vpon a table hanging in the same Church, which I haue seene. As many orders, or neare thereabouts, as were of Friers, so many were of Nunnes here and beyond Seas, for men in the feruencie of deuotion did not precede the weaker sex of religious women. The strictest Order of Nunnes is that of S. Clare ; The poore Clares. A Lady who liued in the same time, and was borne in the same Towne of Assile with S. Francis. Which Towne to this day brags of the birth of two such worthie persons. These Clares obserue the rule of their Patron S. Francis, and weare the like habit in colour. They are neuer rich, and therefore to this day wheresoeuer they doe inhabite, they are called the poore Clares.

Clare, (saith her Legend) touching the world was of rightworthy and honourable linage: Iacob. de Vora g ne. and, as touching the spi∣rit to the regard of the state of vertues, and holy manners towards God, of right noble reputation. Hermi es. Anchorites. Hauing spoken already of such religious persons as I finde to haue liued here in England in Coenobies or Couents, at the time of the generall disso∣lution: it remaines now, to say somewhat of Hermits and Anchorites, who had at that time their solitaire little cells or cabbins in diuers places of this kingdome, which carrie still the name of Hermitages, in and about the countrey, and Anchor-holds, in Parish or Abbey Churches. They were called Hermites, or Eremites, for that they liued solitarily in desarts and wildernesses; and Anchorites because they liued alone without all compa∣ny; immured betwixt two walls, in the out side of some Abbey, or Parish-Church, in which, by their rule, they were to liue, die, and to bee buried. Whose exercise was feruent prayer, handy labour, digging and filling vp againe their graues, which were to be within their lodgings. Of the begin∣ning and first Authors of the Hermites life there is great question, which I leaue vnto the learned; and adhere to the common receiued opinion, which affirmes that the times of persecution were the first cause of this kinde of life. For when as in the time of Decius and Valerianus, Emperours, about two hundred fiftie and two yeares after Christ, they prepared horrible tor∣ments against the Christians, many distrusting the weaknesse of the flesh, and searing to denie the name of God by their intollerable persecutions, thought it fittest to seeke their safetie by flight: Wherefore many leauing Townes, fr ends, and all their wealth, retired themselues into desarts, and held themselues in solitarie places and caues, where they bu lt poore cot∣tages. Yea many times they went wandring vp and downe in thicke woods lest they should bee taken. But when the surie of their t ran , ceased, they returned not vnto the world, but liued voluntarily in desarts, so being accustomed to diuine contemplation, and a quick kinde of , they continued in the course vntill death. Among the first which entred into this course of life, was Paul of Thebes, who liued in a caue at the foote of a rocke; about the yeare of our redemption, 260. The second was Saint An∣tonie of Aegypt, who built himselfe a cottage vpon the top of an high hill, where he died hauing liued one hundred and fiue yeares, in the yeare 34 S. Hierome of Stridone in Dalmatia, that learned and religious Doct the like life in the desarts of Syria, not farre from Jerusalem: In quo lo o deserto se ieiunijs macerabat, plangebat, orabat, sludebat, atque, etiam m mentabatur. In which vninhabited place, he macerated, or made leane, his bodie with fastings; he lamented and bewailed his sinnes, he p ayed▪ he stu∣died, and writ certaine Comments vpon the sacred Scriptures: Many other workes he writ before his death, which happened about the yeare of our Lord, 388. But to come nearer home where the repute and godlinesse of these Her∣mites or Anchorites (for both of them liuing from the companie and con∣uersation of men; were called sometimes by the name of Hermites, and some other time of Anchorites) was likewise had in venerable regard for we reade that when seuen British Bishops, with other learned men of the Monas e of Bangor, were to meete Austin the first Archbishop of Canterbury, con¦cerning certaine points tending to the Catholicke vnitie and concord, they came first (saith venerable Bede ) to a certaine holy and wise man, which liued thereabout an Anchorites life, to aske his counsell, whether they ought at Austins preaching and exhortation, to leaue their traditions, or no: And we reade, in the said Authour, that Cuthbert Bishop of Durham (en∣forced thereto by the King) increasing in the merit of religious and holy deuotion, came also to the secret silence of an Anchors life and contempla∣tion: that by prayer he brought forth water out of a stonie ground, and al∣so receiued graine by the labour of his owne hands, and that out of all season of sowing. And I haue seene the Psalter translated out of Latine into English, by one Richard a religious Hermite, In the of bra e. the antiquitie whereof may bee gathered by the character of the English, of which I will giue you an Essay, of certaine parcels.

In the like language are all the Collects, Epistles and Gospels, for the whole yeare, much what as we haue them in our Church, as also the Pater∣noster, and the Creede. All which by the Dialect, I gesse to haue beene translated by this Hermite in the dayes of King Henry the second, compa∣ring them with the English of that Pater Noster and the Creed, which Adrian the fourth Pope of Rome, an Englishman, the sonne of Robert Breakespeare, Stow. Annal. . H. 2. of Abbots Langley in Hertfortshire, sent to the said King Hen∣rie the second, as followeth. Pater Noster.

This Hermite likewise translated all the Psalmes of Dauid with a gloss or exposition in English vpon euery Pslame.

Selden tells vs of a Psalter in that famous Bodleian Librarie in Oxford, with a metricall translation of the Psalmes, the which, as h e is perswaded by the character, was englished about the time of King Edward the second, where he giues vs the first Psalme as a taste of the idiom or forme of our speech in those dayes; which a wicked hand (saith he) by cutting the first Capitall left a little imperfect.

And in the same place you may reade a verse or two of the fifteenth Psalme, thus rimed. Louerd who id thi Te . T ld who s l wun In the heli hille or who rest mun? He that in comes spo tlesse w mles, And euer wickes rightwisenes. Here the more willingly (to vse the words of the transcriber of these Psalmes) I haue inserted these parcels of the Psalter, that by this occasion my Reader might palliate his taste with an Essay of our Ancestors old Eng∣lish, as well in the curte composition of their prose, as in the nearnesse of their holy meeters, which howsoeuer abounding with libertie, and the cha∣racter of their times, yet haue, I confesse, my admiration. And (for a conclusion) we reade in Henry Archdeacon of Huntington that a certaine Anchorite, or quidam vir Dei, as he calls him, prophesied in King Etheldreds dayes, that forsomuch as Englishm n were giuen ouer to all drunkennesse, treason, and carelesnesse of Gods house, first by Danes then by Normans, and a third time by the Scots they should be ouercome. Of which I speake elsewhere. Helen of anchit are Anchoreste. To this retyred holy Order aforesaid, women were admitted as well as men. For I reade in an old Lieger booke that one I sold He on widow (vn∣like in conuersation to these Anchorites I haue spoken of, or the Anchores es in the Primitiue times) made sure to King Henry the sixth, that shee might be an Anchoresse, or vowed recluse, in that part of the Abbey of Whally, anciently ordained for that purpose; which was granted and thus con¦firmed.

But this religious Votaresse tooke no great delight in her straight lodg∣ing, as appeares by the story: for within a short time after, she being desi∣rous of more libertie, broke out of her cage (as other such like holy Sisters had done before her) and flew abroad in the open world. Whereupon the Abbot and Couent of the said Monasterie, made certificate following to the King. To the Kyng owr souereigne Lord, &c. Be hit remembryd that the please and habitacion of the seyd Recluse is within place holowed, and nere to the gate of the seyd Monastre.

This Anchoresse hauing taken vpon her so strict a vow, and being thus loose in her life and conuersation, Rob. Langland. Pass. 8. some may very well imagine that Nuns, which had more libertie allowed them by their rules, were farre more li∣centious; and indeed the Author of Piers the Ploughman speakes (in the person of the Frier Wrath) somewhat reprochfully of his Aunt a Nunne and an Abbesse. As also of other like Votaresses and Votaries, which with his introduction followeth. I am wrath, quoth he, I was sometyme a Frere, And the Couents gardiner, for to graften impes, On Limitours, and Legisters, lesings I imped Til thei bear leaues of smoth speach Lordes to please; And sithen thei blosomed abrod, in bour to hear shrifte Now is fallen, therof a fruit that folk han wel liuer Shew her shrifts to hem than shriuen hem to her persons And persons haue perceiued that Freres part with hem.

I am challenged in chapter house as I a child were, And balaced on the bare ars. Thus haue I spoken of all the religious Orders, which I finde to haue beene cloistered here in England at the time of the dissolution of Religious houses, howsoeuer their number might bee farre more then I haue spoken of. Vol. 1. pa 236. For. I. Fox in his Martyrologe alphabetically sets down a catalogue of an hundred and twelue seuerall orders of Monkes, Friers, and Nuns, here and beyond seas, whose rules were confirmed by seuerall Popes; all branch∣ed from the foure Primitiue institutions of Basill, Augustine, Benet, and Francis. Of which increase, for a conclusion to this Chapter, as also to this discourse, one Lelius Capilupus, a Catholike Romane in his Anatomie of the Romane Clergie, hath formerly written in Latine verse, thus not long since Englished. But though I had an hundred tongues and moe, I could not tell how many sorts there be, Nor shew the names and orders which do flow From this wast Sea in their posteritie. CHAP. XVII. Of the sundrie wayes and meanes by which Religious Votaries, and others of the Clergie, enriched themselues, and other Churches Of Pardons, Pilgrimages, and Romescot. AL Churches are either Cathedrall, Conuentuall, or Parochiall. Ca∣thedrall, is that Church, where there is a Bishop seated, so called, à Ca∣thedra, the chaire or seat. Conuentuall, consisteth of regular Clerkes, pro∣fessing some order of Religion, or of Deane and Chapter, or other Colledge of spirituall men. Parochiall, is that which is instituted for the saying of Diuine Seruice, and ministring the holy Sacraments to the people dwelling within a certaine compasse of ground neare vnto it. Of which more in the next Chapter. I will begin with Conuentuall Churches. As the number of Religious Orders increased, and as Religious houses were daily more and more replenished, insomuch that the donations of their Founders were not thought (by themselues) sufficient, they deuised other meanes to increase their liuelihood; and the better to maintaine their high state and comportement; and one was, by the admittance of lay peo∣ple into their Fraternities: the forme whereof was after this manner follow∣ing, as I haue it out of the collections of Nicholas Charles Lancaster Herald, deceased.

I finde in the golden Register of Saint Albans (a Manuscript in Sir Robert Cottons Librarie) aboue two thousand men, women, and children, lay-per∣sons of the Nobilitie and Gentrie of this kingdome, to haue beene thus ad∣mitted into that one Monasterie: all of which gaue either lands, goods, iewels, plate, copes, vestments, or some ornament or other to the Church and Couent. The religious Votaries likewise, either by themselues, or their friends, gaue somewhat or other vpon their first admittance into any of these Mo∣nasteries: of which I could giue many examples, but in place take one for all, I bib. Cot. which I haue read in the Lieger booke of Saint Maries the Nunnery at Clerkenwell. Where Sir William de Sancto Georgio, or Saint George knight (one of the Ancestors of Sir Richard, S. George Clarentieux now li∣uing) giues to the Prioresse and her Sisters of the foresaid Saint Maries Cler∣kenwell; with Mabell his daughter, vpon her admittance into their Nun∣nery, halfe a Verge of land in Kingstone in Cambridgeshire. Test. Willelmo de Baus. Roberto de S. Georgio. Roberto de Hasselingtonfeld, &c. a deed sans date. And by another deed the said Sir William Saint George giues to the said Priorie of Clerkenwell, for the soules health of himselfe, his father, his mo∣ther, and his wife; and with Albreda his sister, who was to be a Nunne of the said house, his land in Hasselingfeld, within the foresaid Countie of Cambridge, which Robert Russis held in pratis in pascuis, &c. Test. Eustac. de Bancis, Willelmo de Bancis, Roberto de Sancto Georgio, &c. And many others having large portions in their owne possessions, out of zeale and deuotion, would giue all, with themselues, to some Cloister or other, and therein take vpon them the habite of Religion. As many English doe in these dayes vpon their admission into religious Orders beyond Seas. They were wondrously enriched by the burials of great personages, for in regard of buriall, Abbeyes were most commonly preferred before other Churches whatsoeuer: and he that was buried therein in a Friers habite, if you will beleeue it, neuer came into hell. Vpon their visiting and confessing of the sicke, they euer vsed some per∣swasiue argument or other, that it would please the sicke person to bestow somewhat more or lesse (according to his or her abilitie) towards the main∣tenance of their Fraternities, or the repairing of their Monasteries; and that he would bequeath his bodie to be interred in the Church of their Couent, with a promise that they would daily say prayers and make intercession for his soule. They got likewise by confessing such as were in perfect health, giuing them absolution, and enioyning them penance, according as they re∣ceiued gratuities. Of all which, will it please you reade these passages fol∣lowing, copied out of the Author of Piers Plowman, and Geffrey Chaucer. And First Piers the Plowman, Passus vndecimus, speaking how Friers couet to burie men for their goods. Go confesse to some Frier, and shewe him thy synnes, For while Fortune is thy frend Friers will the loue, And fetch the to their Fraternitie, and for the beseche To her Prior Prouinciall, a Pardon to haue; And pray for the pole by pole, if thou be pecuniosus. Sed pena pecuniaria non sufficit, pro spiritualibus delictis. I sayd I nolde Be buried at their house, but at my Parish Church: For I hard once, how conscience it tolde: That kind wold men be buried wher thei wer christined. Or wher that he were Parishen that ther he sholde be grauen. And for I said thus to Friers, a fole thei me helden, And loued me the lesse, for my lely speche. And yet I cried on my confessour that helde himselfe cunnynge. That none wolde wed widowes but for to weld her goods, Right so by the Rode * rought you neuer Where my body wer buried, by so ye had my siluer. I haue much marvaill of you, and so hath many other Why your Couent coueteth to confesse and bury, Rather than to baptise Barnes that be catechislinges. And Passus decimus tertius. Friers folowed folke that wer riche And folke that wer pore at litle price they set. And no cors in hir kyrkeyard, nor kyrke was buried, But quick he bequeth hem ought, or quit part of his dets. The Frier, in Chaucer, perswading with the sicke farmer, to make his confession to him, rather to his Parish Priest, hauing his hand vpon his halfepennie, In the So p¦ners tale. makes this request to the bed-rid man lying vpon his couch. Yeue me then of thy gold to make our cloister, q oth. Quod he, for many a muskle and many an oister, When other men have been full well at ease, Hath been our food; our cloister for to rease. And yet, God wot, vnneath the foundament Performed is, ne of our pauement Is not a tile yet within our wones By God we owen fourty pound for stones. The same Author in the Prologues to his Canterbury tales, and in the character of the Frier, thus speakes of the absolution and easie penance they gaue to men in health, where they thought some commoditie would thereby accrew to themselues and their Couent. Full sweetly heard he confession, And pleasant was his absolution. He was an easie man to giue penaunce, There as he wist to have a good pitaunce, For vnto a poore Order for to give, Is a signe that a man is well yshryve: For if he gaue ought he durst make avaunt, He wist well that a man was repentant: For many a man is so hard of hert, That he may not weepe although him smert: Therefore in stede of weeping and prayeres, Men mote giue siluer to the poore Freeres. The Priests likewise in general as well of Cathedrall, Parochiall, as of these Conuentuall Churches got much by saying of Masses; Passus vndeci∣mus. as it is intima∣ted to vs by Plowman in these few lines following. If pryestes were perfite they would no siluer take For Masses, ne for Mattens, ne her meates of vsurers, Ne nether kirtle ne cote though thei for cold shold die. But that which brought most riches to all the foresaid Churches, was the Shrines, Images, and Reliques, of this or that Saint, in this or that Church especially honoured and preserued; to the Visiters whereof (who with great cost and labour did vndertake so holy and deuout resolution) great Indulgences and Pardons were granted by seuerall Popes (as will appeare by the sequele) and so semblablie to their sacred Altars and other holy places: and such like Indulgences and Pardons they were, as were anciently granted to the Churches in Rome; which will not seeme imper∣tinent (I hope) here to set downe, as I haue them out of an old booke in broken English, which crept into the world in the minoritie of Printing, and is commonly called, The Customes of London. But, before I go any further, let me tell you, that Reliques were euer holden in most reuerend regard, amongst all sorts of people, insomuch that in the taking of any so∣lemne oath, they vsed to lay their hand vpon certaine Reliques, as they did vpon the holy Euangelists; For I heard that King Henrie the second being to cleare himselfe of Archbishop Beckets death, S. Danyel in vit. H. 2. at a generall assemblie hol∣den within the Citie of Auranches, in the Church of the Apostle Saint Andrew, before the two Cardinals, Theodinus and Albertus, the Popes Le∣gates, and a great number of Bishops, and other people, made his purga∣tion in receiuing an oath vpon the holy reliques of the Saints; and vpon the sacred Euangelists, that he neither willed, nor commanded the said Arch∣bishop to be murdered. The hoole Pardon of Rome graunted by diuers Popes. Videsis Onu∣phrium de septē santioribus vr∣bis Romae Ec∣clesijs. In the cite of Rome ben iiii chirches in which is Masse daily don, but ther ben vii of the same priuileged aboue all the other with gret holines and Pardon, as is here aftir shewid. The furst is called Saint Peters Chirch th'appostell, and is set vpon the fot of an hill, and men goo vpward thertoo a steyer of xxix steppes high, and as oft as a man gooth vp and downe that steyer, he is relesid of the se∣uenth part of penaunce inioyned and graunted by Pope Alysander. Item, as ye come before the Chirch ther the well sporingeth, so may ye see aboue the dore an Image of our Lord, and betwene his feete stondith oun of the pence that God was sold for, and as ofte as ye looke vpon that peny ye haue xiiii C. yerys of Pardon. Item, in the same Chirche on the ryght side is a pilour that was some∣tyme off Salamons temple, at whiche pilour our Lord was wonte to rest him whan he preched to the people, at which pylour if ther any be frentyk, or madd, or trobled with spyritts, they be deliueryd and made hoole. And in that Chirge be xi aulters, and at euery aulter is xlviii yere of Par∣don, and as many Lentes or Karynes: and vii of thoo aulters ben seuerally priuelegyth with grace and Pardon. At the furst aulter is the vysage of our Lord; who loketh vpon that hath vii. c. yere of Pardon. Item, at the same aulter is the spere that Crist was parced with, whych was broght from Constantynenople, sent from the gret Turke to Pope In∣nocent the Viii. The second aulter is of saint Andrew there ye haue V. C. yere of Pardon. The forth aulter is of owr Lady, there is Vii. C. yere of Pardon. The v. aulter is of Saint Leoo, there he receyuid the absolucion in his Masse fro hevyn, and there is Vii. C. yere of Pardon. The vi aulter of all Souls and there is V.

And there lyeth the bodys of dyvers oder ho∣ly persones which were too long to write off. And so the grace that is at Saint Sebastians is groundyd that it can not be taken away. Item, in the Chirche of saynt Mary Mayor afore writen, afore the quyer is the ymage of our lady whiche seint Luke did peynt; which ymage seynt Gregory dyd bere from Mary Mayor to Saint Peters th'apostle, also comyng afore the castell of Saint Aungell, he see an Aungell in the hyght of the ca∣stell, havyng in his honde a burninge sworde, and with hym a gret multy∣tude of Aungels, whiche songe afore that ymage▪ Regina celi letare, &c. answering saynt Gregory. Ora pro nobis Deum Alleluia. Item, in the Chirche of saint Iohn Latryneus, the Pope Siluestre yas therto as many yere of pardon, as it reyned droppes of water the day that halowed the Chirche. And that tyme it reyned so sore, that noo man had seen a greater rayne before that day. And whan he had graunted this, he thought in hym selfe whedyr he had so much power or not. Then ther came a voyce from heuen, and sayd Siluestre thou hast power inough to yeue that pardon and god graunted thus moche therto; That and a man had made a vowe too Iherusalem and lacked good to doo his pilgramage yf he go from saint Peters Chirch to saint Iohn Latrynes he shal be discharged and haue absolucyon of that promise. And ony tyme that a man cometh to saint Iohn Latrynes, he is quitt of all synnes and of all penaunce, with that, that he be penitent for his synnes. Blyssed is the moder that bereth the chylde that heryth Masse on Satur∣dayes at saint Iohn Latrynes, for he delyvaryd all theym that he desyreth out of Purgatory too the nombre of lxxvii soules. Item, vpon the tour of the Chirch stondyth a double crosse that was made of the swerde that saint Iohn was beheded with, and at euery tyme that a man beholdith that crosse he hath xiiii M. yere of pardon, and as ma∣ny karynes of all penaunce. And at the high auter ye haue remishion of all sinnes, and of all penance and innumerable pardon more then he nedeth for hymselfe. There ys the graue that seynt Iohn layd hym selfe in whan he had sayd masse, and than come a gret lyght ouer the graue, and whan that light was goon than funde they noo tynge there but hevynly bred. In that graue co∣meth euery good Fryday in the night ye holy creame and oyle, and he that putteth therein his hed hath an CM. yere of pardon, and as many karyns. And behynde the high auter stondith a cheyr which God sat in, and whoo that sitteth therein hath the iii parte of alle hys synnes relesyd.

And also the tables of stone with the x Commandementys that our Lorde yaf to Moyses vpon the mount of Synai; And ther ys a iiii square of the v barley loues and of the twoo fishes, and also there is our ladyes keuyrchef. Item, in that same Chirche on the hygh aulter be the hedys of seynt Pe∣ter and Poule, and the hed of Zacharie the Prophet, fader of S. Iohn Baptist wyth dyuers odyr reliquys. Item, in the same Chirchyard stondith a chapel that ys callid Sanctum Sanctorum, there is the face of our Lord; there may ye haue xiiii M. yere of pardon, and as many karynes. Whan the Emperour Constantyne was christened tho spake he to Pope Siluestre: In that, that I have geuen my hous to the wurschip of god, graunt you mekely his grace to all them that willingly come to this towne. Thoo answerd Pope Siluestre, our Lord Ihu Criste that by his gret mercy hath purged you of your gret lazarye he mut purge alle them that visityth this Chyrch of all her synne and of all other penance. He that woll not beleue this may goo to seynt Latrynes before the quyer dore, and there he may see in a marbill all that is wryten here. From seynt Iohns day vnto Scrouetyd all this pardon is doubled, and fro Scrouetide vnto Ester the pardon is threfolde double; Blessyd is he that may deserve to have this pardon. And in the same chapel abouesaid may come noo weemen. Item, aboue that chapel on the lefre syde ar stoppys which sometyme ware at Iherusalem; and who so goth op tho steppys on his knees, he deli∣uerith o soul out of Purgatory. Item, in the Chirch of Seynt Eustace you may have relyse and pardon of all synne. And he that is shreuen and repentant of his sinne he hath a M. yere par∣don, and as many karynes. My Author hauing spoken of the Indulgences and priuiledges granted to these principall Churches, and the great benefit which deuout pilgrimes receiue which come to visit these sacred structures, and highly reuerence the holy reliques therein contained, he proceeds in this place (according to his promise) to giue his Reader knowledge what a karyne is. A karyne (saith he) is too goo wulward vii yere. Item to fasten bred and watter the Fryday vii yere. Item, in vii yere not too slepe oon nyght there he slepith a nother. Item, in vii yere not to com vndir noo couered place, but yf it bee to here Masse in the Chirch dore or porche. Item in vii yere nott to ete nor drynke out of noo vessel, but in the same that he made hys avow in. Item, he that fulfillyth all thes poyntis vii yere duryng; doth and wynnethe a karyne, that ys to sey a Lentdum. Thus may a man haue at Rome (as he concludes) gret pardon and Soul helth; blessyd ben thoos pepull and yn good tyme borne that reslayyeth thes graces, and well kepith them. Of the which pardon and grace, our Lord Ihesu Cryst mot grant to euery good Crysten man. Amen. Then follow the Indulgences granted to other lower Churches in Rome: but by these you may imagine the rest. And by both iudge of the Pardons granted by seuerall Popes to the Cathedrall, Conuentuall, and Pa∣rochiall Churches of England. And thinke what concourse of pilgrimes and other people daily visited the foresaid Churches; which will hereafter appeare within each seuerall Diocesse. And here giue me leaue a little to speake of a certaine generall Pardon or Indulgence granted by Alexander the sixth, Bishop of Rome, to this Realme of England. By which he enriched himselfe, and the Church-Mi∣nisters, and emptied the purses of many of the Kings subiects. Towards the latter end of the yeare, one thousand fiue hundred, being the yeare of Iubile (so called, for that it is the yeare of ioy or deliuerance) the foresaid Bishop of Rome sent hither to King Henry the seuenth, one Iasper Powe or Pons, The great par∣don, or Hea¦uenly Grace. a Spaniard, a man of excellent learning, and most ciuill behauiour, to distribute the Heauenly Grace (as hee termed it) to all such as (letted by any forcible impediment) could not come to Rome that yeare to the Iubile which was there celebrated. The Articles contained in the Bul of this great Pardon, or Heauenly Grace, were as followeth. The Articles of the Bulle of the holy Iubiley of full remissyon, Copied out of an old Roll, now in the cu∣stody of Sir Sy∣mon D'Ewes Knight. and gret ioy graunted to the Relme of Englond, Wales, Irelond, Gernesey, and Garnesey, and other places vndre the subiection of oure Soueraygne Lord King Henry the seuenth to be distributyd accordyng to the trew meanyng of our holy Fader vnto the Kyngs Subiects. Ower most holye Fader the Pope, Goddes Vicar in erthe, of hys holye and gracyous disposycion, faderla beholdyng the hole flok of christen peple comitted to hys cure and charge, daylie studyeth diligently the helth and welfar of yowr sowles: And in as moche as in his holynes prouydeth for all soche perelles and ieoperdies as may fall to the same, by grauntyng of gret Indulgence, and remishyon of synnes and trespasses. Where as the holye yere of grace now of late passyd, that ys to say, the yere of remishyon of all synnes, ye yere of ioye and gladnes, was celebrate devowtely, and solenly keped, by grete and infenite nombre of Cristen pe∣pull in the Cowrte of Rome. Ower saide most holie Fader the Pope, as well consideryng the infenite nombre of cristen peple bothe spyrituall and tem∣porall which was desirous to haue had the sayd remishyon and Grace, and wold haue visetted the sayd Cowrte of Rome, saue only that they were lette, eyther by sikenesse, feblenesse, pouerte, long distance, and gret ieoperdie; or besines and charges of spirituall or temporall occupacions, or at that tyme purposed not to optaine and perchase the sayd Grace, and now be in will and desire to haue the same. As willyng, and effectually desiring to pro∣uyde and withstond the most cruell purpose, and infenyte malice of our most cruell enemyes of our cristen feithe the Turks whiche continually stu∣dieth, and gretely inforceth hymselfe with alle hys myght and strenght to subuert and vtterly destroye the holye Religion of our Souerayne Criste. As it is nott vnknowen how now of late, the sayd most cruell enemy hath opteyned and goten with grete myght and power many and dyuers grete citees and castles; As Modon, Neopo ton, and Corona, with many oder Townes and possessions which was than in the dominatyon and possession of cristen peple. And most cruelly hath sleyne and estroyed infenite nom∣bre of cristen peple withowt mercy or pite, bothe by water and by londe. Seeyng and consideryng his Holynes, that he of hymselfe is not sufficyent, ne of power to resiste, and withstonde the forsayd gret malyces, and porpo∣ses, without the ayde and helpe of cristen peple; Hath statu ed, ordeyned, and graunted of his Pastorall power, as is conteyned in thes Articles fol∣lowing. Furst ower soueraigne Lorde Kyng Herry the seuenth, with all his pro∣geny; all Archebusschoppes, Busschoppes, Abbotts, Dukes, Erles, Barons, Knygtes, Squyers, Gentillmen, yomen, cetezines, and Strangers▪ and all oder cristen peple, both men and women, what oder degre, or condicyon soeuer thei be, of spyrituall or temporall, seculer, or reguler, dwellyng, or for a tyme abydyng within the Relme of Englond, Irelond, Wales, Gernesey or Garn∣sey, or any oder place vndre the rewle or dominacion of our sayd soueraigne Lorde the Knyge, which att any time after the publycation herof, to the last Euensong of the Octaues of Ester next commynge, truely confessyd and contryte visite soche Chorches as shall be assigned to be vesited; by the ryght reuerent Fader in God Gasper Powe Prothonotarie, and Doctor of Diuinite, of our sayd holy Fader, the Popes Imbassator, and in this holy Iu∣beley Commissarie, or by oder by hym substituted or deputed; and ther put into the chest for thentent ordeyned, soche somme or quantite of money, gold, or siluer, as is lymytted and taxed here folowyng in the last end of this paper; to be spent for the defence of ower feithe; shall have the same Indul∣gence, Pardon, and Grace with remissyon of all ther sinnes, whiche thei shuld have had, if thei had gone personally to Rome in the yere of Grace, and ther vesited all the Chorches assigned for that entent, both within the cite and without, and alsoo done all oder things required to have be done ther for the obteyning of the said grace of the ubeley. Also our said holy Fader hath gevyn full power and auctorite to his said Commissarie and his Deputis to che e and assigne Confessours and Peni∣tenciers seculer and reguler in all soche places as shall please the said Com∣missarie or his Deputies; to here the confessions of all soche as are desposed to receyue the Pardon of this holy Iubeley.

And also the falsaries of the Popes Bulls, and of oder wrytings passing from the Courte of Rome: of the sellers or conveyers of Harneys, or oder things prohibited to the hethen peple. And of thes that laieth violente bondes on Busschoppes, or oder Prelates of the Chirche, which be above Busschoppes. And the said Confessours shall haue power to geue and graunte to all the said persones confessyd and contrite, clene and full remission whiche is called, A pena et culpa. Also the said Confessours and Penitenciers shall have power and aucto¦rite to dispence and change all manner of vowes into alm sdede for the de∣fence of our Feith, none except, though itt be to Rome, to Iherusalem, or to Seint Iames. Also our said holy Fader willing no man to be excluded from this grete Grace and Indulgence, hath graunted, that all soche as be seke and impo∣tente, or oderwyse deseased so that * yei may not easly visitte the Chorches assigned to be visetted, shall have for them and all ther howsholde the sayd Indulgence, Remissyon and Grace, as well as if they did visitte the sayd Chorches. Furst compownding effectually with the sayd Commissarie, or his Deputies for the same. Also itt ys graunted by our sayd holy Fader that all thos that were at Rome this last yere of Grace shalbe parteable and capax of this sayd Grace and Pardon, yt thei will receive itt. Also our sayd holy Fader hath graunted to his said Commissarie, and his substitutes full power to interpretate, and declare, all soche doubts as may be fownde, or be moved in thies his graunts, or in the execucion of the same, or any parte ther of, willyng and commandyng that ther interpreta∣tyon shall effectually be taken and stond. Also our said holy Fader hath straitly commanded, in the vertue of obe∣dience, and vndre the payne of cursyng, the sentence in that behalfe gevin; of the whiche they may nott be assoyled, but of the Pope himself, furst sa∣tisfaccion made with the sayd Commissarie, or his Depute after the qualite of the trespas. That none ordinary seculer, or reguler, or any oder persones seculer or reguler, lett his Bulles or any oder writyngs made for declaracion her of, to be published in their Chorches, Citees, or Diocesses, wher or whan itt shalbe nedefull; nor that thei shall aske or receyve though itt be offered any money or oder reward, for the publicacion or sufferance therof, or any otherwyse lett or hynder thexpedicion therof, and goodspeede of the seid Indulgence; or persuade directly or indirectly any person to with∣drawe their good mynd or porpose in that behalfe.

The Articles of the Bull of dispensacyon with Simony, Vsury, and of goodes wrongfully keped; reserued to the Commissary only. Moreouer ower seid holy Fader the Pope willynge more largely to pro∣uide for the helth and welfar of the sowles of all cristen pepull dwellyng or abyding in the Relme and places aboue written; hath geuen, and graunted, full auctorite, and power, to the sayd Venerable Fader in God, Gaspar Pow his Orator and Commissary, to absolue, and dispence with all manner of persones, dwellyng or abidyng within the seyd Relme, or places aboue re∣hersyd, men or wemen, of what degre or condicyon so euer thei be, spiry∣tuall or temporall, seculer or reguler, whiche hath commytted Symony, in gevyng or recevyng holy Orders, or Benefices spiritual or any other wai s; that thei may, notwithstondyng the seyd Simony so commyttid ministre in the orders so receyved: And the Benefices so obteyned lawfully kepe and occupye, and the frutes or to be receyved, occupie and despose at their plesure. And yf the seyd persones by reason therof have runne into irregu∣larite; as ther apon syngyng Masse, or oder wyse ministryng the holy Sa∣cramentys of the Chirche: The seyd Commissary hath full power to des∣pence with that irregularite; and to take away all infamye and vnablenes whiche thei be in by reason of the same. Alway prouyded that the seyd persones make a composytyon herof with the seyd Commissarie, and soche money as thei compownd for, effectually to pay to the seyd Commissarie, to be spent in this holy vse for the relefe and defence of our feith. Also the seyd Commissarie hath power to compownd, absolue, and dis∣pence with all thos that occupye evill goten goods; all vsurers, and all soche that wrongfully and vnlefully occupieth or witholdeth oder mennys goods by fyndyng; or goods hidde not knowyng, or dowtyng who be the owners of the seyd goods, or to whom thei shulde mak restitucyon, that thei lefully kepe, and occupie the same goods. Furst makyng composycyon for the same with the seyd Commyssarie, of some certeyne summe of mo∣ney to be spent in the foreseyd holy vse, that is to sey, for the relefe and de∣fence of ower Feith, ayenst the most cruell and bitter enemys of the same, the Turkes. Also yf ther be any willing to be created Doctour in both Lawes, or in one of them; the seyd Commissarie hath power to doe it, as well as if he were created in any Vniuersitie: And so of oder degrees, &c. Also this Pope by his Buls imparted this his blessing and benefit of the Iubeley to all other kingdomes and territories vnder his spirituall Iuris i∣ction and obeysance, and to all in like manner, and vpon the like condicions. By which you may gather, that this beneuolent liberalitie of pardon and heauenly Grace, was not altogether freely giuen by the Pope; neither was that masse of money, thus co gested together, spent in any warres against the Turkes, as he promised; but conueied to Rome, and there laid vp in his owne Treasurie: whilest the enemies of the faith did greatly infest the Chri∣stians. But this Pope of all other, in my iudgement, had the most shamefull and cunning shif s to get money withall, and was more opprobrious in all his actions then any other either before or since. But as he liued wickedly, so hee died miserably, being poysoned with the same bane which hee had prepared for another. Actius Sannazarius, and other writers of that age made certaine Epitaphs of him to his eternall in amie. Which I finde thus translated into English, out of Io. Bale in his Pageant of Popes. Perhaps whose Tombe this is (my friend) ye do not know, Then pause a while if that ye haue no haste to go. Though Alexanders name vpon the stone be grauen, Tis not that great, but he that late was Prelate shorne and shauen. Who thirsting after bloud, deuour'd so many a noble Towne, Who tost and turn'd the ruthfull states of kingdomes vpside downe. Who to enrich his sonnes, so many Nobles slew, And wast the world with fire and sword and spoyling to him drew. Defying lawes of earth and heauen, and God himselfe erewhile, So that the sinfull Father did the Daughters bed defile. And could not from the bands of wicked wedlock once refrayne, And yet this pestilent Prelate did in Rome tenne yeeres remaine.

Now may it please you reade certaine blanke verses taken out of my fore remembred Author, Piers Plow man, who speakes in his language of the Pope and Cardinals, Pardons and pilgrimages effectually to this purpose. Passus 19. God amend the Pope, that pilleth holy Kirke And claymeth before the Kyng to be kept of Christen Of the Pope. And counteth not though cristen be killed and robbed And fynd folke to fight, and christen folk to spill. Agayne the old law and new law as Paule therof wytnesseth. Non occides, mihi vindictam, &c. I ne knew neuer Cardinall that he ne come fro the Pope, And we Clarks when they come for her Commens payen, Of the Car∣dinal For her pelures, and palfreis, and pilors that hem folow.

In the seuenth passage he deliuers his opinion of the Popes Pardons, in these words. The Prieste preued no pardon to do well, And demed that Dowell Indulgence passed Biennales and Triennales, and Byshops letters And how Dowell at the day of dome is dignely vndersongen, And passed all the Pardon of S. Peters Church. A little after in the same passage, thus.

Pilgrimage, is called of the Latines, Peregrinatio, quasi peregre abitio, a going into a strange countrey; for a short pilgramage is not worth a pin: neither is that Image in so much honour or respect in that countrey where it is, as in farre countries. For example, the Italians, yea those that dwell neare Rome, will mocke and scoffe at our English (and other) pilgrims that go to Rome to see the Popes holinesse, and Saint Peters chaire, and yet they themselues will runne to see the Reliques of Saint Iames of Compostella in the kingdome of Galicia in Spaine, which is aboue twelue hundred English miles. And so the Spaniards hold Rome to be a very holy place, and there∣fore spare no cost or labour to go thither. And so of other pilgrimages. Pilgrimage was also called Romeria, quia Romam vt plurimum peregri∣nationes, because pilgrimages forth most part were made to Rome. Now hauing acquainted my Reader (omitting many particulars, I con∣fesse, which will more plainly appeare in the sequele) by what deuises and meanes, the Religious Votaries and others of the Clergie within this king∣dome, as also the Bishop of Rome (who most commonly went away with the best share) augmented their reuenues, and deceiued the poore Com∣mons. I am here to speake of a yearely tribute paied onely to the See of Rome (which many times I obuiously meete withall) from the payment whereof, neither the King nor the Clergie, nor any housholder in England or Ireland were priuiledged, and this was called which is a Saxon word compounded of Rome and Scot, as you wou d say, the bute due to Rome, or an Apostolicall custome, or the see of penning, or Denarij Sancti Petri, Peter pence: From which payment Mathew the Monke of Westminster, neither the King, nor the Archbi∣shop, Bishop, Abbot, nor Prior, were exempted. I he first ounder of Tribute was Inas, or Ina, king of the West-saxons. Of which the foresaid Mathew thus writes. Ina the pious and potent king of the West Saxons, lea ing his tempo¦rall kingdome (thereby to gaine an eternall) to the gouernment of his kins∣man Ethelard, trauel ed on pilgrimage to Rome, where in the said Citie by the permission of Gregory the second, hee built an house which he called, The English Schoole; vnto which, the kings of England, and the Regall Image, as also Bishops, Priests, Clerkes, and others might repaire, to ee instructed in good literature, and in the Catholicke faith; lest that any thing in the English Church might be sin ste ly expounded contrary to the vni∣uersall vnitie, and so, being established in the orthodoxall and right recei∣ued Faith, they might returne backe againe into their owne countrey. For the doctrine and Schooles of the English Nation since the time of Arch¦bishop Austin, had beene interdicted by diuers Romish Bishops, for cer∣taine heresies which daily appeared after the comming in of the Saxons in∣to Britaine, by reason of the commixture of the misbeleeuing wicked Pa¦gans, with the Christians of holy conuersation. Hee also caused a Church to be erected neare to the foresaid house or Colledge, which he dedicated to the honour of the blessed Virgine Mary ; in which such of the English as came to Rome might celebrate d uine Seruice, and that therein, if any of the said English there happened to depart this world, they might be in er∣red. And all these, that they might for euer be more firmly corroborated, it was ordained by a generall decree, throughout all the kingdome of the West-Saxons, that in euerie familie one pennie should be yearely collected and sent ouer to blessed Saint Peter and the Church of Rome, which in Eng¦lish Saxons was called Romescot; that the English there abiding mig t by that meane haue sufficient to liue vpon. Thus a re Mathew of Westminste surnamed the Flower-gatherer. The which in substance is thus deliuer d by a late writer, yet in a different manner. He (meaning Ina ) instituted also a certaine yearely payment to the See of Rome, enioyning euery one of his Subiects that posses ed in his house of one kinde of goods to the value of twentie pence, that he should pay a p ny to the Pope yearely vpon Lammas day; which at that time was contributed vnder the name of the Kings Almes, but afterwards was called and chal∣lenged by the name of Peter-pence. Another of the same gift by the said King hath these times. He gaue to Rome eche yere The Rome pence thorrow West sex all about Perpetually to be well payd and clere, For vnto Rome he went without all doubt. After the example, and with the like zeale of Ina, Offa the most magnifi∣cent king of the Mercias, in great deuotion went also to Rome, and made euery house within his territories subiect to this payment of Romescot; Hand. cap. 133. Ossa gaue through Mers the Rome penny Vnto the Church of Rome. Afterwards about the yeare eight hundred and fiftie, this tribute was confirmed, and made further payable throughout all England; For Ethel∣wolfe (as then being sole Monarch of the Englishmen; (hauing beene some∣times for certaine yeares (as Haneden and Brampton write) Bishop of Win∣chester) remembring his Ecclesiasticke profession; and ordaining first that tithes and lands due to holy Church should be free from all tributes and Regall seruices; in the nineteenth yeare of his raigne, with the like deuotion of the two former kings, went in pilgrimage, taking with him his youngest sonne Alfred, or Elfred, to the foresaid chiefe Citie of the Romanes; where he was both honourablie receiued and entertained by the Bishop of Rome and the whole Senate, for the space of one yeare and vpwards: in which time he rebuilt the English Schoole before remembred, which lately had beene almost quite consumed with fire. And in lieu of his kinde entertain∣ment, confirmed the former grant of Peter-pence, causing it to bee payed throughout all his Dominions; and further couenanted to pay yearely to Rome three hundred Markes, thus to be employed; one hundred to Saint Peters Church, another hundred to Saint Pauls light, and the third to the Pope (a Saint that euermore will haue his share) to the entent, saith one, that no Englishmen should doe penance in bounds, as he saw some do be∣fore his face. This Athilwolfe to Rome toke his way In pilgramage with him his sonne Aelfrede, To Peter and Pole he graunted infenitife The Rome pence of all Englond. As Flores saith as I con vnderstond. Saith Harding, cap. 105. And further to confirme the premisses, may it please you to trouble your patience in the reading of these following hard rimes transcribed out of a namelesse old Author.

Thrugh al hys myght in al hys noble lond, The Pece he kepte, and in his Se iudicyall The common Law among hys peple all. Edgar king of England made sharpe constitutions for the payment of this Tribute. And it was one of the lawes of Edward the Confessour, that euery house∣holder which had triginta denariatas viuae pecuniae in domo sua de proprio suo, Thirtie pence of ready money, or of any kinde of cattell in his house of his owne proper, should by the Law of the English giue a pennie to Saint Peter, and by the Law of the Danes halfe a marke; which pennie was to be demanded at or vpon the feast of Saint Peter and Paul, and to be collect∣ed before the feast of Saint Peter ad vincula, and not to be deferred to any further day: And if any withheld the payment thereof any longer time, complaint was to be made to the Kings Officers, for that this penny was the Kings Almes. And that the partie so offending, should hee constrained by iustice to make payment thereof, on paine of forfeiting his goods. Now if any man had more dwelling houses then one, hee was to pay onely for that house where he should happen to be resiant, at the said feast of Saint Peter and Paul. Henry the second vpon his conquest of Ireland, imposed this tribute vpon that kingdome, onely to curry fauour with the Pope, who as then was Adrian the fourth, called before his inthronization, Nicholas Breake∣speare, borne at Abbots Langley in Hertfordshire. For hee (saith Speed in the life of the said Henry ) knowing how great and dangerous tumults the Popes had raised vpon small occasions, thought his way would bee much easier, if he went onward with the Popes good fauour, which he easily ob∣tained for a fee, viz. a penny yearely to bee payed to Saint Peter of euerie house in Ireland. Edward the third in the 39. yeare of his raigne (saith Treuisa the Con¦tinuer of Polychronicon) ordained, that this Tribute of Peter pence, should not be from thenceforth any more gathered within this Realme, nor any such payment made at Rome. But howsoeuer (saith Hollinshed in the said yeare) this payment was abrogated at this time, by King Edward, it was after rene ed againe by the Pope, and the money was gathered in certaine Shires of this Realme, vntill the dayes of king Henry the eighth. Parsons, and Impropriators of Churches, at this day in many places of England, are payed this pennie vnder the name of a Smoke pennie. This Chapter is growne much longer then I expected. Of which an end. CHAP. XVIII. Of Parishes, Bishoprickes Of the power and sanctitie of Bishops and Priests. Of Sanctuaries, and of the Eccles asticall state of England and Wales. Angel. . PArochia dicit r locus in quo degit populus alicui Ecclesiae baptismali de∣putatus, & certis finibus limitatus. A Parish is said to bee a place in which people doe hue assigned to some Christian Church, and limited by certaine bounds. Euaristus the first, Bishop of Rome, who suffered martyrdome vnder Traian the Emperour, about the yeare of our redemption, one hundred and ten, ordained Curates, and disposed of them to certaine places, that they might administer the Sacraments to such people as were committed to their charge; and withall he ordained that these Curates should bee nou∣rished and maintained by those people of whose soules they had the cure; whereupon they were called, Parochi à prebenco, vel à mu∣tua alimentorum praebitione, Parochians, or Parishioners of the mutuall ex∣hibition, and giuing of nourishment one to another; the Priest for the soules of his people, and the people for the maintenance of their Priest. Dionisius, that blessed Martyr, Bishop of Rome, circa ann. 266. did at∣tempt to doe the like throughout the whole Christian world, appointing by distribution certaine places, to which he assigned Ecclesiasticall persons, there to administer the Sacraments, pray, and preach the word, and to re∣ceiue the tenths of the possessions contained within the limits of the fore∣said places. Honorius Archiepiscopus Cantuar▪ circa annum à salute reparata 636. Angliam primus in Parochias distribuere cepit. Honorius Archbishop of Canterbury, about the yeare of our saluation, 636. began first to diuide England into Parishes. . cap. 9. But this opinion is controuerted by a late learned Antiquary, and by him plainly approued, that Honorius was not the first that made this diuision here in England, but that Parishes were diuided, and Parish-Churches built long before his time; euen in the Primitiue Hierarchie of the Britaine . And that in the time of King Arthur, about the yeare of our Lord 490 when Dubritius was made Archbishop of South Wales, diuers Churches with their endowments of Tithes, oblations, and other profits, were appro∣priated to him the said Dubritius, and his successours. And that in those times Churches were built here no doubt can bee made. Neither is it to be conceiued how Christianitie could be in any nation, saith my Author, much ancienter (if generally receiued, or by any number) then Churches, or some conuenient houses, or other places in the nature of Churches, ap¦pointed for the exercise of deuotion. And expresse mention is made of a Church (of which I haue spoken before) built in Canterbury in the time of the Romanes, to the honour of Saint Martin, in which Augustine and his followers when they came first from Rome, made their holy assem∣blies. After that the stormes of Diocletians persecution were ouerblowen, saith Bede, Lib. 1. cap . which was circa Ann. 290. the faithfull Christians, who in time of danger lay hid in dennes and deserts, came forth, and shewed themselues abroad, renewed their Churches, which before were ouerthrowne flat to the ground, founded, builded, and perfited new Temples, in honour of the holy Martyrs, celebrated holy dayes, consecrated the holy mysteries, with pure mouth and heart, and euery where as it were displayed their en∣signes in signe of Conquest. Aliquindo Parochia dicitur totus Episcopatus, Sum. Angl. lit. P. Will. Malms. degest. Pont. l. 1. saith one, and Parochia etiam Dioecesis Episcopalis dicitur, saith another. Sometime a Parish is said to be the whole Bishopricke, and sometime the Episcopall Diocesse. Kenwalch King of the West-Saxons, diuided, In duas Parochias Pra n∣ciam ; the Prouince into two Parishes, or Diocesses, when as he erected a new Bishopricke at Winchester, taken out of the Diocesse of Dorchester, a ruinous Towne now in Oxfordshire. In the yeare 680. Merciorum Prouincia in quinque Parochias est diuisa: The Prouince of Mercia was diuided into fiue Parishes, that is, into fiue Bishopricks; and thus Honorius may be said properly to haue beene the first vnder whom his Prouince was diuided into such Parishes or Bishop∣rickes. Anno Dom. 747. in the raigne of Ethelbald, Will. Malms. de gest. Pont. lib. king of the Mercians, in a Synod holden at Clouesho, it was decreed, Vt singuli Episcopi omni anno Parochias suas circumirent: That euery Bishop should go about or visit his Parishes once euery yeare. And in the first Synod or Conuocation of the English Church, Bed. l 4. ca. 5. holden at Hereford, Ann. 670, it was determined, Vt nullus Episcoporum Parochi∣am alterius inuadat, sed contentus sit gubernatione creditae sihi plebis: That no Bishop should haue ought to do in anothers Parish, but bee contented with the charge of the people committed vnto him. Kenulph, Will. Malms. de g stis Reg li. 1. c. 4. King of the Mercians, in his Epistle to Leo the third, Bishop of Rome, writes, Quod contra Canones à Patre Gregorio constitut as auctoritas Dorobernensis Metropolitani in duas scinditur Parochias, cuius ditioni duo decim subiacere debent Episcopi. That contrary to the Canons of Saint Gre∣gory the iurisdiction of the Metropoliticall See of Canterbury was diuided into two Parishes, to whose authoritie twelue Bishops ought to be subiect. To which point of his Epistle, Leo makes this answer. In sacro scrinio nostro reperimus, sanctum Gregorium Predecessorem nostrum in integro ipsam Pa∣rochiam numero duodecim beato Augustino Archiepiscopo tradidisse Epis copos consecrandos. We finde in our sacred Cabinet, our Predecessour Saint Gregory, to haue giuen and deliuered that Parish to blessed Augustine en∣tire and whole, with the number of twelue Bishops by him to bee conse∣crated. These great Parishes or Bishoprickes were not made Diocesses or Iuris∣dictions together, straight from the first budding of Christianitie, but in succession of time, as the number of Christians did increase, and as the true faith was spread abroad. For some Churches were vnder the charge of Cu∣rates, other some of Abbots, and of these were made these great Parishes or Bishopricks. The dignitie and gouernment of which was appointed to learned and religious men, which did diligently ouersee, like good Shep∣heards, the flocks committed to their charge, and these were called Bi∣shops. Numma. Angelica lit. E. Episcopus Grece, latine speculator interpretatur, speculari enim debet mores & vitia populi sibi subiecti & intendere ad eorum salutem. A Bishop both in Greeke and Latine, signifies a beholder, or a Scoute▪ watch, for he ought to behold and ouersee the manners, conditions, and vices of the people li∣uing vnder his gouernment, and to vse the best meanes hee can for their soules health. Iliad. lib. 15. Homer calls Hector suum Episcopum, because he was precipuus Troiae in∣spector et propugnator, the chiefe ouerseer and defender of the Citie of Troy. Amb. in Pasto∣ al . Nihil in hoc seculo excellentius sacerdotibus, nihil sublimius Episcopis re∣periri potest. Nothing in this age more excelling then Priests, nothing more sublime and high then Bishops can be found. The power and holinesse of Priests and Bishops. Honor et sublimitas Episcopalis nullis poterit comparationibus adaequari. The Episcopall honour and dignitie can be equalled by no comparisons. Id. in Pastoral. Id. Ibid. Esto subiectus Pontifici tuo et quasi parentem animae tuae ama. Be subiect to thy Bishop, and loue him as the father and nourisher of thy soule. Augustine in li. de pastoribus. Nihil est in bac vita, et maxime hoc tempore difficilius, laboriosius, et peri∣culosius Episcopi aut Presbyteri officio, sed apud Deum nihil beatius, si eo mo∣do militetur quo noster Imperator iubet. Nothing in this life, and specially at this time more difficult, laborious, and perillous then the office of a Bi∣shop or Priest, but before Almightie God no office more blessed; if they fight and make warre after the same manner as they bee commanded by their Captaine our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ. Hebr. . Omnis Pontifex (saith Saint Paul ) ex hominibus assumptus, pro homini∣bus constituitur in ijs qui sunt ad Deum, vt offerat dona et sacrificia pro pec∣catis. Euery Bishop or high Priest, is taken from among the men, and is or∣dained for men in things pertaining to God, that hee may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sinnes. Corinth. 3. Corinth. 4. They are Gods labourers, Gods husbandrie, and Gods buildings. Let a man so thinke of them, as of the Ministers of Christ, and disposers of the secrets of God. Lib. 1. What is more pleasant (saith William the Monke of Malmesbury in his Prologue to the Acts of our English Bishops) then to rehearse the praise of our ancient Bishops; that thou mayest know the deeds of them of whom thou hast receiued the rudiments of Faith, and the incitements to a godly life. No nation of the world, saith Capgraue, in the Prologue to his Cata∣logue of English Saints, Io Cap hath from the beginning beene so blest with holy, learned, and religious Bishops as England, whose sanctitie did so shine, that all which saw them and their good workes, assuredly knew, that they were the seed, to whom God had imparted his blessings: their conuersation and studie being alwayes about heauenly matters. As the rod of Aaron did bud and blossome, Numb. . and bring forth ripe Al∣monds, so the Church and Ministery of England, by the meanes of our reuerend Bishops, as of Gods sacred instruments, did (and still doth) pro∣sper, flourish, and bring forth fruits of righteousnesse, to the glorie of God, and comfort of all true Christian hearts. Now before I conclude this point, Of the first in∣ of ishop . giue me leaue to speake a little further of the first institution of Bishops out of the booke of a namelesse Author, written in Latine about three hundred yeares since; translated into English by one William Marshall, and imprinted at London by one Robert Wyer, Ann. 1535 in the 27. of King Henry the eighth, the booke is called, The Defence of Peace. After the tymes of the Apostles, D fence of Pe ce. Chap. 1 . the nombre of Preestes beyng nota∣blye augmented, and increased (saith he) to avoyde sclaundre and occasyon of offendynge any man, and to avoyde scisme and dyvysion, the Preestes chose one among themselues, which shulde dyrecte and ordre the other, as touchynge to the exercysynge of the Ecclesiasticall offyce, or service, and the dystrybutyng of the oblacyons, and the dysposynge and orderynge of other thyngs in the most conuenient maner, N t . for our t s. leste yf euery man myght do this thinge after his owne pleasure, as he lest himselfe, the good ordre and servyce of the Churches myght be troubled, by the reason of the dyuerse affeccions of men. This Preeste whiche was so elected and chosen, to or∣dre and rule the other Preestes, by the custome and vsed maner of spea∣kynge of them that came afterwards, was onely called a Bysshop or ouer∣seer; because not onely he was ouerloker of the Christen people▪ for whiche cause all other Preests also were called Ouerseers in the Prymatyne Church; but also because he had the ouersyght of the other Preestes. Howsoeuer, saith he, in the same Chapter, in the essentyall and inseparable auctoryte and dygnyte of Preesthood; the Bysshops have no preheminence aboue other Preestes, but onely in auctoryte accydentall, being that the Bishop by the provydence of God is chosen (vpon the former reason) to have the rule and gouernment of the Clergie within his Diocesse: For in the power and auctoryte of makyng and admynystryng the Sacraments, and performing of other duties belonginge meerely to the Preesthood, all Preestes (saith he) have all one auctoryte in kynde: neyther the Bysshop of Rome, or any other Bysshop hath this auctoryte any whyt more largely, than any other hath who euer he be, beynge called a symple or pryvate Preest. And ther∣fore it is to be mervayled, wherfore some men do stryve styffely and fro∣wardly affyrmynge yet no thynge reasonably, that the Pope of Rome hath more large power of the keyes geuen to hym of Chryste than hath other Preestes, Euery Priest hath as much power in bind∣ing and loo∣sing as the Pope. seing that this cannot be proued by the holy Scrypture, but ra∣ther the contrary. For whiche thyngs, to go on with my Author, more euidently to be seene and perceyved, you ought to vnderstande and knowe, that these two wordes Presbyter, and Episcopus, that is to saye, Preest or senyour, and Bysshop, were both of one sygnyfycacion, and betokened all one thynge in the Prymatyue Church, albeit they were put to sygnyfy one thynge of diuers propertyes, for Presbyter was a name gyven to them of age, which is as moche to saye as a Senyour or Elder. And Episcopus was a name gyuen of cure or charge vpon other, and is as moche to say as an ouerloker, according to that of Saynt Iherom in a certayne Epystle to Euan∣dre, who sayth thus, Presbyter and Episcopus, the one is a name of age, the other of dygnyte. These dignified priests, I meane Bishops, euer since the Conquest, their chiefe seate or chaire in Cities, and their Churches haue, euer since the sunne-shine of the Gospell, beene called Cathedrall▪ and in respect they were more spatious then other inferiour Parish Churches, Camd. in Epis. D . they were tear∣med Basilicae, of which will it please you heare Camden speake. These grea∣ter Churches (saith hee) when the sauing light of Christ shone vpon the world were tearmed Basilicae, for that the Basilicae of the Gentiles which were large and spacious Hauls, wherein Magistrates sat in iudgement, and ministred iustice, were conuerted into Christian Churches. Whence Auso∣nius wrote thus. Basilica olim negotijs plena, &c. The Basilica (or Haul of Iustice) in times past full of businesses, is now as full of prayers and vowes: or else because they were built in forme somewhat long in manner of those Basilicae. But to returne backe againe to my Parishes, which are called Benefices for Ecclesiasticall persons, like as the preferments in Cathedrall Churches are tearmed Church Dignities: and of these, some are called Rectories, or Parsonages, some Vicaradges, as will appeare by the sequele. Parochia is sometime called Plebania, and thus defined. Sintagiutis lib 1 . cap. 24. Plebania est aliud genus beneficij, et maius quam Rectoria, habet sub se Capellas et dignitatem esse putant interpretes. Plebania is another kinde of Benefice, and of greater circuite then a Re∣ctorie; it hath vnder it certaine Chappels, and this Plebania, or dignitas ple∣beia is said to be a Church dignitie, by Interpretours. Questionlesse these Plebanians were like our side-wasted Parishes in Lan∣chishire, whose extensure is so large, that (to my owne knowledge) some one of those Parish Churches hath fourteene Chappels of ease (as we call them) within the circumference of her limits, The Parish of Whalley in Lanchishire. and as it were vnder her iu∣risdiction, all which are honoured with Parochiall rites. Cathedrall, Abbey and Parish Churches had great priuiledges of san∣ctuarie granted vnto them in former times. Sanctuaries . Now a Sanctuarie is a place of refuge for offenders to escape punishment. And these Sanctuaries were so called of an old Mosaicall rite vsed amongst the Israelites, among whom euery Tribe had certaine Cities, and places of refuge, to which malefa∣ctours might repaire, and for a time bee protected from the rigour of the Law. Of which you may reade in the sacred writ: Exod. 21.13. Numb. 35.1. Deuter. 4.41. and Iosh. 20.2. And so likewise here in great Britaine Churches, Church-yards, Cities, ploughs and high-wayes, had many pri∣uiledges in this kinde anciently granted and confirmed vnto them. I will speake first of the last out of a late Writer, who makes old Watling-streete thus to sing his verse. Since vs his kinglie waies Mulmutius first began From gaine o Sea, M. Dr yton oly l. Song 16. that through the Hand ran. Wh at in m nd to keepe Posteritie might haue, Appo nting ust his course, this priuiledge he gaue, That no man might arrest, or debtors goods might seize In any of vs foure his militarie waies. Neare fiue hundred yeares before this King Mulmutius (take it vpon the credit o the British Story) constituted diuerse lawes; Se de in his Illustrations vpon the verses. especially that Churches, Ploughs, and high wayes should haue liberties of Sanctuary, by no authoritie violable. That Churches should be free, and enioy liberty for refuge, consenting allowance of most Nations haue tollerated, and in this kingdome (it being affirmed also by constitution of King Lucius a Chri∣stian) euery Church yard was a Sanctuary, vntill by Act of Parliament vn∣der Hen. 8. that licence, for protection of offences, being too much abused, was taken away. Of Mulmutius Dunwallo (for so hee is sometime called) and his priui∣ledges to sacred places, my old Mss. thus further speakes. A kynge ther was in Brutayne Donw lle was his nam, Ro . Christ Stale worth, and hardy a man of grete fam. He ordeyned first yat theeues yat to Temple slown wer No man wer so hardy to do hem despit ther; That hath be moche suth yhold as hit begonne tho, Hely Chyrch hit holdyth yut and wole euer mo. Hereupon he called the Temples which hee built, the Temples of peace and concord: one of which was in London, where now Blackwell Hall is, another in Fleete-street, as yet called the Temple Church, wherein (or in some of them) himselfe, Gorbomannus, and other of the British kings, were interred, as by supposition it is deliuered. Lucius, Fl res. Hist. p . og de un. 183. king of the Britaines, hauing abundantly distributed and giuen ample possessions, and reuenues to Churches and Clergie men, ordained that Churches with their Coemiteries or Church-yards, should haue this priuiledge; that what malefactour soeuer should thither make flight for his safetie, he might there remaine without indemnitie. Ethelwolfe and Alfred Kings of the West-Saxons, gaue the like im∣portant priuiledges to these holy Edifices. Athelstane sole Monarch of the Englishmen, eg. A fr i. c. 5. held the memory of Iohn de Beuerley, Archbishop of Yorke, so sacred and reuerend (for he honored him as his urelar Saint) that he endowed Beuerley (the place of the said Arch∣bishops birth) with many, Camd. in Yorke∣shire. and those very great priuiledges, and granted them liberties in these generall words. As free make I thee As heart may think, or eie may see. Yea and there was granted vnto it the priuiledge of a Sanctuary, so that Bankrupts and men suspected of any capitall crime, worthy of death, might be free and safe there from the danger of the law; in which was erected a chaire of stone with this Inscription. This seat of Stone is called Freed stool, that is, the chaire of peace, vnto which what offender soeuer flieth, and commeth, hath all manner of Se∣curitie. Of the Sanctuary at Westminster, first granted by Sebert King of the East-Saxons, encreased by Edgar King of the West-Saxons, and confirmed by the Charter of King Edward the Confessor, I haue spoken before. In Leg. Will. Con. Reg. de Houeden. If any one guilty of offence flie from any place for refuge to the Church, Church-doore, to the Parson or Vicars house, or into any part of his base or inner Court (prouided that the said house and courts bee within conse∣crated ground) it shall not be lawfull for any to take him from thence, saue onely the Bishop or some of his Officers. Now if this malefactour bee a filching knaue, or an high-way robber, and be taken with the bootie, or if his theeuish purchase be altogether exhausted and spent, yet if he haue any meanes otherwayes of his owne, he shall make satisfaction to the partie, or parties whom hee hath so wronged; and if hee still continue to play the thiefe, and make a custome of this manner of flight to Churches and Priests houses, after restitution made, he shall abiure the countrey; and if he giue not satisfaction to the parties, whose goods hee hath taken and purloyned, no man shall dare to giue him lodging or entertainment, without the kings speciall licence first obtained. Bracton sol. 132 If a Clergie-man bee taken for felonie, deliuered to the Ordinarie, and breake prison, and flie to the Church for sanctuarie or refuge, he shall bee taken from thence, and put into the same prison out of which he escaped; for the Church ought not to defend him, nor any publike malefactour, Si ad pacem Regis venire noluerit. But stay, for if robbing from other mens works, to embellish my owne writings, be an offence, it is high time for mee to take Sanctuarie: yet giue me leaue to go a little further in my course, and to speake somewhat, out of other Authors, of the Ecclesiasticall state of England, of which you may reade more at large in Camden his diuision of Britaine, and know more by Speed in his Type of this flourishing kingdome. Sir Edward C ke in his Comment. vp∣on Littleton. lib. 2. cap. 6. The Ecclesiasticall state of England is diuided into two Prouinces or Archbishopricks; viz. of Canterbury, and of Yorke. The Archbishop of Canterbury s stiled, Metropolitanus et Primas totius Angliae ; and the Archbishop of Yorke, Primas Angliae. The Archbishop of Canterbury hath vnder him within his Prouince, of ancient and late foundations. Ro∣chester his principall Chaplaine; London his Deane; Winchester his Chancellour, and all the rest of the Bishopricks, foure excepted, viz. Che∣ster, Durham, Carlile, and the Ile of Man, which are annexed to the Arch∣bishopricke of Yorke. Euery Diocesse is diuided into Archdeaconries, and the Archdeacon is called Oculus Episcopi, The eye of the Bishop. And euery Archdeaconrie is parted into Deanries, and Deanries againe into Parishes, Townes, and Hamlets. The Bishop is called the Ordinarie, in the Ecclesiasticall Law. Quia habet ordinariam iurisdictionem in iure proprio, et non per deputationem : for that he hath ordinarie iurisdiction in his owne proper right, and not by deputation, in causes Ecclesiasticall. All the Archbishops and Bishops of England haue beene founded by the Kings of England; and do hold of the King by Baronie, and haue been all called by writ to the Court of Parliament, and are Lords of Parliament. And the Bishopricks in Wales, were founded by the Princes of Wales; and the Principalitie of Wales was holden of the King of England, as of his Crowne. And the Bishops of Wales are also called by Writ to Parlia∣ment, and are Lords of Parliament as Bishops of England be. There were within the Realme of England one hundred and eight ene Monasteries, founded by the Kings of England, whereof such Abbots and Priors as were founded to hold of the King per Baroniam, and were called to the Parliament by Writ, were Lords of Parliament, and had places and voices there. And of them were twenty sixe Abbots, and two Priors, as by the Rolles of Parliament appeare: yet if you reckon the Abbot of Feuer∣sham in Kent, founded by King Stephen, there were twentie and seuen, which some do, saith my learned Author, warranted by these words in the Cartularie: Et dedit Abbati, et Monachis, et successoribus s is Minerium de Feuersham, Com. Kane. simul cum Hundredo, &c. tenend. per Baroni∣am. But (saith he) albeit this Abbot held by a Baronie, yet because he was neuer (that I finde) called by Writ, he neuer sat in Parliament. Bishopricks in England, Cam. l. . with that of the Isle of Man, are 37. whose ex∣tents I set downe in the passage of this worke. Deanries 26. whereof thir∣teene were ordained by Henrie the eighth, in the greater Cathedral Churches after the Monkes were thrust out. Archdeacouries threesco . Dignities and Prebends fiue hundred fourty foure. Numbred also there are Parish churches vnder Bishops 9284 of which 3845. be Appropriat, as I finde in a Catalogue, saith he, exhibited to King Iames. Now, Appropriat Churches, those are called, which by the Popes authoritie comming betweene, with consent of the King, and the Bishop of the Diocesse were vpon certaine conditions tyed, or Instruments vnited, annexed, and incorporate for euer, vnto Monasteries, Bishopricks, Col∣ledges, and Hospitals, endowed with small lands, either for that the said Churches were built their Lordships and Lands or graunted by the Lords of the said Lands. Which Churches afterwards when the Abbeyes and Monasteries were suppressed, became Laye Fees, to the great damage of the Church. Henry the eighth, presently vpon the suppression of Monasteries, and his ordination of certaine Cathedrall and Collegiate Churches, set d wne by the aduice of his Counsell, a number of Rules and Statutes to be obser∣ued by the Officers and Ministers residing in the same. As appeares by this Record following, which I thought to transcribe. Henricus Octauus Dei gracia Anglie, Francie, et Hibernie, Rex, Fidei Defensor, ac in terra supremum Ecclesie Anglicane, et Hibernie caput. Vni∣uersis sancte matris Ecclesie silijs ad quorum noticiam presens Scriptum per∣uenerit Salutem. Cumet nobis et Regni nostri Preceribus, vniuer soque Senatui qu m Par∣liamentum vocamus visum sit Deo, et confidimus nos huc mouente, Mona∣steria, que passim in regno nostro extabant, tum propter graues, et multiplices illorum enormitates, tum ob alias iustas rationabilesque causas supprimere, olere, et in meliores vsus convertere. Nos et diuine voluntati conformius, m ius re Christiana esseducentes, vt vbi ignorantia et superstitio regna∣bant, ibi sincerus Dei cultus vigeat, et sanctum Christi Euangelium assidue et pure annuncietur: Et preteria vt ad Christiane fidei, ac pietatis incrementum iuuentus Regni nostri in bonis literis instituatur, et pauperes perpetuo susten∣tentur; in ipsorum Monasteriorum loco Ecclesias ereximus et cons ituimus: Quarum alias Cathedrales, alias Collegiatas vocari volumus; pro quarum Ecclesiarum ac Collegiorum gubernaecione et regimine leges et statuta que se∣quntur prescribend. curauimus, quibus tam Decani et vtriusque ordinis Ca∣nonici, quam ceteri omnes ministri, pueri et pauperes, qui in ipsis Ecclesijs commoraturi sunt, pareant et ebsequantur, eisque vt à nobis conditis et perfe∣ct is regantur et gubernentur. Id quod si fecerint ingens sine pictatis incre∣mentum in hoc regno nostro peruenturum esse confidemus; Et nos expectatione voto nostro qui ad Dei optumi maximi gloriam ac fidei Christiane aug∣mentum has Ecclesias ereximus, et varijs ministrorum ordinibus enornaui∣mus, ha d quaquam fraudabimus. Dat. &c. The Statutes, rules and orders were annexed hereunto; which were very many, and more then can conueniently be included in this short Treatise, and more I thinke then were well performed. As may partly be proued by an In unction from the Queenes Maiestie to the Archbishop of Canterbu∣ry, Mathew Parker, in these words. By the Queene. The Queenes Maiesty considering how the pallaces and houses of Ca∣thedrall Churches and Colledges of this Realme haue ben both of ancyent and late tyme, buylded and inclosed in seuerall to susteyne and kepe Socye∣ties of learned men professing Study and prayer for the edification of the Church of God; and so consequently to serue the Common-weale. And vnderstanding of late that within the houses hereof, as well the chiefe Go∣uernours as the Prebendaries, Students, and members thereof being marri∣ed, do keepe particular housholds, with their wiues, children, and Nurses, whereof no small offence groweth to thentent of the Founders, and to the quiet and orderly profession of studie and learning within the same, hath thought meete to prouide remedie herein, lest by sufferance thereof, the rest of the Colledges, specially such as be replenished with young Students, as the very roomes and buildings be not answerable for such families of women and young children, should follow the like example. And therefore expresly willeth and commandeth, that no manner of person, being either the head or member of any Colledge or Cathedrall Church within this , shall from the time of the notification hereof, in the same Col∣ledge haue, or be permitted to haue, within the precinct of any such Col∣ledge, his wife or other woman to abide and dwell in the same: or to fre∣quent & haunt any lodging within the said Colledge, vpon paint that who∣soeuer shall do to the contrary, shall forfeite all Ecclesiasticall promotions in any Cathedrall or Collegiate Church within this Realme. And for con∣tinuance of this order, her Maiestie willeth that the Transcript hereof shall be written in the booke of the Statutes of euery such Colledge; and shall be reputed as parcell of the Statutes of the same. Yeuen vnder our Signet at ur Towne of ipswiche, the ninth of August in the third yeare of our reigne. Now Reader if thou wouldest know more particularly the Ecclesiasti∣call State of England, will it please thee reade the declaration following. A briefe declaration of the nomber of all promocions Ecclesiasti∣call, of what nam or title soeuer, at the Taxacion of the first fruites and tenthes, with the yearlie value of eiche Bishop∣ricke, Deanrie, and Archdeaconrie, and the tenth of the Clar¦gie in euery Diocesse.

C Hristian Religion (of which I haue spoken before) which presently after our blessed Sauiours passion, was both preached, and planted in this Island, by Ioseph of Arimathea, and his associates, and after that aduanced, and increased by Lucius King of the Britaines, and his famous Clerkes; being darkened, ouerclouded, and al∣most totally eclipsed, with the contagious smoke arising from such abhominable sacrifices as were offered here vnto strange Idols; was againe illumined, and recomforted with the glorious beames of reli∣gious light by Augustine the Monke, and his fellow-labourers in Christs vineyard. Which Augustine (sent hither from Rome by Gregory the great) when he had found such fauour in the sight of King Ethelbert, that he might freely preach the Gospell in this his countrey; hee chose for as∣semblie and prayer, an old Church in the East part of this Citie, which was a long time before builded by the Romanes, and hee made thereof (by li∣cence of the King) a Church, for himselfe and his successours, dedicating the same to the name of our blessed Sauiour Christ; whereof it was alwayes afterward called Christ-Church. And by the meanes of the said Pope Gre∣gory, hee translated the Metropolitan See from London (the Cathedrall Church being then at Saint Peters in Cornhill) to this his newly consecra∣ted Church here in Canterbury: whereof he was the first Archbishop. By these proceedings the prophesie of Merlin was fulfilled, which foretold that Christianity should faile, and then reuiue againe, when the See of Lon∣don did adorne Canterbury. Of which out of an old Robert of Glocester. Manuscript these fol∣lowing Rimes. Erchebysshop furste of alle Seynt Austyn was ther; But ye Erchcbysshops Se at London was er: Tho camme Merlynes word to sothe atten ende, Yat ye dignyte of London to Canterbery sholde wende. Anothur chyrche in Cantyrbery he lete rere, Yat is clupyd Christ Chyrche, and now the Se is there. Since which time, this sacred structure, by the pious and exceeding charges of succeeding Archbishops (by the deuotion of those dayes made willing to disburse great summes) is so raised aloft (saith learned Camden ) to that maiestie and statelinesse, Camd. in Kent. that it striketh a sensible impression of Re∣ligion in the hearts and mindes of the beholders; of which, as also of the Citie, will it please you reade this Ogdoasticon out of a Manuscript penned by Iohn Iohnston of Aberden, sometimes the Kings professour of Diuinitie in the Vniuersitie of S. Andrewes in Scotland. M ss. in ib. Quae minima in paruo regno pars ante fuisti, Facta es Cantiadum regia prima Ducum. Quae modica in magno imperio pars ante fuisti, Maiorem fecit Pontificalis honor. Alterius cum iura locitecum inde tulisti, Facta es finitimis imperiosa locis. Sponsa tibi Christi si tot cumulauit honores Non iterum huic par sit reddere velle suos? To this his Church Austine adioyned a Monastery, The founda∣tion of the Pri∣ory of S. Tri∣nitie. and dedicated the same to the blessed Trinitie; into which Laurence, his next Successour, brought Benedictine Monkes; the head whereof was called a Prior. Which word (saith Lambard in his perambulation of Kent) howsoeuer it soundeth, was indeed but the name of a second Officer, because the Bishop himselfe was accounted the very Abbot; for in old time, the Bishops were, for the most part, chosen out of such Monasteries, and therefore most commonly had their palaces neare adioyning, and gouerned there as Abbots. By meanes whereof it came to passe, that such Abbeyes were greatly enriched, and en∣dowed with wealth and possessions; insomuch that this Priory at the disso∣lution (being valued at Robin Hoods peniworths) was found to be yearly worth (besides iurisdiction ouer diue s hundreds) (as you may finde in the Exchequer booke, called, Nomina Villarum ) two thousand foure hundred eightie nine pounds foure shillings nine pence. But Henry the eighth (saith Camden ) scattered this wealth heaped vp together in so many ages, and dispersed these Monks: in lieu of whom he placed in this Church a Deane, an Archdeacon, Prebendaries twelue, and sixe Preachers; who in places adioyning round about, should teach and preach the word of God. The Archbishoprick, at this day (whose Prouince containeth twentie two Bishoprickes, Godwin. de pra∣sid Angl and Diocesse the greatest part of Kent) being but valued in the Kings bookes at two thousand eight hundred sixteene pounds, seuen∣teene shillings, nine pence. Howsoeuer in former times the Archbishop was wont to pay to the Pope at euery income for his first-fruits ten thou∣sand Ducats or Florens; and for his Pall fiue thousand, euery Ducate being of our Sterling money foure shillings sixe pence. And (as I finde it in an old Manuscript) for Rom-scot or Peter-pence, Lib. in lib . seuen pounds seuenteene shil∣lings. Seuentie three Archbishops in a continued traine of Succession, haue sitten in this glorious chaire; which at this present doth adde grace and ho∣nour to George Abbot, Doctor of Diuinity, sometime Deane of Winche∣ster, Master of the Vniuersitie Colledge in Oxford, Bishop of Couentry and Lichfield, from whence hee was remoued to London, and from thence translated to this Metropoliticall seate of Canterbury. Who hath bestowed great summes of money in building and endowing of an Hospitall at Guild∣ford in Surrey, the Towne wherein he was borne. But now to come within the Cathedrall Church; which hath beene, and still is, Archbishop honoured with the funerall Monuments of many renowned Princes; of which although it may iustly vaunt, yet was it for nothing else so famous, as for the life, death, sepulcure, and Shrine of Thomas Beck t Archbishop of this See; by which her estimation was aduanced beyond all reason, measure and wonder. This Thomas Becket was borne in London, his fathers name was Gil∣bert, a Merchant, his mothers M tilda, a stranger borne in Syria. He was first taught and brought vp, by the Prior of Mercon Abbey in Surrey, and from thence sent to the Vniuersities of Oxford, Paris, and Bononia, to study the Canon Law; vpon his returne, he proceeded Doctor of that faculty in Oxford; after which (as you may haue it in the History of his life, written by the right reuerend Father in God, Francis Godwin, now Bishop of He∣reford) in short time he was preferred by Theobald, Archbishop of this See, vnto the Archdeaconry of Canterbury, the Prouostship of Beuerley, and the Parsonages of Bromfeeld, and Saint Mary Hill: a Prebend in Paules, and another in the Church of Lincolne, and withall commended by him so ef∣fectually to King Henry the second, that he receiued him into the number of his Chaplaines, aduanced him to the honour of Lord Chancellour of England, and (after the death of the said Theobald ) to this Grace, and Pri∣ma ie of Canterbury: presently after his consecration, being yet scarcely warme in his seate, vnder colour of defending the rights of his Church, hee stubbornly opposed himselfe against his Lord and Soueraigne in all his roy∣all proceedings, insomuch that he was constrained to exile him the king∣dome. Of which you shall heare a peece out of Harding in the life of Henry the second. He exiled then, Hard. cap. 31. Thomas of Cauntorbury Out of Englande, and many of his alliaunce, For cause of his rebellious gouernaunce; And as he came fro Rome by Fraunce awaye With language fel, he prayede the Kyng that daye The poyntes to mende. And now, if you will giue me leaue a little to digresse; I will tell you a tale (beleeue it as you lift) reported by the said Thomas Becket himselfe, how that being in banishment, our blessed Lady gaue him a golden Eagle, full of precious ointment, inclosed in a stone vessell, commanding him to preserue it; foretelling withall, that the kings of England, which should be therewith anointed, should be strong champions, and stout defendours of the Church that they should be bountifull, benigne, and fortunate, and that they should peaceably recouer such lands or territories, as had beene before lost by their predecessours; so long as they had this Eagle, with the viall or sacred vessell in their custody, telling him withall, that hee should bee a Martyr. This vision happened to him (forsooth) at Sens in France, in the Nunnes Church consecrated to Saint Columbe, in which Citie hee found Pope Alexander the third, a man, like himselfe, of an ambitious and tur∣bulent ierie spirit, into whose bosome, saith Hollinshead, he emptied whole cart-loads of complaints and grieuances, like a contumacious rebell, against his soueraigne Lord: excommunicating and cursing with bell, booke, and candle, all that did any way adhere vnto the kings partie. But now to returne to the words, by which hee did expresse his strange and incredible apparition, which I will set downe in the same language, as I found them anciently written in the Lieger booke of the Abbey of Whalley in Lanchishire. Thus he begins. Quando ego Thomas Cantuar. Archiepiscopus, exul ab Anglia, fugie bam ad Franciam, veni ad Papam Alex. qui tunc Senonis erat, vt ei osten∣derem malas consuetudines, & abusiones quas Rex Anglie in Ecclesiam in troducebat. A wholly end ing own purpose. Quadam nocte cum essem in Ecclesia Sancte Columbe in Monial. roga∣ui Reginam Virginum vt daret Regi Anglie et hered. propositum et volunta∣tem emendandi se erga Ecclesiam, et quod Christus pro sua miserecordia, ampliori dilectione ipsum faceret diligere Ecclesiam. Statim apparuit mihi beata Virgo, habens in pectore istam aquilam auream, siue lapideam, & ac∣cipiens Aquilam de pectore suo ampullam includit. Aquilam cum Ampulla in manu mea posuit, et hec verba per ordinem dixit. Ista est vnctio per quam Reges Anglie debent inungi; non isti qui modo sunt & regnant, & regnabunt, quia maligni sunt, & propter peccata sua multa amiserunt, & amitterent. Sunt autem Reges Anglie futuri qui inun∣gerentur vnctione benigni, & pugiles Ecclesie erunt. Nam isti terram amis∣sam à parentibus pacisice recuperabunt, donec Aquilam cum Ampulla habe∣ant. Est autem Rex Anglorum futurus qui primo mungeretur vnctione ista, qui terram amissam à parentibus scilicet Normanniam, Aquitaniam, recu∣perabit sine vi; Rex iste erit maximus inter Reges, & est ille qui edificabit multas Ecclesias in terra sancta, & fugabit omnes Paganos de Babilon, & in adem Ecclesias edi icabit plures, quotiescunque Rex portabit Aquilam in pe∣ctore, victoriam habebit de inimicis suis, & regnum eius semper augmenta∣bitu , tu autem es Martyr futurus. Tunc rogaui beatam Virginem, vt ostenderet mihi vbi custodirem tam preciosum Sanctuarium, que dixit mihi, est vir in ciuitate isla Willielmus Monachus Sancti Cipriani Pictauie eiectus iniuste ab Abbate suo de Ab∣bachia sua, qui rogat Papam vt Abbatem suum compellat, vt eum in Abba∣chiam suam reducat: trade sibi Aquilam cum Ampulla, vt eam ad Ciuitatem Pictauie portet, et in Ecclesia Sancti Gregorij, que est iuxta Ecclesiam Sancti Hillarij eam abscondat in capite Ecclesie versus occidentem sub lapide mag∣no, ibi inuenietur in tempore oportuno et erit vnctio Regum Anglorum. Henry the first Duke of Lancaster, vnder Edward the third in the warres of France, had it deliuered to him by an holy man (say they) which found it by reuelation. But of this enough, if not too much. This Archbishop Becket, being recalled from exile, and restored to his former honours and reuenewes, carried himselfe more obstinately then be∣fore, perturbing the whole State with curses and excommunications in maintaining of Ecclesiasticall liberties (as he pretended) but most of all this kinde of dealing grieued the King, who cursed the time that euer he made him Archbishop. Which is thus explained in old rimes. For which the King was with him sore displeased; That then he sayd, Iohn had I had men that ment Myne honeste, I were not thus diseased With such a Clerk, thus greeued and vneased. It happened (amongst other) foure Knights to be present at this speech of the King, namely, Reynald Fitz vrse, Hugh Moruill, William Tracy, and Richard Briton ; who gathered thereby, that they should do a deed ve∣ry acceptable vnto him, Math. West. if they killed the Archbishop. Whereupon (with∣out either warrant or priuitie of their Soueraigne) they posted into Eng∣land; came with their swords drawne into this his owne Church, and therein most barbarously murdered him with many blowes, vpon Tuesday the 28. of December, Ann. Dom. 1170. as saith Mat. Paris, who in the same place obserues that many remarkable occurrences behappened this Martyr euer vpon the Tuesday, more then vpon any other day in the weeke. Mars secundum poetas (saith he) Deus belli nuncupatur: vita Sancti Thome (secundum illud Iob, vita hominis militia est super terram) tota suit contra hostem bellicosa: passus fuit die Martis et translatus die Martis. Die Martis sederunt Principes aduersus eum apud Northampton. Die Martis actus est in exilium. Die Martis apparuit ei Dominus apud Pontiniacum, dicens, Thoma, Thoma, Ecclesia mea glorificabitur in sanguine tuo. Et die Martis reuersus est ab exilio. Martyrij palmam die Martis est adeptus. Et Die Martis Anno 1220. venerabile eius corpus gloriam translationis susce∣pit, anno 50. post passionem eius. In English as followeth. Mars according to the Poets, is called the God of warre; the life of Saint Thomas (according to that of Iob, the life of man is a warfare vpon earth) was a continuall conflict against the enemy; vpon the Tuesday he suffered, vpon Tuesday he was translated, vpon Tuesday the Peeres of the Land sat in councell against him at Northampton. Vpon Tuesday he was banished; vpon Tuesday the Lord appeared to him at Pontiniacke, saying, Thomas, Thomas, my Church shall be glorified in thy bloud. Vpon Tuesday he returned from exile, vpon Tuesday he got the palme or reward of Martyr∣dome, and vpon Tuesday the yeare 1220. his venerable body receiued the glory and renowne of translation, in the fiftieth yeare after his passion. But to returne. Rog. Houeden. Annal. in . Hen. 2. It is said that these foure knights despairing to obtaine the Kings pardon, wandred vp and downe (for a time) like vagabonds and runagates vpon the earth; being hstefull to all their kindred, as well as to their countreymen, vntill at length they resolued to go a pilgrimage to Rome, where Pope Alexander the third enioyned them this penance, which was to trauell to Ierusalem, and there to liue as penitenciall conuertites in the blacke mountaine; where they finished their dayes; and were buried in Jerusalem before the doore of the Temple, for whom this inscription was framed. Hic iacent miseri qui martirizauerunt beatum Thomam Archiepisco∣pum Cantuariensem. Id m. Of these foure Knights which murdered this Archbishop, and of the three Bishops which conspired together against him, I found these Hexa∣ i ers in an old Manuscript in Sir Robert Cottons Library.

The body of this murdered Bishop was buried first in the vndercrost of the Church, but shortly after it was taken vp and laid in a most sumptuous Shrine in the East end; at the charges of Stephen Langton his successour: being matriculated by the Pope a glorious Saint and Martyr. To this new shrined Martyr, people of all degrees, and from all parts, flocked in pilgri∣mage: as Chaucer thus hath it in his Prologue to his Canterbury tales. —fro euery shires end Of Englond, to Canterbury they wend: The holy blisfull Martir for to seeke, That hem hath holpen wher they were seke. Eras. alogue. They loaded the Shrine with such large offerings, that the Church did all round about abound with more then Princely riches, whose meanest part was pure gold, garnished with many precious stones. Whereof the cheesest was a Regall of France, or a rich gemme, offered by King Lewis, who asked, . La d. . and obtained (you may be sure, he buying it so deare) that no passenger betwixt Douer and Whitesand, should perish by shipwracke. Such pressing there was to touch him, and such creeping and kneeling to his Tombe, that the prints of their deuotion in the marble stones remaine to this day. Euery pillar resounding the miracles of this reputed Martyr, and the Church it selfe, dedicated to Christ, forced to giue place to the name of Saint Thomas. Er sin. in O al. de pereg . religi∣ons ergo. His bloud was as then almost matched in vertue with our blessed Sauiours, and his old shoe deuoutly kissed by all passengers. The building of this shrine is thus briefly described by that painfull Antiquarie Io. Stow. Stow Annal in H. 8. It was built (saith he) about a mans height all of stone, then vp∣ward of Timber plaine, within the which was a chest of iron, containing the bones of Thomas Becket, Skull, and all, with the wound of his death, and the peece cut out of his skull laid in the same wound. The timber worke of this Shrine on the out side was couered with plates of gold, da∣masked and embossed with wires of gold, garnished with broches, images, Angels, chaines, precious stones, and great orient pearles, the spoile of which Shrine (in gold and iewels of an inestimable value) silled two great chests, one of which, sixe or eight strong men could do no more then con∣uey out of the Church: all which was taken to the Kings vse, and the bones of Saint Thomas (by commandement of the Lord Cromwell ) were then and there burnt all to ashes. Which was in September, the yeare 1538. Hen. 8.30. Diuers Epitaphs were composed to the memory of this much honoured Martyr, expressing the cause, time, and place of his martyrdome. For ex∣ample. Annus Millenus, Houeden in H. 2. centenus, septuagenus Primus erat, Primas quo ruit ense Thomas. Pro Christi sponsa, Christi sub tempore, Christi In Templo, Christi verus amat r obit. Quis moritur?

Tu per Thome sanguinem quem pro te impendit, Fac nos Christe scandere quo Thomas as endit. For the bloud of Thomas which he for thee did spend Grant vs Christ to clime where Thomas did ascend. The Pope writ to the Clergie of England, to make a new Holiday for this late Martyr, an extract or clause whereof followe h. Wee admonish you all, and by the authoritie which wee retevne, doe straightly charge you, that you celebrate the day of the suffering of the blessed man Thomas, the glorious Martyr, sometime Archbishop of Can∣terbury, euery yeare in most solemne sort, and that with deuout prayers ye endeuour your selues to purchase forgiuenesse of sinnes: that he which for Christs sake suffered banishment in this life, and martyrdome in death by constancie of vertue, through continuall supplication of faithfull people, may make intercession for you to God. The tenor of these letters were scarcely read, but euery man with a loud voice began to recite and sing, Te Deum laudamus. Furthermore, because his Suffragans had not exhibited due reuerence to him their father, either in time of his banishment, or at his returne from the same, but rather persecuted him; that they might openly confesse their errour and wickednesse to all men, they made this Collect. Be fauourable good Lord to our supplication and prayer, A Collect de∣uised in ho∣nour of Arch∣bishop Becket. that we which acknowledge our selues guilty of iniquitie, may be deliuered by the inter∣cession of Thomas thy blessed Martyr and Bishop. Amen. This Collect was likewise vsed by the Couent of S. Albons, and other Religious Votaries vpon the day of his martyrdome. Robert the first Earle of Dreux, and the fourth sonne of Lewis the grosse, King of France, laid the foundation of a Collegiate Church, to the honour of this supposed holy Martyr, called, S. Thomas du Louure in Paris, the re∣uenues whereof were augmented by his wife Agnes, Countesse of Bray, and confirmed by the Bull of Clement the third, Bishop of Rome, in these termes.

Ann. 1428. augmented by Iohn Duke of Britaine, Montefort, and Richmund, as appeares by his Charter which I haue read. Many other religious structures, Churches, Chappels, and Oratories in forraine parts were erected, and endowed to the memory of this our English Martyr. Neare to the Gallerie of the Louure, and adioyning to the Collegiate Church, is a prettie faire street, which at this day is called, La rue de S. Thomas du Louure, the streete of S. Thomas at the Louure. Knights of the order of S. Thomas ▪ Richard the first, King of England, after the surprisall of Acrres, institu∣ted an order of Knights, which he called, The Order of Saint Thomas ; they held the rule of Saint Augustine, and tooke for their Patron the foresaid Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, as you may reade in the Thea∣ter of Honour, lib. 9. cap. 11. But I stand too long gazing and glossing vpon this imaginarie monu∣ment, digressing from the breuitie of that method which I haue proposed to my selfe. Let me view the sumptuous monument still remaining of Ed∣ward surnamed the blacke Prince (so by-named not of his colour, but of his dreaded acts in battell) vpon which this Epitaph is inlayd with brasse. Cy gist le noble Prince Mouss Edward, aisnez filz du tresnoble Roy Ed∣ward tiers: iadis Prince d'aquitaine et de Gales, Due de Cornwaille, et counte de Ces e, qi morust, e la feste de la Trinite qestoit le vni iour de iuyn l'an de grace mil troiscens septante sisine.

Here lieth the noble Prince, Monsieur Edward, the eldest sonne of the thrice noble King Edward the third, in former time Prince of Aquitaine, and of Wales, Duke of Cornwall, and Earle of Che∣ster, who died on the feast of Trinitie, which was the eight day of Iune, in the yeare of Grace, 1376. To the soule of whom, God grant mercy. Amen. Who so thou be that passeth by; Where these corps entombed lie: Vnderstand what I shall say, As at this time speake I may. Such as thou art, sometime was I, Such as I am, such shalt thou be. I little thought on th'oure of death, So long as I enioyed breath. Great riches here I did possesse, Whereof I made great noblenesse. I had gold, siluer, wardrobes, and Great treasure, horses, houses, land: But now a caitife poore am I, Deepe in the ground, lo here I lie. My beautie great is all quite gone, My flesh is wasted to the bone. My house is narrow now and throng, Nothing but Truth comes from my tongue: And if ye should see me this day, I do not thinke but ye would say, That I had neuer beene a man; So much altered now I am. For Gods sake pray toth'heauenly King, That he my soule to heauen would bring. All they that pray and make accord, For me vnto my God and Lord; God place them in his Paradise, Wherein no wretched caitife lies. The death of this Prince (which fortuned in the fourtie and sixth yeare of his age) was a heauy losse to the state; S. Daniel.

Edwardus filius Edw. 3. primogenitus, Princeps Wallie fortunatissimus, & miles in bello audacissimus, inter validissima bella gesta militaria, magni∣sice ab eodem peracta; Iohannem Regem Francie apud Poyteires debellauit, & pluribus, tam nobilibus quam alijs, de dicto regno captis, & interfectis, eundem Regem captiuauit, & ipsum potenter in Augliam ductum Patri suo presentauit. Henricum etiam intrusorem Hispanie, potentissime in bello deui∣cit, & Petrum Hispanie Regem dudum à regno suo expulsum potenti virtute in regnum suum restituit. Vnde propter ingentem sibi probitatem, & actus ipsius triumphales memoratum Principem inter regales Regum memorias dignum duximus commendandum. Hen y the fourth King of England. Here lieth the body of Henry the fourth, King of England, whose Tombe is richly adorned and garnished about with the Armes of all the Christian Princes, and most of the greatest Peeres of this kingdome, then liuing; vp∣on which I finde no Inscription, who died 20. Mar. Anno Dom. 1412. aetat. 46. Reg. 14. This King finished his politique and victorious raigne in peace and ho∣nour. Howsoeuer the iniustice of his first entrance (stepping into the seat Royall by the deposition and murder of his lawfull Soueraigne King Ri∣chard the second) left a dishonourable staine vpon all his actions. He ad∣uised his Sonne Henry (after him King) vpon his death bed, to punish the oppressours of his people: Speed in vita Hen. . for so shalt thou (quoth hee) obtaine fauour of God, and loue and feare of thy subiects, who whiles they haue wealth, so long shalt thou haue their obedience, but made poore by oppressions, will be ready for insurrections. Let this memoriall of him, in such rimes as I haue it, stand for his Epi∣taph.

Gower in the last part of his Tripartite Chronicle giues vs this vari∣ous Character following of this Henry, and his predecessour Richard the second, Kings.

Vide is in Chan¦cerum. fol. 316. vlt. edit. The same Authour in another place, to the laud and memory of this King, hath these nicking Hexameters. Electus Christi pie Rex Henrice fuisti, Qui bene venisti, cum propria regna petisti, Tu mala vicisti que bonis bona restituisti, Et populo tristi noua gaudia contribuisti, Est mihi spes lata, quod adhuc pro te renouata Succedent fata veteri probitate beata. Et tibi nam grata gratia sponte data. And the said Gower makes a ballade to this king, to his no little com∣mendations. Whereof take the first Stanza for an Essay. O noble worthy Kyng Henry the fearth, In whom the gladde Fortune is befall: The people to gouerne here vpon earth, God hath thee chosen in comfort of vs all. The worship of this land, which was dounfall, Now stant vpright through grace of thy goodnesse. Which euery man is hold for to blesse. Caxton the continuer of Polychronicon, saith, that this King Henry the fourth found great riches, whereof Richard his predecessour was possest at the time of his resignation of the Scepter royall. These are the wordes: Thenne he fonde in Kyng Rychads tresorye nyne hundryd thowsand no∣bles besydes Iewels and Vessels, Poly. . cap. 0. whyche was as moche worthe or more. And there was found in the Tresorers kepyng of Englonde an hundryd and fyfty thowsand nobles; and Iewels and Vessels as moche worthe or more: Vpon which, saith Fabian, It shulde seme that Kyng Rycharde was ryche, Fab in Ann. 1400. whan hys money and Iewelles amounted to seuen hundryd thow∣sand pounds. Sir Simon D'ewes Knight, a diligent searcher of Antiquities, gaue me the copie of King Henries Will, here entombed, examined by the origi∣nall vnder the priuie Seale, according to the orthographie in the said ori∣ginall: which is not vnworthy, I hope, of my Readers perusall. The last Will of King Henry the fourth. In the name of God Fadir, and Son, and holy Gost, thre persons and on God. I Henry, sinful wretch, be the grase of God Kyng of Englond, and of Fraunce, and Lord of Irlond, being in myne hole mynd mak my Testa∣ment in manere and forme that suyth. First I bequeth to Almyghty God my sinful Soul; the whiche had neuer be worthy to be man but through hys mercy and hys grase; whiche lyffe I haue mispendyd, whereof I put me whollily in his grase and his mercy, with all myn herte. And what tym hit liketh him of hys mercy for to tak me to hym, the body for to be beryed in the Chirch of Caunterbury, aftyr the descrecion of my Cousin the Erch∣byshcoppe of Caunterbury. And also I thank all my Lordis and trewe peple for the trewe servise that they haue don to me. and Yask hem for∣giuenes if haue missentreted hem in any wyse. And als far as they haue of∣fendyd me in wordis or in de is in any wyse, I prey God forgeue hem hit and Y do, Also Y devyse and ordeyn that ther be a chauntre perpetuall of twey Precitis for to sing and prey for my soul in the aforseyd chirch of Caunterbury, in soche plase and aftyr soch ordinaunse as hit semeth best to my aforse d cousin of Canterbury. Also Y ordeyne and deuise that of my goodors restitution be made to all hem that Y haue wrongfully greuyd, or any good had of theirs without iust tytle. Also I will and ordeyne that of my goodis all my debtis be al paied in all hast possible, and that my seruants be rewardyd aftyr ther nede, and desert of seruise: and in especyal, lkin, Iohn Warren, and William Thorpe, Gromes of my chambre. Also Y will that all those that be bond in eny debt that Y owe in eny wyse, or haue vn∣dyrtake to eny man for eny debt that Y owe, or that they can dwlye shewe hit, that all soche persons be kept harmlysse. Also I will that a sees and wa∣ges that ar not paied to be paied, and in especiall to my seruaunts of my houshold, befor eny oder. And also that all myn Annuityes, fees, and do∣nacions grauntyd by me byfor this tym be my lettres patents, be kept and paied aftyr the effect of the forseyd lettres patents; and yn especiall to all hem that haue bene trewe seruaunts to me and toward me alway. Also Y will and prey my Son that he haue recomendyd Thomas de l crois, that hath well and trwly seruyd me, and also in the same wyse, Iacob Raysh and Halley. Also I will that the Quene be endowyd of the Duche of Lancastre. Also I will that all my Officers both of houshold and other, the which ne∣deth to haue pardon of eny thing that touch here offices both of losse and oder thing, they haue pardon therof in semblable mancre, as y of my grase haue bewont to do befor this tym. And for to execut this Testament well and trulich for grete tryst that I haue on my Son the Prince, Y ordeyne and mak him my Executor of my Testament foreseyd, kalling to him soche as him thinkyth in his discrecion that can and will labor to the sonrest spede of my will comprehended in this myn Testament. And to fulfill trwly all things foresaid y charge my foreseyd Son vpon my blessyng. Wetnessyng my welbelouyd Cousins, Thomas Erchbyshop of Caunterbury foreseyde and Edward Duke of Yorke, Thomas Bishchop of Duresme, Richard the Lord Grey my Chamberlaine, Iohn Tiptost myn Treasuror of Englond, Iohn Prophete Wardeine of my priuie seale; Thomas Erpingham, Iohn Nor∣bery, Robert Waterton, and meny oder being present. In witnessyng wherof my priuy Seele be my commaundement is set to this my Testament. I yeue at my manere of Grenwich the xxi. dey of the moneth of Ianuer, the yere of owr Lord, M.CCCC.VIII. and of our Reigne the tenth. He departed this world the twentieth of March, as aforesaid, some three yeares and odde moneths after the making of this his last Will and Testa∣ment, in a Chamber belonging to the Abbot of Westminster, called Ieru∣salem, hauing beene prophetically foretold that hee should die in Ieru∣salem. The words, saith Harding, that the King said at his death, were of high complaint, but nought of repentance, of vsurpement of the Realme, ne of restorement of right heires to the Crowne. Which he thus versifies. O Lorde, he sayd, O God omnipotent, Now se I well thy Godhede loueth me, That suffered neuer my foes to haue their entent Of myne person in myne aduersitie: Ne in myne sicknesse, ne in myne infyrmyte: But ay hast kept it fro theyr maleuolence, And chastised me by thy beneuolence. Lorde I thanke the with all my herte, With all my soule, and my spirites clere; This wormes mete, this caryon full vnquerte, That some tyme thought in world it had no pere, This face so foule that leprous doth appere, That here afo e I haue had such a pryde To purtray oft in many place full wide. Of which right now the porest of this lande, Except on y of their benignite Wolde lothe to oke vpon I vnderstande Of which, good Lorde, that thou so visyte me A thousande tymes the Lord in Trinyte With all my herte, I thanke the and commende Into thyne handes my soule withouten ende. And dyed so in fayth and hole creance At Cauntorbury buryed with great reuerence, As a kyng shulde be with all kynde of circumstance, Besyde the Prynce Edward, with grete expence. His funerall Exequies were solemnised here in all pompe and state, his Sonne Henry the fifth and his Nobilitie being present, vpon Trinitie Son∣day next following the day of his death. The reason (as I take it) wherefore King Henry made choice of this Church for his buriall place, Mary the first wife of Henry the fourth. was, for that his first wife (the Lady Mary, one of the daughters and coheires of Vmphrey de Bohun, Earle of Hereford, Essex, and Northampton) was here entombed; who died before hee came to the Crowne, Ann. Dom. 1394. leauing behinde her a glorious and faire renowned issue of children, to the comfort of her husband, and good of the common-wealth: viz. Henry afterwards King of England, Thomas Duke of Clarence, Iohn Duke of Bedford, Humphrey Duke of Glocester. Blanch married to William Duke of Bauaria, and Emperour, and Philip mar∣ried to Iohn King of Denmarke and Norway. Here in the same Sepulchre lies the body of Ioane his second wife, daugh∣ter of Charles the fifth, Stow Annal. King of Nauarre, who died without issue at Haue∣ring in the bower, Queene Ioane second wife of Henry the fourth. in the County of Essex, the tenth of Iuly, Anno Dom. 1437. Reg. H. 6.15. hauing continued widow 24. yeares; This Queene endured some troubles in the raigne of her Stepsonne King Henry the fift, being charged that shee should by witchcraft or sorcerie seeke the Kings death, Speed. Hist. in vit. Hen. 5. a capitall offence indeed, if the accusation was true, vpon which fur∣mise her goods and lands were forfeited by Act of Parliament; and shee committed to safe keeping, in the Castle of Leedes in Kent: and from thence to Pemsey, attended onely with nine of her seruants; but (belike) her innocency within a little time deliuered her from imprisonment, and she liued a long time after in all princely prosperitie. Here, Margaret Duchesse of Clarence. Vincent. Catal. Hon. Mills. Catal. betweene her two husbands ( Iohn Beaufort, Marquesse Dorset, and Thomas Plantaginet, Duke of Clarence) Margaret, daughter of Tho∣mas, and sister, and one of the heires to Edmond Holland, Earles of Kent, lieth gloriously entombed by her first husband; she had issue Henry Earle of Somerset, Thomas Earle of Perth, Iohn, and Edmund, both Dukes of So∣merset, Ioane Queene of Scots, and Margaret Countesse of Deuonshire: she died full of yeares the last of December, Ann. Dom. 1440. Iohn her first husband lieth on her left side, Iohn Earle of Sou rset, and Marques Dor∣set. as appeares by his armes, and portraiture (for I finde no inscription at all vpon the Monument) who was the eldest sonne of Iohn of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, by his last wife Ka∣therine Swinford, and surnamed Beaufort, of Beaufort, a Castle in Aniou, where he was borne: He was created first Earle of Somerset, and after Mar∣quesse Dorset, by Richard the second: being but of small meanes to support such a swelling title. He made therle of Somerset Marques Io. Harding. cap 192. Of Dorset then; Sir Iohn Beaufort that hight; Of poore liuelode that was that tyme doubtles. But hee was depriued of this title of Marquesse Dorset, by Act of Parlia∣ment, in the first of Henry the fourth, his halfe brother, for whom after∣wards the Commons became earnest petitioners in Parliament for his resti∣tution. But he himselfe was altogether vnwilling to be restored to this kinde of newly inuented honour, being but begun in the ninth yeare of this Kings raigne, and giuen to Robert de Vere, his mignion; the first stiled Mar∣quesse of England, as it is obserued by that most learned Antiquarie and Lawyer, Ti les of ho∣nour pag. 211 Io. Selden Esquire. I finde little of him remarkable, being (belike) sore weakened both in power and spirit, by the foresaid Parliament; where∣by (with others of the Nobilitie) he was reduced to the same estate of ho∣nour and fortune (which was but weake) in which he stood when first Tho∣mas of Woodstocke, Hollins. pa. 513. Duke of Glocester, was arrested; and besides it was not lawfull for him, nor any of the rest, to giue liueries to retainers, or keepe any about him but necessarie seruants. Hee died on Palmesonday the 16. of March, Ann. Dom. 1409. On her right side is the pourtraiture of her second husband, Thomas Duke of Clarence. Thomas Duke of Clarence, second soune of King Henry the fourth, Lord high Ste∣ward of England, Constable of the Kings Host, and Lieutenant Generall of his Armie in France: who (after his many fortunate euents in warre) was the first man that was slaine in the battell of O , little Baugie Baugy, vpon Easter Eue An. Do. 1420. by one Iohn Swinton, a Scot, who wounded him in the face with his Launce, as he was remounting (hauing giuen singular demonstration of his great valour) and so threw him to the ground. And with him that day were slaine many of exemplarie note, besides 4500. common Soul∣diers. This Duke had borne forth his youth with better respect then Prince Henry his brother had done; Hab. . and was made President of the Councell, when his brother was dismissed that office for striking the Lord chiefe Iu∣stice; yet for all that, his father sore feared, that his hastie distempered hu∣mour would breed great troubles in the State: and questionlesse he was of a violent selfe-willie disposition, neglecting now at the last cast the graue ad∣uise of his owne countrey-men, his chiefest Commanders by which, by all likelihood, he might haue escaped all danger: and adhering to the treche∣rous perswasion of a For um bard. Vincent Catal. Stranger, by which hee was betrayed to present de∣struction. Which fierie-rash temper of his, together with the losse of the Battell, and the place of his buriall, is briefly thus set downe by my Author Iohn Harding. And nere at Bawge came Gilbert Vmsreuile, Marshall of France, with V. horse and no mo, And of good wyt, counsayled hym that whyle To keepe the Church, and Goddes seruice tho, And after the Feast to seke vpon his foo. And he aunswered him, yf thou be aferd, Go home thy way, and kepe the church yerd. Wyth that he sayd my Lorde ye haue no men, Wyth the enemyes thus hastely to syght: Your menne wot not of this, ne how, ne whenne, To semble to you of power, ne of myght. For trewly nowe, my Cosin Gray nowe ryght And I, haue here but ten men and no mo, But yet ye shall neuer say we leaue you so. So rode they furth ay chyding by the way, Tyll they to Bawgy ouer the Bridg were gone, When the enemyes were battayled in aray, Where then they light and fought wyth them anone. The Duke was slayne that day there wyth hys sone. Wyth hym were slayne then therle Vmfreuile, And Sir Iohn Gray the Erle of Tankeruile. The Lord Roos, and syr Iohn Lumley, Wyth many other were with hym slayne that daye, Whose names I cannot wryte nor saye The Earles two of Huntingdon no naye, Of Somerset also, were taken there I saye For prisoners and put to great raunson, And laye full long in France then in prison. Thenglish Power came, when all was done, And rescowed then, the deed men where they laye, And brought the Lordes home fro thens full sone That there lay slayne vpon the feeld that daye And buryed them in Englond in good araye Eche one in hys Abbaye or Colage Afore founded within his heritage. The English power vnder the conduct of Thomas Montacute, Earle of Salisbury, comming somewhat too late to this ouer-hastie encounter, thought to haue requited this losse vpon their enemies heads, but at the sight of their forces the French gaue ground, whereby the dead bodie of Clarence was recouered, and (with the rest) conueied into England; and bu∣ried in this Church. Att Canterbury the Duke was of Orleance, Idem eodem: Besyde hys Father King Henry buryed, With suche honoure costage and expence As the Duches his wife coulde have signifyed Which neded not to haue bene modifyed. She was so well within her selfe avysed Of greate sadnesse, and woman hede premised. This following I haue read for his Epitaph. Lib. Sawler, Mss. in bib. Cot. Hic iacet in tumulo Tho. Dux Clar. nunc quasi nullus Qui fuit in bello clarus nec clarior vllus. In the vndercroft of our Ladies Chappell is an ancient Monument thus inscribed, Ioane de Borwaschs dame de Moun. Ioane Lad, Burwas . thus surnamed of Burwash a towne in Sussex, wherein she inhabited, which likewise gaue name to Sir Bartholomew Burwash, Lamb. peramb. Knight of the Garter, Constable of Douer Castle, and Lord Warden of the Cinque ports. Here lieth interred Isabell de Douer, Isabel Coun∣tesse of Atholl. Countesse of Assyle, as Stow calls her, but I thinke there is a mistaking of Assyle for Atholl, as will partly ap∣peare by the sequele. Fulbert Lord of Chilham, had one onely daughter and heire, whom Richard the base sonne of King Iohn tooke to wife, Camden, in this Tract. by whom he had two daughters, Lora the wife of William Marmion, and Isabell wife to Dauid of Stratbolgy, Earle of Atholl, and afterwards to Sir Alexander Baliol, who was called to Parliament by the name of Lord of Chillham, and mother to that Iohn, Earle of Athol, who being condemned oftentimes for treason, was hanged at the last vpon a gibbet fiftie foot high; as King Edward the first commanded, Stow Annal. because he might be so much the more conspicuous in mens eyes, as he was of higher and nobler birth, being of the Kings bloud. Lora was secondly married to one of the Lord Berkeleyes Ancestours, if we may giue any credit to these ancient rimes. Robert of Glocester. Sir Richard the Fitz-Roy of wham we spak by for Gentilman he was inough though he wer last ibor. For the Erles doughter of Warren his good modir was, And his fadir Kyng Iohn, that by gat hym a perchas, Sir Morreys of Berkele wedded suth by cas, His doughter, and wan on hur the good knyght Sir Tho∣mas. This Isabell deceased at Chilham here in Kent, in the moneth of Febru∣ary, Ann. Dom. 1292. Cuthert Arch¦bishop of Cant. The first Archbishop that I finde to be buried in this Church was Cuth∣bert, or Cudbrict (for before him they were alwayes buried at Saint Au∣gustines ) an Englishman of great parentage, translated from Hereford, the yeare 742. to this seate of Canterbury. Godwin, do Ptaeful. Aug. In whose time the Laitie were wic∣ked, and the Clergie worse; the whole land was ouerwhelmed with a most darke and palpable mist of ignorance, and polluted with all kinde of im∣pietie. Which to reforme, hee called together a Synode of Bishops and learned men at Cloueshoo (now Cliffe at Hoo) beside Rochester, Lamb. ye amb. and there, after long consultation, caused one and thirtie Canons to bee decreed, one of which was, That the Priests were required to reade to their Parishoners the Lords prayer, and the Creed in the English tongue: which, with the rest, De ges Pon¦tis. lib. 1. you may reade in William Malmesbury. This Bishop obtained from the Pope a dispensation for making of Coemiteries, or Churchyards, with∣in Townes and Cities, whereas vntill his time within the walls none were buried; Appendix Cron. Rotsen. in bib. Cot. as I haue it thus in a Manuscript. Cutbertus Archiepiscopus Cant. xi. ab Augustino cum Rome videret plures intra Ciuitates sepeliri, rogauit Papam vt sibi liceret cemiteria facere, guod Papa annuit, reuersus itaque ce∣miteria vbique in Anglia fieri constituit. He died, Ann. Dom. 758. Odo Seuerus Archbishop I finde little of any other Bishop here buried, vntill the time of Odo Se∣uerus who lyeth here interred vnder a Tombe of Touchstone (surnamed Seuerus of the austeritie of his life and gouernment) borne of Danish pa∣rents, Pagans, and vtter enemies of Christ and Christian religion, insomuch that they disinherited this their Sonne Odo, for keeping companie with Christians, Godwin de Praef. Ang. so that he was constrained to forsake his fathers house, his kin∣dred, and countrey, and betake himselfe to the seruice of a Nobleman in the Court of King Edward the elder, named Ethelelm, who set him to schoole, where he profited exceedingly. He was not baptised till hee was come to mans estate: soone after his baptisme, by the aduise of Ethelelm his Master, he entred into orders; yet before he came to bee a Clergie man, he serued in the warres, which is not vnlikely, saith mine Authour, for after he was Bishop he was thrice in the field, Antiquit. Brit. M. Parker. and did his Prince notable seruice. He was first preferred to the Bishopricke of Wilshire (whose See was then seated at Ramsbury) by the speciall fauour of King Athelstan ; who being dead, his brother Edmund, who succeeded him in his kingdome, louing him no lesse, procured him to be chosen Archbishop. In which pastorall charge hee continued many yeares in great fauour, and authoritie, vnder diuers Princes, till towards the latter end of his time, that Edwin a young King was sore exasperated against him, for that this Bishop had caused him to be diuorced from his Queene, for consanguinitie, or some other reasons, and excommunicated his Concubines, causing one of them, whom the king doted vpon, to be fetcht out of the court by violence, to bee burnt in the forehead with an hote iron, and banished into Ireland. But not long after he was taken away by death from the Kings displeasure, Io. Bale. Cent. 2 in the yeare of our redemption, 958. hauing sate Archbishop 25. yeares, or thereabouts. He writ diuers Tractates both in verse and prose, Io. Capg. in vita S. Odonis. mentioned by Bale, and Cap∣graue, will haue him in the Kalender of our English Saints and Confes∣sours. But to conclude, such was his Epitaph. Stemmate serenus iacet hic sacer Odo Seuerus: Ex vet. Miss. in bib. Cot. Moribus excellens acriter peccata refellens. Presul at indulgens omni pictate refulgens. Ecclesie & Christi Pugil inuictissimus isti. O bone nunc Christe quia sic tibi seruijt iste Celi solamen sibi des te deprecor. Amen. The life and death of this Archbishop Lanfranck is set downe at large by William Malmsbury, Lanfrank Arch∣bishop of Cant. Io. Capgraue, Nicholas Harpsfeild, Archdeacon of Canterbury, Mathew Parker, Archbishop, with others, and out of them all by Francis Godwin, now Bishop of Hereford. Yet for method sake thus much, because I find his body (by a Table inscribed which hangs vpon his Tombe) to be here interred. He was borne in Italy, at Pauia, some twenty miles from Myllaine, brought vp in the Monasterie of Becco in Norman∣die, vnder Herlewin the learned Abbot of that house, of which he became Prior: from whence, in regard of his singular wisedome, and great know∣ledge in all good literature, he was called by William the Duke of Nor∣mandie to be Abbot of Saint Stephens in Cane, a Monasterie that the said Duke had founded. And in the fifth yeare after his conquest of England, he promoted him to this Archbishopricke, which he laudablie gouerned the space of eighteene yeares. It is said (an action which much obscured all his former praises) that he perswaded the Conquerour to leaue the kingdome of England to his younger sonne William Rufus: which they said William thus requited; the Bishop (as the King thought) being somewhat too bu∣sie in reprehending his manifold vices, and exhorting him to godlinesse and vertue; he so bitterly fell out with him, that he banished him the Realme; the poore old bishop trauelled to Rome; and wandred vp and downe many countries, till by intercession of friends hee was suffered to returne home; and soone after died of an ague, Harpsfeld Vn∣dec. secul ca. 1 . according to his owne desire. Solebat enim Deum rogare vt velex dissenteria vel ex febri diem suum obiret, propterea quod hi morbi nec memoriam, nec loquelam auferant. He would often desire God that he might take his end either by a fluxe, or an ague: for that in those kinde of infirmities men are wont to haue the vse both of speech and memorie to the last cast. Floren Higorn. His death happened the 24. of May, Ann. Dom. 1089. He bestowed much vpon the fabricke of this Church, and the hou∣sing of the Monkes: he built in a manner all the Archbishops pallace, hee founded two Hospitals adioyning to this Citie, hee gaue great summes of money, and also a Mannor toward the building of the Cathedrall Church of Rochester, and did much for the Abbey of Saint Albons. Hee encreased the number of the Monkes of this Church, from thirty to fourty, restored the dignities and offices of old belonging to the Monasterie, and recouered vnto the same 25. Manors that had beene taken from it wrongfully in times past, Pitseus. Bale. Centuria se∣cunda. by Odo Bishop of Bayon, and Earle of Kent. Hee was a pro∣found Scholler for those times; he writ the noble acts of the Conquerour, he made learned Comments and Expositions of many parts of the Bible, and tooke great paines in reforming the same, the copies whereof were much corrupted throughout all England, by the negligent ouer-sight of the writers. To his memorie this Epitaph was composed. Serlo Parisiensis Mss. in bib. Cot. Vixisti venerande Pater sapienter, & egens, Vixisti, vivens mors quoque vita tibi. Inter diuitias pauper Lanfrance fuisti. Diuitijs manans pauperum amator eras. Per te florentes artes valuere latine; Grecia sis nobis ecce triumphat ouans. Tu Laios ortu, Gallosque docendo leuasti, Te sibi Primatem cardo Britannus habet. In terra degens celestia regna petebas, Exemptus terra sider a liber adis. Sol geminos denis obsiderat igne diebus, Promsit Luna diem, nocte solutus abis. Anselme Arch∣bishop. Here is the Tombe of Archbishop Anselme, borne in Augusta a Citie of Burgundie, who followed his predecessours steps almost foot by foot. First he came to Becco vpon the like errand as Lanfrank had done; which was to obtaine knowledge in all good learning: Antiquitales Brilan in vita Ans. Lanfrancke being called away to Cane, he was made Prior of Becco in his place, and afterwards Abbot, in which he continued 15. yeares, vntill at the request of Hugh Earle of Che∣ster, he came ouer into England; and had this Bishopricke bestowed vpon him, some foure yeares after the decease of Lanfrancke (for so long the king pursed vp the profits thereof) by William Rufus ; who presently after his consecration fell out with his new Bishop, and banished him the king∣dome; in which he trauelled vp and downe as an exile during the Kings life, vntill by his brother King Henry the first, he was called home, and re∣stored to all his former dignities. Godwin. de Praef. Aug. But not long after he was likewise banish∣ed the Realme by the said Henry, falling out with him concerning the dis∣posing of Bishoprickes at the Kings pleasure, giuing inuestiture, and pos∣session of them by the staffe, and the ring, within three yeares, by the meanes and mediation of Adela or Alice, Countesse of Blois, the Kings si∣ster, he was restored, not onely to his place, but to all his goods and fruits gathered in the time of his absence. Some two yeares after this his last re∣turne, falling sicke of a languishing disease, hee died Aprill 21. Ann. Dom. 1109. in the sixteenth yeare of his gouernment. Some 400. yeares after, by the procurement of Iohn Morton, one of his Successours, he was canoni∣zed a Saint, and one as worthy that honour as any that euer since his was canonized by the Pope; for, as his life and was for integritie euen admirable, and so was his learning as his works et ex ant do testifie. Now because his Epitaph is either worne out, or was euer wan∣ting, I will be so bold as borrow one for him from one of his owne name, which I haue read vpon a Monument in Parma, in Italie.

In the south part of Saint Thomas Chappell, Arch∣bishop. in a marble Tombe ioy∣ning to the wall, lieth the body of Theobald, Archbishop of this See. Who was chosen to that Grace by the Suffragan Bishops of his owne Prouince, in a Conuocation held at London: he was a Benedictine Monke, and Ab∣bot of Becco; a man of no great learning, but of so gentle and sweet beha∣uiour (being very wise withall) as hee was greatly esteemed of high and low, Kings, Nobles, and Commons; yet howsoeuer he was of an affable milde nature, Antiq. Britan. and faire demeanure, his patience was so greatly moned (vpon good occasion) that he interposed the Popes authoritie; with whom the King was made a partie, Goeh i . in v . so farre, as that his goods and Temporalties were twice confiscate seised into the King hands, and himselfe once banish∣ed the kingdome: which so netled him, that like a tall fellow, Nam laesa pati∣entia fit furor, he interdicted King Stephen, and the whole Realme, and ta∣king aduantage of the time, which was wondrous troublesome, came home and liued in Norfolke, till by the intercession of certaine Bishops, hee was restored. After which hee grew into great fauour with the said King, and was the chiefe meanes of concluding that finall peace at Wallingford, Mat Pa is Ann. 115 . be∣tweene him and Maud the Empresse. Shortly after which, King Stephen died, and Henry, surnamed Fitz empresse, sonne of Geffrey Plantaginet, and Maud the Empresse, succeeded him in the Regalitie, vnder whom this Bi¦shop passed the rest of his dayes quietly in great fauour and estimation: and died, Antiquitales Britan. Ann. 1160. when he had sat Archbishop 22. yeares. Perceiuing his end to approach, he made his Will, and gaue all his goods to the poore, or other like good vses. Of whom this Epitaph was made.

I finde one Richard (for I finde no further of his name) Archbishop of this chaire, Richard Archbishop. to be here interred in our Ladies Chappell, sometime a Bene∣dictine Monk , Prior of the Monasterie of Saint Martins in Douer, a man very libera l, gentle, and wise; for hee so handled the matter, that in all his time he neuer was at odds, or out, either with the Pope or King. The Pope he entertained with often gifts and money, the Kings fauour he retained by yeelding, and conforming himselfe to his pleasure. This man continued in his gouernment, about the space of ten or eleuen yeares. In all which time there happened not any thing of him worthie of memorie; except the controuersie, . Westminst. 11 6. stirre, and tumult betweene him and the Archbishop of Yorke for primacie: and the ordaining of three Archdeacons for his Diocesse, which euer before his time was content with one. ib. ocest. M s. An ill husband hee was for his Church, if wee may beleeue this my old Authour. This Richard (saith he) was a man of great Religion, and also of great wit in his tempo∣rall gouernance; but in defending of his freedome of holy Church, and punishment of excesse, and misbeleeuers, to simple and slow; which is part∣ly approued by the sequele (if the report of his end and death may passe for current truth) how that being a sleepe at his Manor of Wrotham, Britan. there seemed to come vnto him a certaine terrible Personage, . demanding of him who he was, whereunto, when for feare the Archbishop answered nothing. Thou art he (said the other) that hast destroyed the goods of the Church, and I will destroy thee from off the face of the earth; which hauing said, he vanished away. In the morning the Bishop (taking his iourney toward Rochester) related this fearfull vision unto a friend of his by the way, which he had no sooner told, then that hee was taken suddenly with a great cold, and stiffenesse in his limbes, so that they had much adoe to get him so farre as Halling, a house belonging to the Bishop of Rochester, where he tooke his bed; and being horribly tormented with the Chollick, and other griefes, gaue vp the ghost the next night following saue one the 16. of Feb.

Hubert Walter Archbishop: In the South wall of this Church, lieth the body of Hubert Walter, or Walter Hubert, (for such a transmutation of the name I finde to bee vsed) who was borne at West-Derham in Norfolke, Francis Thinne and brought vp vnder Ray∣nulph de Glanfeld, Antiq B tan Godwin. de prae∣ ul. Ang chiefe Iustice of England. The first preferment hee ob∣tained was the Deanrie of Yorke, thence hee was called by King Richard the first, vnto the Bishopricke of Salisbury. Whom he attended in all that long and dangerous voyage into the holy Land; as a Commander, or Co∣lonell of some English forces, Ger. Dorob: by whose valour and his owne, he performed admirable seruice at the siege and surrender of Acon, and other fortified places, H llins. pa 1 2. for which, and for his discreete handling the matter, in procuring 250000. Markes of the Clergie, for the ransome of his Master King Ri∣chard, the said King knew not how to heape honours sufficient vpon him; so that at one time he was Archbishop, the Popes Legate, Lord Chancelor, Lord chiefe Iustice, and high immediate Gouernour vnder him of all his Dominions, both in Wales and England: he was much blamed (and per∣aduenture not vnworthily) for vndertaking so many great offices; For Pluribus intentus minor est ad singula sensus. howsoeuer, ig Heueden neuer any man vsed his authoritie and power more moderate∣ly; faithfull and loyall he was euer to his Prince, louing and very care u l of his countrey, in which he caused many excellent Decrees and Lawes to be established. His house keeping was such, as the expence thereof was thought to be little inferiour to the Kings; hee built a Monasterie at Dur∣ham, the place of his birth, began another at Wulferhampton, encomp ssed the Tower of London with a strong wall; and a deepe Moat, beene ased the reuenewes of his See, adorned it with many sumptuous and sta ely buildings, and procured diuers notable priuiledges for the same; and to re∣paire the bookes and Library of this Church, he gaue the Church of Ha∣legast: he finished a Collegiate Church at Lambeth, of Canons regular, be∣gun by Baldwin his predecessour. Which vpon the complaint of the Monkes of Canterbury to the Pope, was pulled downe to the ground. Ma ny oppositions were betwixt him and the Pope, 119 . and many times he was dis∣countenanced by King Iohn, yet (apparently) he died in both their fauours, at his Manor of Tenham, Iuly 13. 1205. Hauing sat Archbishop twelue yeares sauing foure moneths. Here lieth entombed the body of Stephen Langton Archbishop, Stephen Langton Archbishop. whose election to this See, against the Kings will, was the cause of many calami∣ties within this kingdome, the greatest part whereof fell vpon the Clergie; Of which heare my Authour. Bishop Hubert of Canterbury tho died, Iohn Harding. cap. 142. Wherefore Kyng Iohn vnto the Couent sente, To chose his Iohn Gray Bi∣shop o Nor∣w ch. Clarke, whych they refused and denied, Wherefore the kyng was wroth in his entente; For they disobeyed the lettre whych he sente, For they had chosen Mayster Stephan Langton ; An worthy Clarke, of all disposicion. Whom kyng Iohn then wold not admytte For Romayn Bull, ne for the Prelates prayer, But prisoned some, and some to death commytte, Some he exiled, and theyr eyen clere, And all persounes and Prelates in fere He then put out, and seazed theyr benefice Through all the lande, as his mortall enemyes. The Romysh Byshoppe curssed hym openly And all the realme fully did enterdite, That Sacraments none, therin should occupie. But howsoeuer these mischiefes happened vpon his admittance, yet the man (in regard of his many excellent gifts both of body and minde) was no way to be misliked, but much to be commended, for his religious wise carriage, liuing vnder so violent a King. And in such troublesome vngodly times, to whom this Distichon, taken out of Martials Epigrams, to Traian warfaring vnder Diocletian, was applied, Laudari debes, quoniam sub principe duro, Giraldus Cam∣brens in Praes. ad Steph. Arch. Cant. Temporibusque malis ausus es esse bonus. descended he was from an ancient familie in Lecestershire, brought vp in the Vniuersitie of Paris, greatly esteemed by the King and all the Nobility of France, for his singular and rare learning; made Chancellour of Paris, and Cardinall of Rome: Bule. Cent. 2. S. Chrysogoni. Hee writ many admirable pro∣found workes, and amongst the rest, diuided the Bible into Chapters: in such sort as we now account them; he bestowed much vpon his palace here in Canterbury, and vpon a faire Horologe in the South-crosse Isle. Yet the solemnitie of the translation of Thomas Beckets bones was so chargeable vn∣to him, Godwin. de P sul. Ang. as neither he, nor foure of his successours, were able to recouer the debt, he cast his Church into. He died Iuly 9. 1228. hauing sate Archbishop 22. yeares. Here in this Church, but in what particular place my Author knowes not, Iohn Peckham Archbishop. Iohn Peckham, sometime Bishop of this See lieth buried. This Iohn was borne in Sussex, spent his childhood in the Abbey of Lewes, and was brought up in the Vniuersitie of Oxford, from thence hee went to Paris to study Diuinitie, and after that to Livus to get some knowledge in the Ca∣non Law, Godwin. Catal. without the which Diuinitie was esteemed vnperfect in those dayes: and to better his knowledge, he visited all the Vniuersities of Italie, came to Rome, where, his rare learning being soone perceiued, hee was made by the Pope, Auditor, or chiefe Iudge of his pallace; and so continued till his preferment to Canterbury: for a man of so meane parentage, he was thought to be very stately, both in gesture, gate, words, and all outward shew, yet of an exceeding meeke, facile, inward disposition. Vnto double Beneficed men, and Non-residents he was very strict, Adulterie he punish∣ed very seuerely; he persecuted a Bishop terriblie, for keeping of a Concu∣bine: and one Roger Ham a Priest, he enioyned to three yeares penance for fornication: a sinne predominant in former times among the Clergie. Wit∣nesse these rimes. Greate Lechery and fornication Was in that Harding c 193. King Richards 2 house, and also greate aduoutree Of Paramours was greate consolation Of eche degree, well more of Prelacie Then of the Temporall, or of the Chiualrie. He excommunicated one Sir Osborne Gifford, Knight, for stealing two Nunnes out of the Nunnerie of Wilton; and absolued him vpon these con∣ditions. First, that he should neuer come within any Nunnerie, or in the company of a Nunne, that three Sondayes together he should be whipped in the Parish-Church of Wilton, and as many times in the Market, and Church of Shaftsbury; that he should fast a certaine number of moneths, That he should not weare a shirt of three yeares: And lastly, that he should not any more taken vpon him the habite or title of a Knight, but weare ap∣parell of a russet colour, vntill he had spent three yeares in the holy Land. He died Ann. 1294. very rich, yet founded a Colledge of Canons at Wingham in Kent, Wingham C l∣ledge founded. valued at 84. l. per annum, and aduanced many of his friends to great possessions, whose posteritie haue continued in the state of Knights and Esquires euen vntill our times. He sat Archbishop thirteene yeares and an halfe. His heart was buried at Christ-Church London, retro magnum altare. Here beside the altar of Saint Gregorie, sometime stood a sumptuous Monument, wherein the bones of Robert Winchelsey were entombed, which vpon the reformation of Religion was pulled downe to the ground, lest that the common people, who would needs esteeme him a Saint, might giue him diuine honours. Hee sate Archbishop nineteene yeares, during which time he endured much sorrow, yet finished his dayes in quietness , and great felicitie. The King and the Pope concurring together in his time, exacted many great payments, and inflicted grieuous punishments vpon the Clergie. Whereupon these Satyricall verses were framed. Ecclesiae nauis titubat regni quia clauis Errat, Rex Papa facti sunt vnica capa Hoc faciunt, do, des, Pilatus hic, alter Herodes. Hee liued in banishment two yeares, euen vntill the death of Edward the first, who exiled him vpon surmised Treason, from which hee was called home by Edward his sonne, who restored him to his place, to all his goods, and to all the profits of his Temporalities, receiued in his absence. He was a stout Prelate, and a seuere punisher of sinne; hee boldly opposed himselfe against Piers Gaueston, the Spensers, and other corrupters of the young king; and enforced Iohn Warren Earle of Surrey, to forsweare the company of a certaine beautifull Wench, with the loue of which he was greatly be witch∣ed. Hee maintained many poore Schollers at the Vniuersities with liberall exhibition, and such preferments as fell to his disposition, he bestowed vp∣on men of excellent learning. Vnto all kinde of poore people hee was ex∣ceeding bountifull: his bookes, apparell, and other mou ables (such as they were; for most of his yearely reuenues he euer bestowed in almes-deeds and liberall house keeping) he gaue to this Church of Canterbury, who l st to know more of his life may reade the Catalogue of Bishops, and the per∣ambulation of Kent. He died at Otford his Mannor house, May . 1313. Here lieth entombed Walter Reynolds, alter Reynolds Archbishop. a man but of meane learning; brought vp a Courtier, preferred to the Bishopricke of Worcester, to the offices of Lord Chancellour, and Treasurer of England, and to this Metro∣politane honour of Canterbury by King Edward the second; all which he most disloyally and like a Traitour requited, aiding (vnderhand) the Queene, Mortimer, and their complices, with great summes of money, and forsaking his lawfull Soueraigne, his Master, his Patron, that had aduanced him by so many degrees, vnto an estate so gratiously honourable; but it pleased God that vnthankfull timerousnesse should be his destruction, for being by the said Queene (of whom he stood so greatly in awe) command∣ed to consecrate one Iames Berkley, Bishop of Exceter: and performing the same, he was so reuiled, taunted, and threatned by the Pope, that for griefe and anger together he died, when he had sate Archbishop thirteene yeares, nine moneths and three weekes, the 16. of Nouember, Ann. 1327. as ap∣peares by this inscription vpon his Tombe in the South wall, now hardly to be read. Hic requiescit Dominus Walterus Reynolds prius Episcopus Wigorniensis, & Anglie Cancellarius, deinde Archiepiscopus istius Ecclesie qui obijt 16. die mens. Nouembris Ann. gratie 1327. Simon Mepham Archbishop. Vpon the North side of Saint Anselmes Chappell, in a marble Tombe, lieth Simon Mepham Archbishop of this See, borne in this countrey, Do¦ctor of Diuinitie, and very well learned (as learning went in those dayes) of whom I finde little worthy of relation; for all the time hee sate (which was but fiue yeare and somewhat more) he was euer a wrangling with his Monkes of this Church, and with Io. Graundison Bishop of Exceter; and getting the worse by both, he fell sicke and died, October 12. 1333. Iohn Stratford Archbishop. Here in a goody Tombe of Alabaster on the South side of the high Al∣tar, lieth the body of Iohn Stratford, Archbishop of this Diocesse, borne at Stratford vpon Avon: a man famous for his learning, and good gouern∣ment of his iurisdiction. He was called from the See of Winchester to this place; he was Lord Chancellour of England, and protector of the Realme, in the absence of Edward the third in France; but neuer man enioyed such great honours with lesse comfort. Antiq. Britan. It is written that hee was consecrated vpon the Sonday, called then, Multae tribulationes iustorum, which hee thought boaded or foretold vnto him, how in the whole course of his life, he should finde nothing but trouble; which sell out according to his omi∣nous conceit. For neuer any Archbishop, either before or after him, giuing so little cause, and doing his endeuour to please, was more encombred with vndeserued and often crosses. Godwin The story is ouer-long here to relate, I must referre my Reader to the Catalogue of Bishops. Yet before his end (which happened Anno 1348. hauing beene Archbishop 15. yeares) he had made an end of all his troublesome crosses, and liued certaine yeares quietly; they writ of him that he was a very gentle and mercifull man, rather too remisse then any way rigorous to offenders, and a pitifull man to the poore. He founded a Colledge at Stratford vpon Avon, and endowed the same largely. Iohn Arc bishop. Here lieth obscurely buried Iohn Vfford, brother to that illustrious Knight of the Garter, Robert de Vfford, Earle of Suffolke: brought vp in Cambridge, and made Doctor of Law, promoted first vnto the Deanrie of Lincolne, then to the Chancellourship of England, and lastly to this Arch∣bishopricke. Which he neuer enioyed, being cut off by that plague (which consumed nine parts of the men in England) before hee receiued either his pall, or consecration, Iune the seuenth, Ann. 1348. His next successour, Thomas Bradwardin, lieth buried in the South wall, somewhat darkly; Thomas Arch ishop. preferred to his grace and dignitie, without his owne seeking, or any of his friends endeuours; which he likewise enioye but a very little time. For within fiue weekes and foure dayes after his consecra∣tion, he died at Lambeth (being neuer enthronised at all) Ann. 1349 This man was borne at Heathfeild in Sussex, and brought vp in the Vniuersitie of Oxford, where he proceeded Doctor of Diuinitie; and so exquisite a Di∣uine he was, . that he was commonly enstiled Doctor Profundus. He was a good Mathematician, a great Philosopher, and a generall Scholler in all the liberall Sciences, as his workes not yet perished do testifie. In whole praise thus Chaucer speakes in the Nunnes Priests tale. But I ne cannot boult it to the bren, As can the holy Doctor Saynt Austin, Or Boece or the Bishop Bradwardin. But aboue all, he is especially commended for his sinceritie of life and con∣uersation. He was Confessour to Edward the third, and in all his warres of France, was neuer from him; and though he might haue had many pre∣ferments of the King, yet he was so farre from ambitious desire of promo∣tion, as it was long before he could be perswaded to take a Prebend of Lin∣colne, when it was offered him. Well we will leaue him to his rest, onely re∣membred with this Epitaph. Doctor Doctorum Bradwardin hac iacet vrna, Ex vet, M s Anon. in bib. Cot. Norma Pastorum laudabilis & diuturna. Qui inuidia caruit vitam sine crimine duxit, Et ex ore suo quicquid sit scibile fluxit. Nullus sub sole est cui sic fuere omnia nota. Cantia nunc dole, tristeris & Anglia tota. Vos qui et transitis, hic omnes atque reditis, Dicite quod Christi pietas sit promptior isti. Simon Islip brought vp in Merton Colledge in Oxford, Simon Islip Archbishop. being Doctor of Law became Canon of Paules, then Deane of the Arches, after that was chosen to be of the priuie Councell to King Edward the third; first in the place of Secretarie, and then Keeper of the priuie Seale And lastly, by the Monkes election, the Popes approbation, and the Kings good liking; hee was aduanced to this grace and dignitie. Wherein hee continued sixteene yeares, foure moneths, and twelue dayes: and died April 26. 1366. he lieth buried in the middle of the Church, vnder a marble Tombe inlaid with brasse, whereon is engrauen this Epitaph. Simon Islip oriens, vir bina lege probatus, Vt nascens, moriens sic nunc iacet arcte locatus, Arcem qui tenuit hic quondam Pontificatus , Clero quique fuit regno toti quoque gratus.

He was a very seuere corrector of sinne, depriuing many Clergie-men of their liuings, in the first visitation of his owne Diocesse. He repaired his pallace, with 1101. l. and odde money, which he recouered of Andrew Vfford, Archdeacon of Midlesex, admin stratour of Iohn Vfford his prede∣cessour, for dilapidations, Godw n. hee built and endowed with good possessions a Colledge in this Citie, which is now become a parcell of Christ-church in Oxford. He bequeathed to his Church a thousand sheepe, his vestments, which were all cloth of gold, a very sumptuous Coape, and much plate; he was a very ugall and sparing man, neuer esteeming pompe nor out∣ward brauery, which he shewed at his end, desiring to be buried obscure∣ly to auoid superfluous expence. William Wittle∣ ey Archbishop William Wittlesey succeeded the said Simon, and was brought vp at Ox∣ford, at the charges of Simon Islip who was his Vnkle, where hee procee∣ded Doctor of the Canon Law, and by him sent to Rome to sollicite his causes, and also to get experience by seeing the practise of that Court: who after he had stayed there a time was called home, and preferred by his Vn∣kles meanes, vnto the place of Vicar generall, then to the Deanrie of the Arches, the Archdeaconrie of Huntington, the Parsonages of Croydon, and Cliff; to the Bishopricke of Rochester, from thence to Worcester; and lastly (after the decease of his said Vncle) to this Archbishopricke of Can∣terbury, in which he continued almost seuen yeares, being the most of his time troubled with a tedious lingring disease, whereof he died Iuly 5. 1374. He lieth buried ouer against his Vncle betweene two pillars, vnder a mar∣ble Tombe inlaid with brasse, which with his Epitaph is altogether defa∣ced, the brasse worne, torne or stolne away; these few words onely remai∣ning. ............ tumulatus Wittelesey natus gemmata luce..... Sudburie natus Simon iacet hic tumulatus Martirizatus nece pro republica stratus. Heu scelus infernum, trux, exitiale, nefandum, Presulis eximij corpus venerabile dandum In rabiem Vulgi......... This is a fragment of an Epitaph, composed to the memory of Simon Tibold, the sonne of one Nigellus Tibold, surnamed Sudbury of a Towne in Suffolke, where he was borne; a Doctor of the Canon Law, who by degrees came to this Metropolitan Grace of Canterbury. A man very wise, learned, eloquent, liberall, mercifull, and wondrous reuerend: all which could not deliuer him from vntimely death. For he, together with Sir Ro∣bert Hales, Lord Prior of Saint Iohns Ierusalem, and Chancellour or Eng∣land, were haled to the Tower-hill, by the Rebels of Kent, and Essex, with infernall shouts and yells, and there vniustly ( Nam ius calcatur viol tia cum dominatur ) and horriblie hack , hewed, and in that barbarous man∣ner beheaded by these arch Tray ours, Iune the fourteenth, the yeare of our Lord, 1381. and of the raigne of that vnfortunate King Richard the se∣cond, the fourth; hauing sate Bishop about six yeares. Which lamentable storie the Chronicles at large declare. When these hurlie burlies were at an end, the body of this good Archbishop was conueyed to his owne Church, and there honourablie inte ed vpon the South side of the Altar of Saint Dunstan. This Bishop built the West-gate of this Citie, and the wall from that gate vnto the North-gate, commonly called by the name of the long wall, and would haue done likewise about all the Towne, if hee had liued. The Maior and the Aldermen once a yeare vsed to come solemnly to his Tombe to pray for his soule, in memory of this his good deed to their Citie, saith Leland in his Commentaries. It was the custome of old, and so it is in these dayes, for men of eminent ranke and qualitie to haue Tombes erected in more places then one; for ex∣ample and proofe of my speech, I finde here in this Church a Monument of Alabaster, at the feete of the blacke Prince, wherein, both by tradition and writing, it is affirmed that the bones of William Courtney (the sonne of Hugh Courtney, the third of that Christian name, Earle of Deuonshire▪ Archbishop of this See, lies entombed. And I finde another, to the memory of the same man, at Maidstone here in Kent, wherein (because of the Epi∣taph) I rather beleeue that his body lieth buried; Of which hereafter when I come to that Towne. Here lieth interred vnder a faire Monument, Thomas Arun¦d ll Arch∣bishop. Thomas Fitz-Alan, or Arundell, the third sonne of Richard Fitz-Alan, Earle of Arundell, Warren, and Surrey, by Eleanor his wife, daughter of Henry Plantaginet, Earle of Lancaster, as I haue it in the Catalogue of Honour. Who at the age of two and twenty yeares was consecrated Bishop of Ely: An old Bishop which hee laudablie gouerned (considering the greennesse of his age) the space of fourteene yeares, three moneths, and eighteene dayes. In which time hee was Lord Chancellour of England; from Ely he was translated to Yorke; leauing for an implement at his house of Ely, a wonderfull sumptuous and costly Table, adorned with gold and precious stones, which belonged first to the King of Spaine, Godwi . and was sold to this Bishop by the blacke Prince for three hundred Markes. Hee also bestowed the building of the great Gate∣house of Ely house in Houlborne: during his abode at Yorke, which was about eight years, he bestowed much in building vpon diuers of his houses, and vnto the Church. Besides many rich ornaments, he gaue two great Ba∣sons of siluer and gilt, two great Censers, two other Basons of siluer, and two Creuetts; he gaue to the Vicars, a siluer cup of great waight, and a massie bowle of siluer to the Canons. From Yorke he was remoued hither to Canterbury, and here he sate one moneth aboue seuenteene yeares. In which time, at the West end of his Church, hee built a faire spi e steeple▪ called to this day, Arundell steeple, and bestowed a tunable ring of fiue bels vpon the same, Antiq. Britan. which he dedicated to the holy Trinity, to the blessed Vir∣gine Mary, to the Angell Gabriel, to Saint Blase, and the fifth to S. Iohn Euangelist. Thus much he effected: howsoeuer hee was no sooner warme in his seate, Lanquet. Hollins. then that he with his brother, the Earle of Arundell, were con∣demned of high Treason, his brother executed, and he banished the king∣dome; and so liued in exilement the space of neare two yeares, vntill the first of the raigne of Henry the fourth. This worthy Prelate died of a swelling in his tongue, which made him vnable to eate, drinke, or speake for a time before his death. Which hap∣pened Februar. 20. Ann. 1413.

Vpon his restauration to this his Bishopricke, by Henry the fourth Duke of Lancaster, the same Author thus writes. Iustos laudauit, iniustos vituperauit, Hos confirmauit, hos deprimit, hos releuauis. Regni primatem crudelem per feritatem Quem Rex explantat, Dux ex pietate replantat. Henry Chichley, Bishop of this See, lies here on the North side of the Presbitery, in a Tombe built by himselfe in his life time: hee was borne at Higham errys in Northamptonshire, where he began the foundation of a goodly Colledge, and an Hospitall, which were finished by his two bre∣thren, his Executours. Hee was brought vp in New Colledge in Oxford, where he proceeded Doctor of Law, and where he founded two Colledges, one called Bernard Colledge, renewed by Sir Thomas White, and named Saint Iohns Colledge: and all Soules Colledge, which yet continueth in the same estate he left it, one of the fairest in that Vniuersitie. Hee was em∣ployed much in embassages by King Henry the fourth, who preferred him to the Bishopricke of Saint Dauids ; where he sate fiue yeares, and was then translated hither by his sonne King Henry the fifth. He was a man happie, enioying alwayes his Princes fauour, wealth, honour, and all kinde of pros∣perity many yeares, wise in gouerning his See worthily, bountifull in be∣stowing his goods to the behoofe of the common-wealth. And lastly stout and seuere in due administration of iustice. When hee had gouerned this Sec. 29. yeares (a longer time then euer any did in fiue hundred yeares be∣fore him) he died April 12. Ann. 1443. Vpon whose Monument I finde this Epitaph. Hic iacet Hen: Chicheley L. Doctor, quondam Cancellarius Sarum, ui anno 7. Hen. 4.

I finde another more vnlearned Epitaph of him, by which he is but little honoured, being such an especiall furtherer of learning. Pauper eram natus, post Primas hic euatus. am sum prostratus, & vermi paraius. Ecce meum tumulum. M.CCCC.XLIII. Iohn Stafford Archbishop. Here lies interred in the Martyrdome an Archbishop, very noble, and no lesse learned, one of the honourable familie of the Staffords ; sonne (saith the Catalogue of Bishops) vnto the Earle of Stafford, but I finde no such thing in all the Catalogues of Honour; a man much fauoured by King Hen∣ry the fifth, wo preferred him first to the Deanrie of Wells, gaue him a Prebend in the Church of Salisbury, made him one of his priuie Councell, and in the end Treasurer of England. And then although this renowned King was taken away by vntimely death, yet hee still went forward in the way of promotion, and obtained the Bishopricke of Bath and Welles, which with great wisedome hee gouerned eighteene yeares, from whence he was remoued to this of Canterbury, in which he sate almost nine yeares; and in the meane time was made Lord Chancellour of England, which office hee held eighteene yeares (which you shall hardly finde any other man to haue done) vntill waxing wearie of so painfull a place, he volunta∣rily resigned it ouer into the Kings hands. And about three yeares after that died at Maidstone, Iuly 6. Ann. 1452. Vpon a flat marble stone ouer him I finde this consabulatorie Epitaph. Quis fuit enuclees quem celas saxe moles? Stafford Antistes. fuerat dictusque Iohannes. Qua sedit sede marmor queso simul ede? Pridem Bathonie, Regni totius & inde Primas egregius. Pro presule funde precatus Aureolam gratus huic det de Virgine natus. Much more may be read of this Bishop in the booke called, Antiqui∣tates Britannicae, penned by Mathew Parker, Archbishop of this place, and in the Catalogue of Bishops, by Francis Godwin, Bishop of Hereford▪ as also in the Catalogues of the Lords Chancellours and Treasurers of Eng∣land, collected by Francis Thinne. In a decent Monument on the South side of the Presbitery, Iohn Kempe, Archbishop of this See, Iohn Kempe Archbishop. lieth interred, who was borne at Wye in this County of Kent, brought vp at Oxford in Merton Colledge, where hee proceeded Doctor of Law. Hee was made first Archdeacon of Durham, then Deane of the Arches, and Vicar generall vnto the Archbishop Staf∣ford. Not long after he was aduanced to the Bishopricke of Rochester, re∣moued thence to Chichester, from Chichester to London, from London to Yorke, from Yorke to Canterbury: he was first Cardinall of the title of Saint Balbine, and from that remoued to the title of Saint Rusine ; all which his Ecclesiasticall preferments were comprehended in this one verse, com∣posed by his cosin Thomas Kempe, Bishop of London. Bis Primas ter Praesul erat, bis Cardine functus. And to adde to all these honours, he was twice Lord Chancellour of Eng∣land. He continued not here aboue a yeare and a halfe, but died a very old man, March 22. 1453. hee conuerted the Parish-Church of Wye into a Colledge of secular Priests. Of which hereafter. In a little history of the Archbishops of Yorke, written in rythmicall numbers, I finde these in his commendations. Tunc Iohannes nobilis Kemp vociferatus, Prius in Londonijs Presul installatus. Et erectus Pontifex Metropolitanus. Presul Archipresulem confirmat Romanus, Mandans sibi pallium Martinus; erectus Sagax Cancellarius Regis est effectus. Cardinalis Presbiter digne sublimatur. Sub Balbine Titulo, sic laus cumulatur. In Suthwell manerium fecit preciosum, Multis artificibus valde sumptuosum, Annis multis prospere curam sui gregis, Rexit per iusticiam, & per normam legis. Tandem vsque Cantiam Presul est translatus Illic Archiepiscopus est inthronizatus Apud Lambeth obijt labor iam finitur, Et in Cantuaria corpus sepelitur, Licet prohibuerit Abbas rigorose Iacet ibi condita gleba gloriose. I finde little of any great worke or deede of charitie this Bishop perfor∣med (besides his Manor of Suthwell here onely mentioned) with all these his pennisome preferments. but the reason is giuen in the Catalogue of Bi∣shops, that he died very rich, and that in his life time he aduanced many of his kindred to great wealth, and some to the dignitie of knighthood, whose posteritie continued yet in this County, of great worship and reputation, euen to this day. That he might die very rich I doe not denie, but for the aduancement of his kindred to the honour of knighthood, was no other title then his grandfather Sir Iohn Kempe, and his Vncle Sir Roger enioyed: his owne father Thomas being a younger brother to the said Sir Roger. Here lieth buried (as by an inscription vpon a marble doth appeare) Thomas Bourchier, Tho Archbishop. commonly called Bowser, second sonne of William Bour∣chier, Earle of Ewe in Normandie, and brother to Henry Bourchier Earle of Ewe and Essex. He was brought vp in Oxford preferred to the Deanrie of Saint Martins, then to the Bishop o Worcester, from whence he was translated to Ely; and in this chaire of Canterbury, wherein he sate 32. yeares, and the time of his first consecration 51. yeares. I finde not Englishman continued so long a Bishop, or that any Archbishop, before or after him, in eight hundred yeares enioyed that place so long. And to adde more honour to his Grace, and money to his purse, he was about two yeares Lord Chan∣celour of England, atal. of Chancellour. and Cardinall tt. S. Ciriaci in Thermis, t all this time for all these great and eminent promotions, he left nothing behinde him to continue his memorie, but an old rotten chest in the congregation house at Cambridge, called Billingsworth and Bowser, into which (for the vse of the Vniuersitie) Billingsworth before him had put in one hundred pounds, and he (forsooth) imitating that munificent example, put in one hundred and twenty pounds. He died March 30. 1486. as appeared by ption vpon his Monument. Hic iacet reuerendissimus pater & Dominus D. Thomas quo dam sacrosancte Romane Ecclesie S. Ciriaci in Thermi chiepiscopus huius Ecclesie, qui obijt 30. die Marty 1486. pro∣pitietur altissimus. Iohn Morton Archbishop: Here lieth buried vnder a marble stone, in a sumptuous Chappell vnder the Quier, of his owne building, Iohn Morton, borne (to the good of all England) at Beere (at Saint Andrews Milborn, md. Dorset. saith Camde ) in Dorset∣shire, brought vp in Oxford, where he proceeded Doctor of the Ciuill and Canon Law; he was first Parson of Saint Dunstans in London, and Pre∣bendarie of Saint Decumanes in Wales, then Bishop of Ely, Master of the Rolles, Lord Chancellour of England, Cardinall of Saint Anastatia, and Archbishop of this Metropolitan See. A man so well deseruing both of the Church and common-wealth, that all honours and offices were too little which were conferred vpon him: of a piercing naturall wit he was, very well learned, and honorable in behauiour, lacking no wise wayes to winne loue and fauour, by whose deepe wisedome and pollicie, the two houses of Yorke and Lancaster (whose titles for a long time had mightily disquieted the whole kingdome) were happily vnited; but our English Chronicles are so full and copious in this Bishops commendation, as that I know not where to begin with him, nor how to take my leaue of him. Whilest he was Bishop of Ely (which was about eight yeares) hee be∣stowed great cost vpon his house at Hatfield in Hertfordshire, Antiq. Britan. (now the mansion place of that right honourable Lord, and one of the priuie Coun∣cell, William Cecill, Earle of Salisbury) and at Wisbich Castle in Cam∣bridgeshire (a house belonging to that See) all the bricke-building was done at his charges And in the time of his Primacie in this Church, he be∣stowed great summes in repairing and augmenting his houses at Knoll, Maydstone, Godwin. Alington Parke, Charing, Ford, Lambith, and Canterbury. He bequeathed by his last Will, in a manner, all that hee had, either vnto good vses, or to such of his seruants as he had yet beene able to do nothing for. He gaue to the King a Portuis, to the Queene a , to the dy Margaret his God daughter (afterwards married to , King of Scotland) a cup of gold, and tourry p unds in Church of Ely, his Myter and Crolle; vnto his and giue nothing, as hauing sufficie tly pref rre them in his which family, Robert, Bishop of Worcester, and many of very good note and qualitie in Dorsetshire, and . His Ex ecutors he bound by oath to maintaine sufficiently at Oxford, and ten at Cambridge, for the space of twenty decease And it is not to be forgotten, that the yeare before he died, great charges he procured Anselme, one of his predeces ours, to be nized a Saint. This good man died at his Manour of , in the of October, 1500. hauing enioyed this Archbishopricke en yeares in all quietnesse. I finde no memoriall of him vpon his please you then to let these lines following serue for an Eulogium or Epi∣taph. Iohannes Morton postquam Cantuariensem Prouinciam 13. Ann. rexisset, obijt.

Vnder a faire marble stone in the martyrdome, inlaid with brasse, in erred the body of Henry Deane, an Oxford man, Doctor of Diuia , sometimes Abbot of Lanthony, Chancellour of Ireland, Bishop of translated to Salisbury; and within two yeares after, aduanced to this of Canterbury. He was a very wise industrious man, by who e care and diligence, during his abode in Ireland, Perkin Wa b ck, who coun∣t rfei ed himselfe to bee Richard the young Duke of Yorke, was forced to flie from thence into Scotland; He recouered diuers parcels of land to his Se of Bangor, which were lost by his predecessours, for want of good loo king to: amongst other, a certaine Island betweene Holy-head and An g esey, called Mo lr. homicit, or the Island of Seales. Hee bestowed much money in repairing his Church and pallace at Bangor, which had beene burned and destroyed long before by Owen Glendow , that famous rebell during the time he sate here Archbishop (which was scarce two yeares) h built the most part of Otford house, and made the iron worke vpon th coping of Rochester Bridge. He bequeathed to his Church a siluer image, of one and fiftie ounces waight, and appointed fiue hundred pounds to bee bestowed vpon his funeralls. Hee died, Februar. the fifteenth, at Lambith▪ Ann. 1502. as appeares by his Epitaph. Hic sub marmore iacet corpus reuerendissmi in Christo patris et Domini D.

In a little Chappell built by himselfe, lieth William Warham, William Warham Archbishop Archbi∣shop of this See. A gentleman of an ancient house in Hampshire, brought vp in the Colledge of Winchester, and chosen thence to the new Colledge in Oxford, Godwin. where he proceeded Doctor of Law. Presently vpon which, he practised as an Aduocate in the Arches, then hee was Parson of Barley in Hertfordshire as I finde in that Church-windowes, and Master of the Rols. He was sent Embassadour by Henry the seuenth, to the Duke of Burgundy, concerning the two counterfeits, Lambert, and Perkin Warbeck, which the Duchesse his wife had set vp against him. In which businesse hee behaued himselfe so wisely, as the King highly comm nded him, and preferred him vpon his returne, to the Bishopricke of London; and vpon the death of Henry Deane, to this of Canterbury. He was also made Lord Chancellour of England by the same King; in which office he continued, vntill hee was wrung out by Wolsey, Mat. Pa ke . Antiq. B itan. the seuenth of Henry the eight. The ceremony of his inthronization to Canterbury was performed in a most magnificent man∣ner: the Duke of Buckingham, and many other great men of the kingdome being that day his officers. In his solemne and sumptuous feast, all his ho∣nours and offices were drawne, depicted, or delineated, after a strange man∣ner, in gilded Marchpaine vpon the banqueting dishes: and first because he was brought vp in the Vniuersitie of Oxford, the Vicechancelour with the Bedels before him, and a multitude of Schollars following him, were de∣scribed to present to the King and the Nobilitie, sitting in Parliament, this William Warham with this laudatorie Tetrasticon. Deditus à teneris studijs hic noster alum us, Morum et Doctrinae tantum profecit, vt Aulam Illustrare tuam, curare negotia Regni (Rex Henrice) tui possit honorifice. Which the King seemes to answer thus. Tales esse decent quibus vti sacra maiestas Regnum in tutando debeat imperio. Quare suscipiam quem commendastis Alumnum Digna daturus ei praemia pro meritis. Rolles some∣time a house of Conuert , de∣dicated to the blessed Virgin. Then these verses vpon his preferment to the Mastership of the Rolls. Est locus egregius tibi virgo sacrata dicatus, Publica seruari quo monumenta solent. Hic primo hunc situ dignabere dignor honore Commendo fidei scrinia sacra suae. Then vpon his aduancement to London these. Vrbis Londini cap O duleiss me Paule Hic regat, et seruet Pastor ouile tuum. And againe. Hic nisi praeclara morum indole praeditus esset, Haud peteretur ei tantus honoris apex. Then of his consecration and installation to this See, many verses were composed to explaine the Artifice, to this effect. O Wilhelme veni Domini sis cult r agelli, Esto memor qui honor, quae tibi cura datur. Est minor ista tuis sedes virtutibus, illa * Thomae digna uis est potius meritis. And lastly (to omit a great many) the manner of the deliuerie of his pall (which is an Episcopall vestment com ing be sho lders, made of a sheepskinn , in memoriall that ; and ha∣uing the same, laid it pon his shoulders, with crosses, first laid vpon Saint Peters coffin or crowned, sitting in his glistering Throne, encompassed with his of Cardinals: which he presents with this Dis chon. Amplior hic meritis simili potiatur honore Suppleat et vestrum sede vacaute . The words at the deliuerie of the Pall to him, or to any other Bisho were these. Ad honorem Dei omnipotentis et B. Mariae Virginis, ac B . P tri et Pa li Apostolorum, et Domini nostri Alex. Pp. sex. et S.

Pontisi ali vtaris Ecclesiam tuam certis diebus qui exprimuntur in priuileg s i ab Apos lic sede concessis. The Pall being receiued, the Bishop takes his oath vnto the Pope in these words. Ego W. W.

Possessiones vero ad mensam mei Archiepiscopatus pertinentes non vendam, neque donabo, neque impignerabo, neque de nouo insendabo, vel ali∣quo modo alienabo inconsulto Rom. Pontifice sicut me Deus adiuuet, &c. The crosse was deliuered vnto him by a Monke of this his Church in these words. Godwin. Reuerend Father, I am the messenger of the great King, that doth re∣quire and command you to take on you the gouernment of his Church, and to loue and defend the same, in token whereof, I deliuer you this his ensigne. But I doubt I am tedious, I will draw to his end, which happened, August 23. 1532. after hee had continued Archbishop eight and twentie yeares, and was buried without any great funerall pompe, mourning clothes being giuen onely to the poore. Hee purchased much land for his kindred, and bestowed very much in repairing and beautifying his houses with faire buildings, euen to the value of thirtie thousand pounds, as hee professeth; for which cause hee prayed his Successours to forbeare sute for dilapidations. His motto I finde in many places of the pallace, which was, Auxilium meum à Domino. I finde no more Archbishops to bee here buried, saue Cardinall Poole, whom I reserue for another booke. Sir William Molyneux Knight Ban∣neret. Here sometimes was a monument erected to the memory of that valiant Knight, Sir William Molyneux, of Seston in Lanchishire, who at the bat∣tell of Nauarret in Spaine, was made knight Banneret, by Edward the black Prince, Anno 1367. vnder whose command he serued in those warres, as al∣so for a long time, in the warres of France. From whence returning home∣wards, he died here at Canterbury, Anno 1372. Whose Epitaph I haue out of the pedegree of that honourable worthy gentleman, Sir Richard Molyneux of Seston, Knight and Baronet, and Viscount Marybourgh in Ireland, now liuing, who from the said Sir William is lineally descended. Miles honorificus Molyneus subiacet intus; Tertius Edwardus dilexit hunc vt amicus: Fortia qui gessit, Gallos, Nauar osque repressit, Hic cum recessit, morte feriente decessit, Anno milleno trecento septuageno, Atque his iunge duo: sic perit omnis home.

Camden tells vs that this familie of the Guildfords is very ancient, but most eminent, euer since this Sir Iohn Guil∣ford (here interred) was Controuler to the house to King Edward the fourth; whose sonne and heire Sir Richard, was, by King Henry the seuenth, made Knight of the Garter: of his sonnes againe Sir Edward Guilford was Marshall of Callais, Lord Warden of the Cinque-ports, and Master of the Ordnance, father to I ne Dutches of Northumberland, wife to Sir Iohn Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, mother of the late Earles of Wa wick, and Leicester; of Guilford Dudley, beheaded with his wife the Lady Iane ; and of fiue sonnes and eight daughters besides: and Sir Henry was chosen Knight of the Garter by King Henry the eight, and had his armes ennobled with a Canton of Granado by Ferdinando, King of Spaine, for his worthy seruice in that kingdome, when it was recouered from the Moores; and Edward liued in great esteeme in his countrey: To be briefe, from this Sir Iohn Guilford are issued by females immediatly, the Darells, Gages, Brew es, Walsinghams, Cromers, Isaacs, and Iselcies, families of prime and principall note in these parts. But I digresse, and I craue pardon. Onely let me tell you, that Sir Richard Guilford, aforesaid, serued King Henry the seuenth, s pra mare cum 550. Nautis et Soldarijs pre duos menses. 5. Hen. 7.

And I finde one Sir Iohn Fogge, a warriour, in the beginning of the raigne of King Henry the eight. But this great conquering Knight did flourish long before: he was the sonne of Sir Thomas Fogge knight, buried at Glastenbury, by his wife the Countesse of Ioyeux in France.

These Nuns were endowed with the Church of Redingate with other reuenues, and were to pay twelue pence yearely to the Monkes of S. Augustine, vpon his feast day, on the high altar. The Monastery of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, commonly called, Saint Austins. Annis sexcentis preter tres Anglia mundi, Christi nascentis micuit Baptismatis vnda. The yeare of our redemption, sixe hundred and three (as these times do testifie) Ethelbert, king of Kent, receiued the lauer of Baptisme in Saint Martins Church, at the hands of Saint Augustine: within two yeares after that, he began the foundation of this Monasterie. As I haue it out of this his Charter, in the red booke of Canterbury. In nomine Domini nostri Iesu Christi. Omnem hominem, qui secundum Deum viuit, & remunerari à Deo sperat & optat, oportet, vt puris precibus consensum hilariter & ex animo prebeat.

Austin did also confirme and strengthen King Ethelberts donation by his owne Bull or charter, and exempted this Abbey from all Archiepisco∣pall iurisdiction, Abb . Aug. Mss. in lib. Co .

And en∣riched it with diuers reliques of Saints which hee had brought with him from Rome; amongst which was a part of Christs seamelesse Cote, and of Aarons Rod. And here by the way obserue, that Austin sealed his deeds or charters, bulla plumbea, Harsfeld Hist. Angl. Sex.

But this Abbey was endowed with ample reuenues by many others, so that being valued at the dissolution, like the rest of all such religious foun∣dations at a fauourable and farre vnder-rate, it amounted to bee yearely worth 1412. l. 4. s. 7 d. ob. q. It was surrendred 4. Decemb. 29. Hen. 8. Saint Austine replenished this house with blacke Monkes, Benedictines, and ordained it to be the place of Sepulture for the kings of Kent, for him∣selfe, and all succeeding Archbishops. The first king here interred, was the foresaid Ethelbert, who, after hee had gloriously raigned the space of 56. yeares, and had enlarged the frontiers of his Empire, as farre as the great Riuer Humber, entred into the eternall blisse of the kingdome on heauen. The yeare of our redemption 616. and in the 13 yeare after he had recei∣ued the Christian faith. As I finde it in this old Manuscript. Ethelbert cleped the hely king of Kent In the yer of grace six hundryd and sixtene Deide, and of Christendome the xxi y wene. Six and fifty Wynter he had regnyd her And aftur Edbald hys son regne gan ther. He was buried on the North side of the Church, vpon whose Monu∣ment this Epitaph was engrauen. Rex Ethelbertus hic clauditur in Polyandro, Fana pians certe Christo meat absque Meand . King Ethelbert lieth here closde in this Polyander, For building Churches sure he goes to Christ without Meander. Berta his wife was here likewise interred, who was the daughter of Chilperick, king of France, who was grandchilde to Clouis, the first Chri∣stian king of that famous nation; this woman was conuerted to Christia∣nity before she came out of her owne countrey, and before Austins arriuall here in England, Beda. lib. 25.26. and was married to king Ethelbert, with these conditions made by her parents. That it should be lawfull for her to keepe inuiolable the rites of her Religion, and enioy the presence and instructions of her learned Bishop Luitharde, whom they appointed to assist and helpe her in matters of her faith. She was a woman of vertuous and holy inclination, spending much of her time in prayer, almes-deeds, and other workes of charitie; frequenting daily her Oratorie, within Saint Martins, a Church built in former times by the beleeuing Romanes; wherein her reuerend as∣sistant Luitardus vsed also to instruct, and exhort the people to newnesse of life, and Religion: so that by her example, and his preaching, many of the Kentish Paynims were brought in, to beleeue the glad tydings of the Gospell. These proceedings with his wiues perswasions, wrought so effe∣ctually with good king Ethelbert, that his heart was softned, and his eares already opened to receiue and embrace the doctrine of S. Austine. Where∣upon some do gather, that the happinesse of his, and his Subiects conuer∣sion may as well be attributed to Berta, Wil. Malmes. de gestis Rev, lib. 1. ca. 1. Speed. Hist. and her French attendants, as to Austine and his fellow-disciples. Of which an old namelesse Rimer very ancient. Whan Ethilbert hadde regned bot a yer, Sent Awstyn hym to Cristen feyth conuert, Thrughe goddys grase, as clerly dyd apere, Who hadde to wyffe Berta, that was advert To Cristen feyth, in Fraunce afore convert; That helpt therto wyth all hur dylygens As Awstyn dyd wythe all benyvolens. She was likewise an earnest parswader, and a pertaker with her husband Ethelbert in and for the propagating and erecting of Religion, and religi∣ous structures; as I obserue out of the same Authour.

This blessed Queene died before her husband, neare vnto whom he desired to be buried, ann. 622. for whom this Distich was composed. Moribus ornata iacet hic Regina beata Berta, Deo grata fuit ac homini peramata. Edbald king of Kent. Here sometime lay the body of Edbald entombed, king of Kent, the sonne and heire of the before named Ethelbert, by his Queene Berta ; who began his raigne as wickedly as his father ended his worthily: for hee re∣fused to entertaine the doctrine of Christ, Beda li. 2. cap. 5. and polluted himselfe by the marriage of his mother in law, his owne fathers second wife: but at length being conuerted by Archbishop Lawrence, from his idolatrie, and incestu∣ous matrimonie, hee endeuoured by all meanes possible to propagate and maintaine the state of the Gospell. The king of Kent Edbald his furst wyf forsoke R b. Glocest. And held hym to hys Christendom yat he furst toke. And built a Chappell within this Monasterie, in honour of Mary the bles∣sed mother of God, endowing it with sufficient maintenance, wherein after the continuance of 24. yeares raigne, Emma the wif of K. Edbald hee was buried, ann. 640. His wife Emma the daughter of Theodebert, king of Lorraine was buryed by him. Ercombert kin of Kent, and Sexburgh his wife. Here lieth Ercombert the sonne of the said Edbald, king of Kent, a re∣ligious king; who suppressed all the Temples of the heathen Idols, and commanded the fast of Lent to be obserued. His wife Sexburgh, daughter of Anna king of the East Angles was layed by him; Beda. li. 2. cap. 8 This King hauing raigned foure and twentie yeares and odde monethes, finished his dayes, ann. 664. Egbert king of Kent. Egbert succeeded his father Ercombert ; and if the murther of his two co∣sin-Germans had not much blemished his peaceable gouernment, he might well haue holden place with the worthiest of the Kentish kings.

And so in like manner this Church was honoured with the sepulchres of Lothaire, Withred, Edelbert and other Kentish kings, and also with the shrines of many English Saints, whose sacred Reliques (as they were then esteemed) brought both great ve ration and bencht to this relig ou Structure. The first man of eminencie that I finde to haue b ene e shrined in this Abbey, was Saint Augustine, the first Archbishop of this See of Canterbu∣ry; a Romane borre, and a Monke of Saint Benets order, who, with others, was sent hither out of Italie, by Gregory the great, Pope of Rome, to preach the word of God to this our English nation; hee with his fellowes, to the number of fourty persons, landed in the Isle of Tenet within this County; where they were shortly after visited of king Ethelbert But the story is fre∣quent, and I shall be often touching vpon it by the way, and hi Legend is too long for my intended short discourse; therefore I hope the Reader will rest contented with this abbreuiation for both. Whils Ethelbert was reignyng kyng of Kent Sainct Austin sent by Gregory of R. bishop Landed in Tenet, with Clerkes of his assent, And many Monkes to teache the saith I hope, That clothed were vnder a blacke cope: Whiche in Procession, with crosses and Bells came, The Latinies syngyng in Iesus his name▪ In the yere of Chryst his incarnacion, Fiue hundreth fourescore and sixtene; King Ethelbert had in his dominacion Al Kent throughout, with greate ioy as was seen Were baptised then in holy water clene, To whome Gregory sent Mellito and Iusto With other Clerkes and Doctors many mo.

This man was of an exceeding tall stature, well fauoured, of a very ami∣able countenance, but of his learning, I finde little worthy of remembrance: sine doctrina sana docebat (saith one) ac sine perceptibili lingua ignotae prae∣dicabat genti. Bal . Centur. prima. He died the 26. of May, in the thirteenth yeare of his first entrance into England, and was buried first without doores, neare to the Church of this Monastery, because the Church was not finished: and af∣terwards his body was remoued into the North Porch of the said Church; in which place fiue of his Successours were likewise interred. Vpon the Tombe of this Austine this Epitaph was insculped in Latine: thus trans∣lated. Here resteth the body of Augustine, the first Archbishop of Canter∣bury, that was sent into this Land by Saint Gregory, Bishop of Rome, ap∣proued of God by working of miracles, and that brought Ethelbert the king and his people from the worshipping of Idols, vnto the faith of Christ; the dayes of whose office being ended in peace, he deceased, May 26. the said king Ethelbert yet raigning. But from the Porch his body was remoued into the Church, for in the yeare of our saluation 1221.5. Kalend. Maij. Iohn de Marisco ▪ then Prior of this Monastery, with the rest of his Couent, being desirous to know the place where the body of this Archbishop their patron, was deposited (af∣ter fasting and prayer) caused a wall to be broken neare to Saint Austins Altar, where they found a Tombe of stone, sealed and close sh t vp with on, and lead, hauing this Inscription. Inclitus Anglorum Presul pius, et decus altum; Hic Augustinus requiescit corpore sanctus. And in the yeare 1300.3. Kal. Augusti, Thomas Findon (then being Abbot) enshrined his reliques in a more sumptuous manner, adding ano∣ther Distich to the former, expressing his affectionate loue to the said Saint Austin his patron. Inclitus Anglorum Presul pius, & decus altum; Hic Augustinus requiescit corpore sanctus. Ad tumulum landis Patris almi ductus amore, Abbas hunc tumulum Thomas dictauit honore. But for the continuance of this mans memory, this Monastery it selfe (howsoeuer demolished) surpasseth all funerall Monuments, Inscriptions, or Epitaphs; for in regard he was the procurer of the building thereof, the names of Saint Peter and Paul are now (and were many hundred yeares since, quite forgotten) and the whole fabricke called onely S. Austins. Austin a little before his death, consecrated his companion Lawrence, Archbishop of this See, the next to succeed him in his gouernment, lest ei∣ther by his owne death (as Lambard obserues) or want of another fit man to fill the place, the chaire might happely bee carried to London, as Gregory the Pope had appointed. Of which consecration my foresaid Manuscript.

And like a true Pastour and Prelate, solicitously care , not nely the Church of the Englishmen, but also for the old inhabitants of , of Scotland, and Ireland, amongst whom the sparkles of Christianitie were alreadie kindled. The foundations of this Church being now well strongly layed, the maine thing that thwarted his religious designes▪ , that Edbald king of Kent, would not with all his godl exhorta ons ∣ing a vitious young man) be brought from his Paganisme, to beleeue in the onely euerliuing God. And that his people following the example o king, returned ikewise to the filthie vomit of their abhominable Idola e. Lawrence perceiuing at last, that neither his reprehensions nor faire words tooke any effect, but rather incited the King and the Subiect to a more des perate hatred of him, and of his Religion, determined to depart the king∣dome, to follow Bishop Iusto and ellite before banished, and to recom¦mend the charge of his flocke to God, the carefull Shepherd of all mens soules But the night before the day of his intended departure (saith Beda ) Saint Peter appeared vnto him in his sleepe, Beda li. 2. ca. 6 and reprehended him sharply, for purposing to runne away, and to leaue the sheepe of Iesus Christ, beset in the middest of so many Wolfes; hee challenged him with Apostolicall authoritie, argued with him a long while very vehemently, and, among all, scourged him naked so terriblie, as when he waked, finding it more then a dreame, all his body was gore bloud. Thus, well whipped, he went to the king, shewing him his stripes, and withall related vnto him the occasion of those so many fearefull lashes: which strucke such a terrour into the king, as by and by he renounced his Idolls, put away his incestuous wife, caused himselfe to be baptized. And for a further testimonie of his vnfained con∣uersion, built a Chappell in this Monasterie of Saint Peter. Of which I haue spoken before Of which more succinctly thus in my namelesse Manuscrip .

This Laurence writ a learned booke of the obseruation of Easter, and some exhorta iue Epistles to the Bishops and Abbots of the Scottish, Irish, and Brittish Churches; beseeching, and praying them to receiue and keepe the societie of Catholicke obseruation, with that Church of Christ which is spread ouer the whole world. He died the same yeare that Edbald be∣came Christian, Februar. 3. An. Dom. 619. and was buried in the Church Porch beside Augustine his predecessour. For whom this Epitaph was composed.

Mellitus, sometime an Abbot of Rome, succeeded Laurence in this grace, and Ecclesiasticall dignitie, Mellitus Arch∣bishop. sent hither by Saint Gregory, to assist Augustine in the seruice of the Lord, by whom he was first consecrated Bishop of Lon∣don; during his abode in that place, he conuerted vnto the faith of Christ, Sebert king of the East Saxons. Of which this Stanza: out of Harding. Peter the first Abbot of Saint Austin .

But the wicked sonnes of this good King Sebert expelled Mellitus out of their dominions; from whence he trauelled into France, and there stay∣ed for a time, Beda. li. 2 vntill he was commanded by Archbishop Laure ce to ret ne and looke to his flocke. He was a man noble by birth, but much more no∣ble for the excellencie of his minde; an eloquent speaker; and therefore a ∣siuely called of some, Mellifluous, exceeding carefull of his charge, despi∣sing the world, and neuer caring for any thing but heauen, and heauenly things: Godwin. de P l.

Summus Pontificum flos tertius et mel apricum; Hac titulis clara redoles Mellite sub arca. Laudibus eternis te predicat vrbs Dorouernis Cui simul ardenti restas virtute potenti. Presently vpon the death of Mellitus, Iustus Arch∣bishop. Iustus then Bishop of Rochester, was preferred to this Archbishopricke. He was a Romane borne, the disci∣ple of Gregory the great, by whom he was sent ouer into England, to preach the Gospell. Ha p feld Hist. Aug. ca. 7. He was a Monke after the order of Saint Benet: Vir tantae in∣tegritatis vi iusti nomine non tam gentilicio, quam propter virtatem hono∣randus censeretur. Which his vertue, as also his learning are both highly commended by Pope Boniface the fourth, Beda li. 2. ca 8. to whom, as to his deared belo∣ued Brother, he sendeth greeting. He died Nouemb. 10. ann. 634. was bu∣ried by his predecessour, Io. C ygraue. and canonized a Saint and Confessor. But heare his Epitaph. Istud habet bustum meritis cognomine Iustum Quarto iure datus cui cessit Pontificatus, Pro meritis Iusti sancta grauitate venusti: Gratia diuinam diuina dat his medicinam. Honorius a reuerend learned man, Honorius Arch∣bishop. borne in the same Citie, brought vp vnder the same Master, and one of the same order with Iustus, succeeded him in his pontificall Gouernment. During the time he sate, which was somewhat aboue twentie yeares, Beda. li. . ca 9. amongst other things, hee appointed di∣uers Bishops to diuers countries, and diuided his Prouince into Parishes, of which I haue spoken before, that so he might appoint particular Ministers or Priests, to particular congregations. In his time the Pelagian heresie be∣gan to spring vp againe in Scotland; but by his exhortatorie diuine Epistles to the Clergie of that kingdome, he so dealt, that the poysonous infection of that contagious heresie spread not farre, neither continued any long time. He died Februar. 28. Ann. 653. and was laid with his predecessours. This was his Epitaph. Quintus honor memori versu memoraris Honori Digna sepultura, quam non teret vlla Litura: Ardet in obscuro tua lux vibramine puro Hec scelus omne premit, fugat vmbras, nubila demit. One Frithona (famous for his learning and vertuous life) being elected Archbishop, Deus dedit Archbishop. vpon the day of his consecration changed his name, for Deus dedit, or Adeodatus. He was the first Englishman that gouerned this See: which charge he attended carefully the space of sixe yeares, and dyed Iuly 4. Ann. 664. being the very same day that Ercombert the king of Kent dyed; he was the last Bishop buried in the Church-porch. Such was his Epitaph.

Hee was excee dingly well learned, both in profane and holy literature: hee would often visit the countrey of the Englishmen all ouer, and teach them the waye and pathes of good life. Hee was the first Archbishop vnto whom all the whole Church of the English Nation did yeeld, and consent to submit themselues; Hee writ many learned bookes, mentioned by B e ; hee was the seuenth Archbishop, of whom these verses were written vpon the wall in Latine, now translated thus into English. Seuen Patriarchs of England, Primates seuen, Seuen Rectors, and seuen Seuen starres in Charles waine.

These verses were common to a l these seuen pillars of the English Church, for so they are called; yet euery one, as you haue read, had his par∣ticular Epitaph, and this following went curiant for Theodore, thus Eng∣lished by the Translatour of venerable Bede.

Brithwald (called like others allusiuely Bright world) Abbot of Recul∣uer, some two yeares after the decease of Theodore, was elected and conse∣crated Archbishop, by one Godwin, Metropolitan of France. He was a man very well learned, both in Diuinitie and humanitie, and very skilfull both in Ecclesiasticall and Monasticall orders, censures, and disciplines, but farre inferiour in all vnto his predecessour He continued Archbishop in this f med, seuen and thirtie yeares, sixe moneths, fourteene dayes: a longer time then euer any did either before or since; and dyed Ianuar. 9. ann 731. and was buried in this Abbey Church: because the Porch was already filled with the dead bodies of his predecessours: for whom this Epitaph was , and engrauen vpon his Monument. Stat sua laus feretro Brithwaldus stat sua metro Sed minor est metri laus omnis laude feretri. Laude frequentandus, pater hic & glorificandus; Si pr ce slectatur, dat ei qui danda precatur. Tatwin a man very religious, and no lesse learned, succeeded Brithwald ; soone after whose consecration, great controuersie arose betweene him and the Archbishop of Yorke, about the Primacie: wherein Tatwin preuailed. Who hauing sate onely three yeares, died Iuly the last day, An. Dom. 735. and was buried here in the Church by his predecessour. To whose memory this Epitaph was cut vpon the stone coffin. Pontificis glebe Ta wini Cantia prebe Thura, decus, laudes, & cuius dogmate gandes▪ Hu us doctrina carnisti men e ferina; Et per cu Christi pe tare iugum dedicis i▪ Here sometime lay interred the body of Nothelme, Archbishop, who for that he well and wisely gouerned his See, was called, Noble helme. was borne in London; and was one of the Priests of Saint Pauls, a great louer of venerable antiquitie he was, and one to whom Bede acknowledg th himselfe to be much beholding for diuers matters; which, vpon his port, he inserted into his Ecclesiasticall History. He died October 17. An. 74 . His Epitaph was after this manner. Hac scrobe Nothelmus iacet Archiepiscopus almus. Cuius vita bono non est indigna patrono. Cunctis iste bonus par in bonitate Patronus Protegit hic iustos vigili munimine Custos. Cutbert Archbishop of Canterbury, not long before this time had pro∣cured of king Eadbert, that the bodies of all the Archbishops which were to succeed, should not bee buried at Saint Augustines, as they had beene heretofore, but at Christ-Church; and so, according to his desire, the u∣neralls of himselfe, and his successour Bregwin, were there solemnised, and their bodies therein interred. The Monkes of Saint Austins tooke the mat∣ter hainously, to haue the buriall of their Archbishops discontinued, and began to make complaint vnto the Pope. But Christ-Church men were so farre from fearing the Pope (for the same Pope had confirmed their priui¦ledges but a little before at the sute of Bregwin ) that they chose one Lam∣bert, or Iainbert, Abbot of Saint Augustines for their Archbishop: assuring themselues he would be now as earnest a defender of their liberties, as here∣tofore he had beene an oppugner in the behalfe of Saint Augustines. But they found it otherwise, for perceiuing his end to approach, he tooke or∣der to be buried in S nt , but he was the last of all the Arch∣bishops there in Archbishop 7. yeares, and liued ninetie foure: his funeralls were pompe and celebritie, and his body honourablie entombed here in Chapter-house. Vpon which this Epitaph was engrauen. Gemma Sacerdotum remotum, Clauditur hac fossa & ssa. Sub hac molecinis, inis Incola nunc celi populo ideli. I finde some Epitaphs to the memory of sundrie Abbots of this Mona∣stery; and first, Peter the first Abbot of S. Austins. of the first Abbot, one Peter a Priest, who was chosen to this place by Saint Augustine, as I haue said before. This man was sent Le∣gat into France, by king Ethelbert, and in his returne for England, was drowned in a Crecke, . 1. ca. 33. called Amflete; his body was taken vp, and buried after a homely manner of the inhabitants of that countrey; yet afterwards remoued from thence, and honourably interred in the Tow e of Bulley e. in a place of Saint Maries Church conuenient for so worthy a person. For whom a Monument was erected within this Abbey, bearing this In∣scription▪ Lib. 5. Aug. in bi Cot. Gul el Spina. Quem notat hunc metrum meritis & nomine Petrum Abbas egregius primus Laris extitit huius. Dum semel hic transit mare ventus in vrbe remansit Bolonia celebris virtutibus est i i crebris. He was drowned about the yeare, 614. My old Anonimall Manuscrip speakes of this first Abbot to the like effect. Than Austyn mad Peter the cheffe Prelat Of an Abbey, now callyd seynt Aus yns In Canterbery, of whiche denominat He was Abbot, as sent Bede dyffyns, Who aftar as he to Fraunce was sent fro thens On embassyat, was drownyd on the se, And beryed at Boleyne wyth solempnite.

Iohn e se∣cond Abbot Iohn a monke of this house, and the third man of note which came ouer with Austin, was elected Abbot of this house, and receiued benediction at the hands of Archbishop Laurence. He died, Ann. 618. and was buried here in our Ladies Chappell, and this was his Epitaph. Omnibus est annis pietas recitanda Iohannis Culmine celsa nimis p tribusque simillima primis. Vir probus & mitis fu hic si fare velitis Integer & mundus sap ens Abbasque secundus. Ruffinian was here interred by his predecessour Iohn, Ruffinian the third. who dyed, Ann. 626. Pausa patris sani patet istec Ruffiniani Abbatis terni, quo frenditur hostis Auerni. Gratiosus succeeded Ruffinian in his holy gouernment: Gratiosus the fourth. a man gracious, saith mine Author, with God and all good men. And so ended his world∣ly pilgrimage, Ann. 640. Hic Abbas quartus Gratiosus contulit artus, Cuius adest pausa miti spiramine clausa. Petronius was sacred to this Ecclesiasticall dignitie by Archbishop Ho¦norius, Petronius the fifth. Ann. 640. and died Ann. 654. Abbas Petronius bonitatis odore refertus. Subiectos docuit, vitiorum sorde pianit. Nathaniel vir probitate decoratus, Nathaniel t e sixth. and absolute in all perfections, was consecrated Abbot here in his owne Church, by Archbishop Deus-dedit, which he laudably gouerned thirteene yeares, and died, Ann. 667. Spiritus in celis Abbatis Nathanielis, Nos faciat memores Patres memorare v litis. Adrian borne in Africa; Adrian the seuenth. Abbot first of the Monastery of Niridia, neare vnto Naples: a man wondrous well learned in the holy Scriptures, through∣ly instructed both in Monasticall discipline, and Ecclesiasticall gouernment; very skilfull of the Greeke and Latine tongues, and withall very expert in the liberall Sciences of Astronomie, and Musicke: who, together with heodore, Singing first vsed in English Christian Churches. Bed. lib. 4. cap. 2. brought first of all in, the tunes and notes of singing in the Church, which for a little time was onely vsed and knowne here in Kent, but afterwards learned and practised through all the Churches of Eng∣land, by the meanes of reuerend Bishop Wilfride, who brought from Kent Iames and Stephen, two Musitians, the first Masters of song in the Churches of the kingdome of Northumberland. But to descend to more particulars. The Archbishopricke of Canterbury was offered to this Adrian, by Vit ll ∣am the Pope (that excellent Musitian, pageant of Popes. who wrote the Ecclesiasticall Canon, and first brought singing and Organs into the Church) which hee refused to vndertake, preferring a Monke of his acquaintance, namely, Theodore, (spoken of before) to the same place, in whose companie hee trauelled into England, and had the companie and helpe of this Adrian, in all things hee went about to effect within England. Hee was consecrated Abbot of this Monastery by the said Theodore, in the gouernment of which, he continued nine and thirtie yeares. In which time hee obtained many priuiledges of Theodatus the Pope for his Abbey, as also of Oswin king of the Deirians. He dyed honae memoriae senex, a reuerend old man of good and perfect re∣membrance, ann. 708. and was honourablie entombed here in our Ladies Chappell, with this Epitaph. Qui legis has apices, Adriani pignora, dices Hoc sita sarcophago sua nostro gloria pago. Hic decus Abbatum, patrie lux, vir probitatum Subuenit à celo si corde rogetur anhelo. These seuen Abbots (aboue mentioned) were all outlandish men, sent hither either at the first to accompanie Augustine, or afterwards Mellitus and Iustus in their iourney from Rome. Albinus the eighth. Albinus the Scholler of Adrian, and Abbot of this house, was here in∣terred, who as he followed his Master in his office, so did he in all his good and godly wayes. And so died in the 24. yeare of his Abbotship, 732. and was buried by his Master. Laus Patris Albini non est obnoxia fini Gloria debetur sibi quam sita vitae meretur. Multa quippe bonos faciens virtute patronos Abbas efficitur bonus hic et honore petitur. Nothbald the ninth. Shortly after the decease of Albin, one Nothbaldus a Monke of this fra∣ternitie was chosen Abbot: in which office hee continued about sixteene yeares, died ann. 748. and was buried neare his predecessours. Nothbaldi mores rutilant inter Seniores, Cuius erat vita subiectis norma polita. Aldhume the tenth. Aldhumus was the next Abbot, in the time of whose gouernment the buriall of the Archbishops was taken away from the Church of this Mo∣nasterie, by the cunning sleight and ouerswaying authoritie of Archbishop Cuthbert, as I haue partly touched: but howsoeuer, his holy brethren of this Couent did impute all the fault vnto the supine negligence of their Ab∣bot, in that he did not more carefully defend this their common cause. Whereupon after his death, which happened, ann: 760. some 12. yeares, they fastened this Epitaph vpon a pillar neare to the place of his buriall; bewraying the viperous malice of this Monkish broode to him their de∣ceased father. Fert memor Abbatis Aldhumi nil probitatis, Pontificum Pausani cassat tutans male causam, Prisca premens iura dum Cuthbertus tumulatur. Fulta sepultura sanctis per eum reprobatur . Lambert the eleuenth. About a yeare Lambert or Ianibert (before remembred) was Abbot of this house, afterwards Archbishop. He procured six plough lands of ground to this Abbey, of king Edbert, in little Mongham. Ethelnothes, Guttardus, Cunred neare of kinne to Nenulph the Mercian king. Cunred and Wernod procu∣red 40. plough lands of groūd of the kings of Mercia and Kent to their Monasterie. Vt in charta Cunredus; Wernodus, cosin to Offa and Cuth∣red kings of Mercia and Kent, of whom this Wernode obtained many rich gifts for this his Monasterie: Diernodus, Wintherus, Readmundus, Kimbert, Eta, Degmund, Alfred, Ceolbert, Bectane, Athelwold, Vlbert, Eadred, Alch∣mund, Sittulfe, Cadred, Luling, Beorline, Alfricke, who by his familiarity with king Edmund, obtained two plough-land to his Monasterie. Elsnoth, Siricius who was first a Monke in Glastonbury, then Abbot of this Mona∣stery, from hence preferred to the Bishopricke of Wiltshire, and thence re∣moued to this Primatship of Canterbury. A man much blamed in our an∣cient Histories, for perswading with his countreymen to buy their peace with the Danes (who had inuaded Kent and ss x) with the price of six¦teene thousand pounds. Wulfrike Elmer, a man of great holinesse, from hence aduanced to the Bishopricke of Sherborne, and after some yeares (falling blinde) gaue ouer that gouernment returned to this Abbey, where¦in all the rest of his dayes he led a priuate life. Elstan first Prior of the house, whom king Knute would haue preferred to the Bishopricke of W n∣chester, which hee denyed, neither would hee haue taken this, but by the importunate sute of his brethren. These Abbots (aboue named) some twenty eight in number, succeeded one another, of whom albeit we may beleeue that many memorable and good actions were performed: yet time, which weareth all things out of re∣membrance, hath left little of them remarkable to this age. Wulfrike the second succeeded Elstan, Vir probi consilij, and often em∣ployed vpon Embasies to the Pope. He translated the body of Saint Mil∣dred into another place of the Church: hee dyed suddenly, ann. 1059. by the iust iudgement of God (saith the story) because he neglected the beau∣tifying of our Ladies Chappell, being thereto commanded by S. Dunstan who had conference in a vision with the blessed Virgin concerning that matter. Vpon the death of Wulfrike, one Egelfine succeeded, and receiued bene∣diction from Archbishop Stigand, about the yeare 1063. he was sent about I know not what Embasie to Pope Alexander the second, to whom the Pope gaue this honour, That it should bee lawfull for him and his succes∣sours to vse the Mytre and Apostolike Sandall. But presently vpon his re∣turne home, he fled ouer Seas into Denmarke, for feare of William the new Conquerour. And being no sooner thus gone (without licence first obtain∣ed) his goods were confiscate to the King: and one Scotland, by birth a Norman, inuested in his place. This Abbot receiued many gracious fauours from the Conquerour. He recouered much land vniustly taken from his Monasterie, with diuers im∣munities. He was a great cause for the confirmation of the ancient Franchi∣ses and liberties of Kent; he built a great part of his Church anew, and re∣moued the bones of Adrian, and other Abbots, with the bodies of foure Kentish kings, being but obscurely buried, and entombed them in the Quire of the Church vnder princely Monuments; hee dyed the third day of September, ann. 1087. and was buried in a vault vnder the Quire in S. Maries Chappell. Abbas Scotlandus prudentibus est memorandus ......libertatis...... dare gratis Actu magnificus, generosa stirpe creatus Viribus enituit sanctis sancte quoque vixit. One Wido was the next Abbot, Wido the 42. who repaired the Tombe or Shrine of Saint Augustine: he dyed August 13. ann. 1091. and was buried in a vault vnder S. Richards Altar. Whose tombe-stone was thus inscribed. Hunc statuit poni tumulum mors atra Widoni Cui stans sede throni superi det gaudia doni. Hugh de Flori 4 . One Hugh de Flori, or Floriaco, a Norman borne, neare a kinne to the Conquerour, vnder whom and his sonne William Rufus (being a strenuous and an expert Souldier) hee had serued in the warres both of Normandie and England, Guliel. Spina in bib. Cot. who comming with William Rufus vpon a time to visit Saint Austines Shryne, would needs be made a Brother of this Fraternitie; which being granted, he sold forthwith all his lands in Normandie (hauing nei∣ther wife nor childe) and tooke vpon him the Monasticall habite: This Hugh had scarce continued one yeare of probation, when as the foresaid Abbot Wido departed the world; vpon whose death the Monkes of Saint Austines comming to William Rufus to obtaine licence to elect a new Ab∣bot, the king swore by Lukes face that he would haue no election at all, for he intended to take all the spirituall liuings of England into his owne hands; Well, for this time they went away with each one a flea in his eare, yet afterwards it was decreed, that two circumspect graue Monkes, toge∣ther with this Hugh de Flori, should be sent to the king to procure his fa∣uour for an election, either by petition, or price; when these presented themselues vnto his sight, and that he saw his cosin, who before had serued him in the brauerie of a Souldier, to bee now clothed in the habite of a Monke; he was so dismayed in minde, that gushing out with teares, hee said, I do grant you this Cosin of mine to be your Abbot, and at your peti∣tion I do giue him the gouernment of the Abbey of Saint Augustine, nei∣ther do I permit you to choose any other, whom, vnlesse you do presently receiue, I will shortly burne your Abbey to ashes. Then the Monkes seeing no remedie, submitted themselues to the kings will in the premises. But the foresaid Hugh refused the dignitie, saying, That he was a man in a man∣ner vnlettered, and one that had very little skill, as well in religion, as in Ecclesiasticall ordinances; yet the king and the Monkes enforced him to accept of the honour offered, neither would the king suffer him to depart from the Court, before he was consecrated Abbot, which was solemnized in the kings Chappell at Westminster, by Mauricius Bishop of London. I haue beene somewhat long in this narration, yet, I hope, nothing at all troublesome, or tediously impertinent. This illustrious Abbot did many laudable acts to the great commoditie of his Church; and distributed all his goods in workes of charitie. He dyed full of yeares as of goodnesse, the 26. of March, ann. 1120. and was buried on the North side of the Chapter-house built by himselfe from the foundation: for whom this honourable re∣membrance was engrauen. Abbas Eheu Floris specimen virtutis, honoris, Hic iacet in tumulo, Presul peramabilis Hugo. Floruit vt terris, Pater hic, pace & quoque guerris; Floret nunc celo Christi pugil iste sereno. Hugh the se∣cond 44. The next Abbot in succession was one Hugh de Trottescline Chaplaine to King Henry the first, at the time of whose election, great dissention, for small trifles, being betwixt the Monkes of Christ-Church, and those of this Monastery, William then Archbishop taking part with those angrie Votaries of his owne house, denyed Abbot Hugh enedict on which was glad to obtaine from Seffria the first, Bishop of . This man brought in againe the old number of his Monkes, which were threescore profest, beside the Abbot. He founded an Hospitall neare to his owne Ab∣bey, which he dedicated to the honour of and Saint to the maintenance whereof he giue ne Acres of ground, vpon which Hospitall was to be erected, and all the the of the Lordship of in this County, with other possessions, at the 7. s. 10. d. of yearely reuenue. This Hosp tall was ordained and appointed especially for this if it should so happen that any protest Monke of this Monastery, infected with any contagious disease, but aboue a with the reason of which sicknesse, or infectious maladie, he could not the precincts of the Abbey, without preiud c and scandall to the er tie, that then he should be prouided for in this Hospitall of a conue n ent ch mber, of meate, drinke, and apparell, in as full a measure as any one of his Br thr n liuing in the Monastery. A so, if it should so happen, that the father, the mother, the sister, or brother, of a y Monke of this Monastery, hou d come to such great want and nd gencie as that (to the reproach of any of these r thren) he, or she▪ be forced to aske at the gates, the almes of the Fraternitie, that th such of them so asking, should be prouided for in this Hospit ll, of sufficient stentation, according to the abilitie of the house, by the aduise and consi∣deration of the Abbot of Saint Austins, and the Master of this Hospitall, for the time being, as further appeares by his Charter, confirmed by many of his Successours. This charitable Abbot dyed the yeare 1151. and was buried in the Chapter house by his Predecessour. Siluester, the Prior of this Monastery, being elected Abbot vpon the de∣cease of Hugh, was denyed Benediction of Archbishop heobald, obi t∣ing against him, that he was a man defamed with many notorious offences but clearing himselfe before the Pope (by what m es or money I know n t) of all those enormous imputations laid to his charge, vpon the sight of the Popes letters, the Archbishop durst not but giue him admi ta This Siluester instituted, that euery yeare during the time of Lent, so many poore people should be prouided for of meate and drinke sufficient, at and the charges of the Abbey, as there were Monkes in the Couent. dyed ann 1161. and was buryed by his predecessour. One Clarembaldus (a lay man I thinke, for he neuer wore other then a secular habite) by the kings regall authoritie, d d now irregularly intrude vpon the possessions, goods, and gouernment of this Abbey, which by maine violence he extorted, and misapplyed for the space of 15. yeares, vn∣till he was elected: and one Roger a Monke of Saint Trinitie, and keeper of an Altar in Christ-Church, was elected to his place. This Roger within a short time came greatly into the kings fauour, who restored vnto him all the lands and possessions which Clarembalde had wickedly wrested from his Monastery. He was consecrated by Pope Alex∣ander the third in his owne person at Tusculane, neare to Rome; to whom and to his Church, the said Pope restored the vse of the Mytre, Sandalls, and crosier, which had beene neglected euer since the flight of Abbot Egel∣fine, (who first obtained that honour) into Denmarke. This man indured many miseries the most part of his life-time, (which was very long) espe∣cially in the troublesome raigne of king Iohn. And so to conclude with the words of mine Authour. Will. Thorne, or Gul. Spina, in bib. Cott. Anno Domini 1212. obijt Sen x, & plenus die∣rum, qui diebus suis pro viribus multa adversae sustinuit, sed omnia Deo coo∣perante illesa custodiuit; & in capitulo sub lapide albo sepelitur.

Roger being dead, one Alexander a Monke of this Monastery, and a most excellent Diuine, Alexander sur∣named Cemen∣tari Theologus the 48. was elected Abbot, a man both in secular and Ec∣clesiasticall affaires well experienced, and of king Iohn singularly beloued, yet for all his good parts and great friends, Archbishop Langton absolute ly denyed him Benediction: for it was in that time when the king and the Bishop were at sore variance; so that he was constrayned to trauell to Rome, where he receiued consecration at the hands of Pope Innocent the third. Obijt Abbas iste Deo dilectus nocte, viz. Dominica 4. Non. Octob. An. 1220 This Abbot was, Vir corpore elegantissimus, facie venerabilis, & litera∣rum plenitudine imbutus. And for taking part with his Soueraigne: à sum∣mo honore in summam confusionem viliter praecipitatus erat, saith Mat. Westminst. ad An. 1209. Hugh the third the 49. Abbot. By the generall consent of the whole Couent, one Hugh, Chamberlaine of this house, was elected, sworne, and blessed by the Popes Legate at Win∣chester, before the king and many of the Peeres of the kingdome. This Abbot was religious, honest, prouident, and with learning, and a godly life life greatly adorned; and so departed from all worldly employment, the third day of Nouember, 1224. and was buried by the Altar of the holy Crosse vnder a flat marble stone, thus engrauen. Prosuit in populo Domini venerabilis Hugo, Et tribuit sancte subiectis dogmata vite. Robert de Bell the 50. A prouident and discreete Brother of this house succeeded Hugh in the Abbotship, to whom in like manner as hee did to Alexander, the Arch∣bishop vtterly denyed benediction, and admittance; for which he was en∣forced to trauell to Rome, and there was sacred by the hands of Patrick Bi∣shop of Albania, and Cardinall, by the Popes commandement. This Ab∣bots name was Robert de Bello, & belle rexit, for the space of eleuen yeares. Et obijt crastino sancti Mauri Abbatis, ann. 1252. His Epitaph.

Roger of Cicester by way of comprimise succeeded Robert, for whose ad∣mittance, or holy blessing, Pope Innocent the fourth writ his powerfull letters to Boni ▪ then Archbishop of Canter ur ; but what tooke I do not finde. He founded the Church or Chappell of in this Countie, and sumptuously sh yned the reliques of Saint He dyed on Saint day, 1272. and was buried before S.

The next that enioyed this dignitie was, Nicholas de Spina, he was con secrated at Rome by the Bishop of Portua, by the commandement of Pope Nicholas the third, of whom hee was approued to be, Virum prudentem, us et doctrina multipliciter decoratum, in temporalibus et spiritualibus Who when hee had with great wisedome gouerned his the s a e of ten yeares, hee tooke his iourney, by the kings permis∣sion to the Pope, before whom he resigned his Abbotship to one Thomas Fi on. Findon succeeding by way of resignation; bad benediction by the Popes appointment at Ciutta Vecchia, Thomas Findon not farre from Rome: he performed worthy actions for the good of his Church, and was euer ready with , and armour, for the seruice of the king: With great care and cost the reliques of Saint Austine, as I haue said before: had strenu usl gouerned his Church the space of 26. yeares, eternitatis vocatus erat die sancte Iuliane virginis, ann. 13 9. and was buried in a little Chappell (wherein vsually euery day a Masse was for the whole Estate of the Church militant vpon earth) vnder a mar∣ble stone inla d with brasse after the manner of a Bishop.

After the death of Findon, one of this Fraternitie, called Raph de Borne, Raph de Borne the 54. was elected. Who presently vpon his election, tooke his iourney to Avi∣ the Popes Court, where he was confirmed and consecrated by the Bi∣shop of Ho tia. Hauing laudablie gouerned this house 25. yeares, he dyed a venerable old man, ann. 1334. and was here honourably entombed in the North-wall. Pervigil in populo morum probitate decorus Abbas hoc tumulo de Borne iacet ecce Radulphus, Mille trecentenis triginta quater quoque plenis In Februi Mense celo petebat inesse.

Zelatorum morum, et etatis grauitate decorum, scientia preditum, in spiritu∣alibus prouidum, et in temporalibus circumspectum. Thomas Poucyn the 55. In the same yeare, the first of March, Thomas Poucyn, Doctor of Diui∣nitie, was chosen Abbot of this Monasterie; he tooke his iourney for bene∣diction, to the Popes Court, which then lay at Auinion in France, the nine and twentieth of the same moneth of March, whither hee came vpon Saint George his Eue following: hee had his admittance and blessing at the hands of Pope Iohn the two and twentieth, the day after the feast of Saint Barnabie ; he stayed at Auinion vntill the feast of S. Lawrence, from whence taking his iourney for England, he landed at Douer vpon S. Gregories day. Now if any man of his coat, dignitie, and reuenue, be desirous to know the expences of a iourney to Auinion, here he may haue it, taken out of the red booke of Canterbury, In bib.

About some nine yeares after this trauell, he made an end of all his trauels by death, on the day of the translation of Saint Augustine, ann. 1343. being all his time a carefull Shepherd ouer the flocke committed to his charge: he was entombed by his predecessour. Est Abbas Thomas tumulo presente reclusus, Qui vite tempus sanctos expendit in vsus. Illustris senior, cui mundi gloria vilis. L.V. à primo pastor suit huius o ilis. William Drulege the 6. The next that succeeded Poucyn, was one William Drulege, a man of stature, like little Zacheus, but of a minde immense and vigorous; or like Homers noble little Captaine Tydeus, corpore paruus ingenio pugnax. Maior in exiguo regnabat corpore virtus. For to enlarge the reuenues of his Church, he was euer wondrous solici∣tous, and in defence of her liberties stout and magnanimous: persisting still as deuoute and watchfull in his Ecclesiasticall contemplations, as hee was wise and circumspect in his temporall employments. Non quarendus quan∣tus sit quisque seà qualis, neque quam procerus sed quam probus: A little man is as much a man as the greatest man of the Gard. But I may bee thought quickly to speake somewhat partially, being none of these high puissant pikemen: enough then of little men, if not a little too much. So to returne to this diminutiue Abbot Drulege, who by the consent of the Couent, or∣dained the feasts of Ianibert, Nothelm, Brithwold, and Tatwin, Archbishops, to be celebrated twice in the yeare; But to conclude, when for the short time he sate, he had much aduanced his Monasterie, he dyed on the Vigils of Saint Mauritius, which is the 11. of September, 1349. and was buried in the Chapter house, with this Epitaph vpon his Monument. En paruus Abbas hic parua clauditur arca, In gestis magnus, maior nec erat Patriarcha. Willelmus Druleg illustri dignus honore, Conuentum claustri qui multo rexit amore. Pro dilectoris anima tui dulciter ora Sancti Augustini conuentus, qualibet hora. I finde little, or indeed nothing at all, of such Abbots as succeeded little Drulege, sauing their names thus recorded. Iohn Deueniche the 57. Thomas Colwell 58. Michaell Peckham 59.

So that by this account there hath beene more Archbishops of Christ-Church, M re Archbi∣shop, then Abbots by three. then Abbots of Saint Austins by the number of three, reckoning those sixe Bishops which haue beene since the dissolution: The Abbot of this house was euer a Baron of the Parliament. In S. Anns Chappell within the Church of this Monastery, Iulian Coun∣ e e of H n∣tington. lay sometime buried the body of Iulian the daughter and heire of Sir Thomas L yborne, knight. The widow, saith Vincent, of Iohn Lord Hastings of Aburgaueny, and mother of Lawrence Hasting, Catal. in Hun∣ting. Earle of Pembroke▪ and after that, wife of William de Clinton, Earle of Huntington, and Lord high Admirall of England, who dyed about the yeare 1350. But of all these and thousands more here interred (whose names I cannot learne) not one bone at this time lies neare another, nor one stone almost of the whole fabricke stands vpon another: therefore I will take my leaue of this Abbey with these words of a late writer: Io. Spe d. . This Monasterie (saith he) as all the rest did, came to her fatall period in the dayes of king Henry the eight, whose vncouered walls stood so long languishing in time, and stormes of weather, that daily increased the aspect of her ruines, till now lastly, they are made subiect to other publicke vses, and the whole tract of that most goodly foundation in the same place no where appearing. Onely Ethelberts Tower in memorie and honour of the man, as yet hath escaped the verdict and sentence of destruction; whose beauty, though much de faced and ouerworne, will witnesse to succeeding ages the magnificence of the whole, when all stood compleate in their glory together.

In which house was reserued the vpper leather of an old shoe, Lamb. peram in Harbaldowne. which had beene worne (as they gaue it out) by Saint Thomas Becket: this shoe, as a sacred Relique, was of∣fered to all passengers to kisse; faire set in copper, and christall. Hackington, commonly called S. Stephens, by Cant. Lora Countesse Leic ster. Catal. This Church in former times was honoured with the sepulture of Lo∣ra, or Lor atta, Countesse of Leicester, daughter of William Lord Brews of Brember in Suffex, and wife of Robert de Be lemont, surnamed Fitz∣p rnell, Earle of Leicester, and Lord high Steward of England; a most ho∣nourable Lady, Ca den in Kent. who hauing abandoned all worldly pleasures, sequestred her selfe wholly from the world, to serue God deuoutly in this place: who dyed about the yeare 1219.

Sir Christopher Hales, and Sir Roger Manwood, lie here fairely entom ed, of whom hereafter according to my method. Sir Roger Man∣woods Almes-house. But I must not let passe seuen almes houses here built by the said Sir Roger Manwood, chiefe Baron of the Exchequer, ann. 1573. for aged honest poore folkes, which he endow∣ed with a yearely allowance of foure pounds, in money, bread, and fewell, for euery one of those almes-men. It was called S. Stephens, f r that the image of Saint Stephen (standing where the garden now is, A pilgrimage S. Stephens . belonging to Sir Manwoods great house) was sought vnto by many pilgrimes. Reculuer. At the vpper end of the South isle in this Church, I saw a Monument of an antique forme, mounted with two spires. Wherein (as the Inhabi∣tants haue it by tradition) the body of one Ethelbert, Ethelbert the second king of nt. a Saxon king, who had his pallace royall here in Reculuer, lieth entombed, and the Anuals of Canterbury affirme as much: And true it is that Ethelbert the first, and first Christian king, built here a Princely mansion for himselfe and his succes∣sours; wherein diuers of the Kentish kings sometimes kept their courtly residence. But whether he be this Ethelbert the second, or Ethelbert surna∣med Pren, that lieth here interred, it is not much materiall, for they both dyed without any memorable act, either of themselues, or their kingdomes affaires: The end of the Kentish king∣dome. and so dyed Cuthred and Baldred their next successours, and the last kings of Kent. Which kingdome erected by Hengist, the yeare of mans happinesse 455. continued her gouernment 372. and ended her glory in the yeare 827. being made a Prouince to the West-saxons.

Here in this Church lyeth a Lady entombed in a Monument vpreared after a strange fashion, dila Lady Thorne. inscribed with a Saxon-like character. Ici gist Edile de Shornerepust Dame del espire. I thinke her name was rather Thorne, then Shorne, one letter being mistaken for another in the engrauing. My reason is this, for that in this Parish there is a place called Thorne. Neare vnto this Monument lie three flat Tombe-stones, vnder which (as I coniecture) by the effigies vpon them) three vailed Nunnes of the Saxon Nobilitie, Thr e vailed Nunnes and of S. Mildreds Monasterie lye interred, but the In∣scriptions are gone. Which Monasterie was founded vpon this occasion: Egbert king of Kent aspiring to the Crowne, The foundati¦on of Minster Abbey. by the traiterous murder of his two young Nephewes, Ethelred and Ethelbert, to pacifie Domneua, sister to the said murdered Princes, and immediate heire to the kingdome, promised with an oath to giue her whatsoeuer shee would demand. This deuoute Lady begged so much ground to build a religious house vpon, Io. Ca graue in v. a Dom. as a tame De re which she kept, would runne ouer at a breath: one Thunnor, or Thymur (one of his councell, and his assistant in the foresaid murder) standing by, blamed him of inconsideration, for that hee would vpon the vncertaine course of a Deere, depart to his certaine losse, with any part of so good a Soile. Which words he had no sooner spoken (saith the booke of Saint Au∣gustine ) but that the earth immediately opened and swallowed him vp. Well, the King and the Lady proceeded in their bargaine, and the Hynde ranne ouer fourty and eight Plough lands, before she returned. This do nation the king confirmed by his Charters, Mss a bib. Cot which I haue read in the booke of S. Austins, to the infringers whereof he added this fearefull curse. Si cui vero hec largicio displicet, vel si quis (quod absit) hanc donationem telo ductus Diaboli, A Maledicton. quoquo ingenio infringere temptauerit, Iram Dei & om∣nium Sanctorum maledicta incurrat, et subita morte intereat, sicut predictus Deo odibilis Thimur interijt, percutiatque cum Deus amentia, cecitate, ac fu∣rore m ntis, omnique tempore columpnam maledictionis Dei sustineat, non sit qui eum liberet, nisi penitus resipiscit & digna satisfactione satisfaciat.

Cultor siue sator huius mete violator Cum Thunor atra metit inde Barathra petit. Hauing erected her Monasterie, which she dedicated to the blessed Virgine Mary, The death of Domneua. and to the name and honour of her two murdered Brethren, in which he placed seuentie veyled Nunnes: She departed out of this world about the yeare of our redemption, 765. and was buried in the Church of her owne foundation. It is said by some, that when Thunnor had giuen his wicked command to king Egbert, The buriall of Thunnor. Dom. his horse present y a curuetin ▪ cast him off his backe, and broke his necke: and that be , buried in the Isle of Tenet, vnder a great heape of stones, which the inhabitan , to this day call Thunniclan. . Mildred. Mildred the daughter of Dom a, and M rwald, a Prince of West-Mercia, succeeded in her mothers pl ▪ n which shee continued a long time: dyed in the raigne of King , was interred by her mother, and afterwards canonized a Saint the Mercian king, confirmed by his charter to this Mildred and her Couent, the custome of the ships which arriued in the publicke Port of London, as appeares by his charter. Ca utus king of England, gaue by his Charter the body of this Mildred, with the lands belonging to this Priory, to the Abbey of S. Austins, in these words. Notum sit omnibus, &c. me dedisse Augustino, & fratribus eiusdem Mo∣nasterij, corpus beate Mildrede gloriose Virginis; cum t ta terra sua infra in sulam ac I anet, & extra, cum omnibus cons etudinibus suis. on of Mildred. The yeare 10▪0 her body was translated by Abbot Elstan, as I haue said before, and after that by his Successour Wulfrike, to another place of the Church. Her reliques were laid in a leaden coffin, whereupon this Epi∣taph was insculped. Clauditur hoc saxo Mildreda sacerrima virgo. Cuius nos procibus adiuuet ipse Deus. The bodies of the most esteemed godly in former ages, tooke the least rest in their graues, for they were still remoued, and their bodies clattered toge∣ther from one place to another; as it doth, and will appeare, both by the premisses and sequele of this my Treatise. You haue read before how often the body of Saint Augustine was tost from porch to pillar, and besides his Reliques were diuided, and subdiuided into certaine vessels. For the day after the solemnitie of Prior Marisco (before remembred) vpon the find∣ing out of his Stone-coffin, there was found, vnlooked for, a Lead of seuen foot long, hauing this Inscription. Hic habetur pars ossium & cineris beati Augustini Anglorum Apostoli, qui olim missus à beato Gregorio, gentem Anglicam ad fidem Christi conuertit, cuius preciosum capud, & ossa maiora, Guido Abbas honorifice transtulit, si∣cut tabula plumbea cum eisdem ossibus posita indicat. But Henry the eight made an end of all this vnnecessarie trouble, and charges, by remouing once for all, as well Reliques, as Religious houses. Now to returne. . Ethelinga the third Prioresse of this house, seeing the Church builded by her predecessour Domneua, not capable to containe so many holy Vir∣gins; built another Temple farre more sumptuous then the first, which was consecrated by Archbishop Cuthbert to the honour of S. Peter and Paul. She dyed ann. 751. and was buried in her owne new Church. Sexburga (saith the booke of Saint Augustine ) the daughter of Anna, king of the East Angles, the wife of Ercombert, the mother of Egbert, and othaire, all kings of Kent; after the death of her husband tooke vpon her the habite of a Nunne, and was admitted and consecrated Prioresse of this place, by Archbishop Cuthbert. In her time those furious Beare-whelps, Hungar and Hubba ( Nam vt fertur filij fuere cuiusdam vrsi, Hungar and Hubba the sonnes of a Beare. M ss in bib C t Caygraue i nia b. qui illos contra naturam de filia cuiusdam Regis generabat ) two Danish Pagans with a fierce armie first inuaded this kingdome. She dyed about the yeare 797. and was buried in this new Church. Capgraue saith at Ely. Seberitha was the first Votarie admitted, and consecrated Lady Prioresse of this house, by Ethelard Archbishop of Canterbury, who was no sooner well setled in her gouernment, then that the Danes came backe againe, and in their sauage furie ouerwhelmed the Island of Tenet, destroyed, and vt∣terly demolished this Monasterie; and her, with her holy Sisters, inclosed in secret caues for feare of the enemie; they found out, and burned them all to ashes. Capgraue, Eadburgh first English Nunne, surna∣med . a Kentish man borne, reporteth that Eadburgh the daughter of good king Ethelbert, by his vertuous Queene Berta, was brought vp a Nunne in this Monasterie, vnder the foundresse Domneua, that she suc∣ceeded Mildred in the Monasticall gouernment; that shee was buried here in this Church, and that long after, her reliques (the chiefe and most fre∣quent way in those times to enrich any new built Church) were remoued by Lanfrank, Archbishop of Canterbury, to the Church of Harbaldowne of his owne foundation, Camden in K. and there had in great veneration. But Camden, to whom I must needs giue more credit, speaking of S. Eadburghs Well at Liming in this Tract, will haue her to be the first veiled Nunne in all Eng∣land. And that she liued here in a Monastery of her owne building, that here shee dyed, Speed. Hist. and here at Lyming was buried, saith Speed, that she was surnamed, Tace, a fit name for a woman, and that she had beene the wife of Edwin king of Northumberland. Sandwich: Before the generall suppression here, was a religious house of white Friers Carmelites, The foundati∣on of the white Friers, and of the old Hospi∣tall. founded by one Henry Cowfeld an Almaine, Ann. 1272. and an Hospitall founded by Thomas Rabyng, William Swanne, Clerkes, Iohn Goddard and Richard Long. In a booke of this order of Carmes, written by Iohn Bale, of which I haue spoken in the prefixed discourse, A Manuscript. I finde the Foundation of this Religious structure, as also certaine Epitaphs made to the memorie of diuers of the Fraternitie therein interred; in this manner following.

Sir Roger Manwood before remembred, natiue of this place, founded here a free Schoole, which hee endowed with fourty pounds of yearely reuenue. Richborow. Right famous in former times (saith Camden ) was the Citie of Richbo∣row, whereof now nothing remaines, saue certaine walls of a Castie of rough flint and Britane brickes, in forme of a Quadrant. Ouer the entrie whereof is the head of Queene Berta (as some say) grauen in stone, the wife of King Ethelbert, who here had a royall pallace. The Romanes had their Presidents or Prouosts who had the gouernment of this Citie, of which I finde but onely two to haue beene here interred, namely, Flauius Sanctius, and Claudius Contentus, the one ruling with all peace, the other liuing in all riches and prosperitie: whose memories are thus preserued by the Poet Ausonius : Militiam nullo qui turbine sedulus egit, Praeside letatus quae Rhutupinus ager. His martiall seruice he discharg'd with care, without all strife: And Rutupin reioyc'd in him, whilst there he was in life. The same Authour setteth forth likewise in a lamentable funerall verse, in the praise of Claudius Contentus, whom he calls Vnkle, who being ouerta∣ken with death, left behinde him vnto strangers, a mighty great stocke of money, which he had put out to vsury among the Britaines, and increased by interest. Et patruos Elegia meos reminiscere cantus Contentum tellus quem Rhutupina tegit. Claudius Con∣tentus. My dolefull Muse now call to minde the songs of Vnkle mine, Contentus, who enterred lyes within mould Rutupine. Ca nd. Ken . Ashe-Church.

In this Church are some ancient Monuments (but now without In∣scriptions) erected to the memory of the Philipots, or Philpots, a familie which hath resided here a long time at Vpton Court, within this Parish; of which name and family was that renowned Lord Maior of London, Sir Iohn Philpot. knight, Lord Maior of Lon∣don. Stow. Annal. Sir Iohn Philpot, knighted in the field by King Richard the second, toge∣ther with Sir William Wallworth, then Maior, and other Aldermen, for the good seruice they performed against Watt Tylar and his complices, Rebels of Kent and Essex.

Ikham. Sir Thomas Ba knight. In this Church I saw an old Monument, vpon which onely these words are remaining: Hic ..... Ba miles. And in the window vnder his armes in an old character written, Thomas de Ba. Of which short surname I finde nothing related in writing, nor deliuered by word of mouth, either short or long. Chiselherst. Here is the buriall place of the Walsinghams. Monkton in the Isle of Tenet. At the West end of this Church are these verses to be read: Insula rotunda Thanatos quam circuit vnda.

Knowlton. In this Church are buried some of Ringleis, one of them kneeling in com∣pleate armour, his armes fixed on the Monument.

Lucius, the first christened king of the Britaines, built this Church, to the name and seruice of Christ, endowing it with the Toll or custome of Douer. The Priory of S. Martins, or Gods-house in Douer. Eadbald, the sonne of Ethelbert, king of Kent, to expiate his foule sinnes of incest, and infidelity, amongst other his pious actions, erected a Col∣ledge within the walls of this Castle, which Wightred (a successour of his) remoued into the Towne: stored it with two and twenty Chanons, and dedicated it to the name of Saint Martine, Regist. eccl. in bib.

A Towne famous in times past, and much frequented by the English Saxons for religion sake, by reason of a Monastery, which Eauswide the daughter of Eadbald, king of Kent, erected for religious women; of which, she became the first Prioresse. She dedicated her Church to the honour of Saint Peter, and replenished her house with blacke Nunnes: she continued herein Abbesse a long time, . and so dyed a vailed Virgin, about the yeare 673. This foundation was long ago swallowed vp with the sea; and ano∣ther built by Iohn Segraue, . and Iulian his wife, the daughter and heire of Iohn Sandwich, who was Lord of this Towne, together with Iohn Clinton, in the raigne of king Henry the third, who consecrated this their holy fa∣bricke to the honour of Saint Peter, and S. Eauswid. Whose reliques they translated, into their new built Church; there they were gloriously en ri∣ned, and she honoured for a Saint. Of whom the credulous common peo∣ple did report many strange wonders: As that shee lengthened a bean of this her religious building three foot, when the Carpenters (missing their measure) had made it so much too short: That shee haled and drew water ouer the hills against nature: That shee forbad certaine rauenous birds the countrey, which before did much hurt thereabouts: That she restored the blinde, cast out the deuill, and healed innumerable folkes of their infirmi¦ties. And therefore after her death, she was by the policie of the Church of Rome, and the Popish Priests, canonized; and by the folly of the com∣mon people (saith Lambard ) honoured for a Saint. And no maruell at all (saith hee) for it was vsuall amongst the Clergie∣men in those dayes, not onely to magnifie their Benefactours of all sorts; but to deifie also so many of them (at the least) as were of noble parentage, knowing that thereby triple commoditie ensued; the first, for as much as by that meanes they assured many great Personages vnto them: secondly, they drew (by the awe of their example) infinite numbers of the common people after them: and lastly, they aduentured the more boldly (vnder those honourable and glorious names and titles) to publish their fained miracles. And this surely was the cause that Sexburga in Shepie, Mildred in Tanet, Etheldred at Elye, Edith at Wilton, and sundrie other such wo∣men of royall bloud in each quarter, were canonized Saints: for generally the Religious of those times were as thankfull to their Benefactours, as euer were the heathen nations to their first Kings and Founders. The one for sanctifying such as did either build them houses, or deuise them Orders; and the other deifying such, as had made them Cities, or prescribed them lawes and gouernment. This was it that made Saturne, Hercules, Romulus, and others moe, to haue place (in common opinion) with the Gods aboue the starres: and this caused Dunstan, Edgar, Ethelwold, and others, first to bee shrined here in earth, and then to sit amongst the Saints in heauen. This Nunnery was va∣lued at the fatall ouerthrow of all such edifices, at 63. l. 7. s. per annum. It was surrendred 15. Nouemb. 27. H. 8. Lidde. In this Church are the pictures of a man and his wife, inlayed in brasse vpon a goodly Monument: thus inscribed. Hic iacet Thomas Godfray quondam de veteri Rumney qui obijt 5. dic mens. Aug. Ann.

The Priory neare Rumney. The Priory of Regular Canons neare Rumney, was founded by Iohn Mansell, Prouost of Beuerley, in the yeare that God tooke vpon him the forme of a Seruant, 1257. the 41. of king Henry the third: of the which foundation, as also of the Founder, reade if you please these words out of Mathew Paris. In the same yeare, saith he, Sir Iohn Mansell Prouost of Be∣uerley, the Kings Chaplaine, and of his especiall Councell, a man prudent, circumspect, and rich, wisely considering, that the fauour of a king is not hereditarie, nor the prosperitie of the world alwayes permanent: founded a Religious house of Regular Canons, neare by Rumney, two miles from the sea, and endowed it with very ample reuenues, which he replenished with Canons, by the example of Peter Chareport : who, as hee was enfor∣med, not many dayes before, had piously and prosperously founded an house of the same order, that so passing by temporall goods, they might not loose eternall.

Hee was chiefe Iustice of England, one of the priuie Councell to the said King, his Chaplaine, his Embassador into Spaine, a worthy Souldier, In armis strenuus, & animo imperterritus. who with his owne hands, in a battell betwixt the English and the French, neare to Tailborge in France, Hollins.

About the 31. yeare of King Henry the third, at the instance of the said king, he was first made keeper of the great Seale, as Vicechancellour. For, saith Paris, Paris hinne. Custodiam Sigilli regij accepit Cancellarij vices acturus et offici∣um: and afterwards Lord keeper in plenarie office and authoritie; yet for all this glorious pompe, and great promotions, I finde his end to be poore, wretched, and miserable, beyond Seas; but I finde no place of his death nor buriall: Anon. in bib.

And this was the cause that he was driuen (perforce) to defend his vsur ped authoritie by the sword, which must needs procure him the hatred of many, who thus speake of him in old English: King Stephen his luthenesse withdrew yers a fewe, Rob.

But to conclude with the words of a late writer. This Stephen was a man so continually in motion (saith he) that we cannot take his dimension, but onely in passing, and that but on one side which was warre: on the other, we neuer saw but a glaunce on him, which yet for the most part, was such as shewed him to be a very worthy Prince for the gouernment. Hee kept his word with the State, No subsidies in K Stephens time concerning the relieuement of Tributes, and neuer had Subsidy that we finde. But which is more remarkable, hauing his sword continually out, and so many defections, and rebellions against him, hee neuer put any great man to death. Besides it is noted, that notwithstanding all these miseries of war, there were more Abbeyes built in his raigne, then in an 100. yeares before: which shewes though the times were bad, they were not impious; the king himselfe being mente piissimus, omp. in bib.

Some part of it is now conuerted into a Parish Church, in which are diuers funerall Monuments, which haue beene remoued (as I conceiue) out of the Chappell adioyning: some of which make a shew of wondrous great antiquitie. One of them is thus inscribed: Hic iacent Rogerus Norwood, Roger Norwood, and Bena his wife. et Boon vxor eius sepulti ante Conquestum. The Norwoods are a worthy ancient familie I confesse; and may very wel, for any thing that I know, haue flourished before the Conquest, but I am sure that the character of this Inscription is but of later times, making but little shew of any great Antiquitie.

Here I saw some antique Monuments of the Shurland , Shurland: sometimes Lords of the Mannor of Shurland, hereunto adioyning: of whom the inhabitants haue many strange relations not worth remembring. Sir Robert Shurland flourished in the raigne of king Edward the first.

This Sir Thomas Cheyne was also Constable of Queene-borough Castle, a strong fortresse in this Isle, pleasant for sight, built by King Edward the third; to the terrour of his enemies, and solace of his people; vnto which he adioyned a Burgh, and in the honour of Philip the Queene his wife, cal∣led it Queene-borough, as one would say, the Queenes Burgh. This hath beene an office euer thought worthy of many great personages; as appeares by their Catalogue, which I copied out of the Collections of Glouer, alias Somerset. Iohn Foxley was the first Constable: Iohn of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, the second: Arnold Sauage knight, the third: Thomas Arundell, Arch∣bishop of Canterbury, the fourth: Robert de Veere, Marquesse of Dublin, and Earle of Oxford, the fifth: Iohn Cornwall, Baron Fanhope, the sixth: Gilbert Vmfreuill the seuenth: Will. le Scrope, sonne of the Lord Scrope, the eighth: Humphrey, Duke of Buckingham, the ninth: Iohn Norwood, Es∣quire, the tenth: George Duke of Clarence, the eleuenth: Sir Thomas Went∣worth the thirteenth: Sir William Cheyneie the fourteenth: Sir Francis Cheyneie the fifteenth: this Sir Thomas Cheyneie the sixteenth: Sir Richard Constable the seuenteenth: Sir Edward Hoby the eighteenth: Philip, Earle of Mountgomerie now liuing, Ann. 1630. the nineteenth. The Mannor of Shurland seated Eastward from hence, belonged to these Cheyneies, and now to the said Philip, Earle aforesaid, whom King Iames created Baron Herbert of Shurland, and Earle of Mountgomery, vpon one and the same day, viz. the fourth day of May, 1605. And whom King Charles, our dread Soueraigne, hath made Lord Chamberlaine of his Hou∣shold. And to whom at this day, by the death of his thrice noble Brother, William, Earle of Penbroke, are added the honours and titles of Earle of Penbroke, Baron Herbert of Caerdiffe in Wales, Lord Parre and Roos of Kendall, Marmion, and S. Quintin. Vlcombe. Here in this Parish was anciently the mansion house of the family De Sancto Leodegario, S. Leger, now commonly called Sellenger : one of the owners whereof, namely, Sir Thomas Sellenger, who married Anne, Duchesse of Exceter, sister to king Edward the fourth, lyeth here interred, (say the inhabitants) amongst his ancestours.

Archbishop of Canterbury, Vnckle to Eleanor the wife of king Henry the third, built (here at the confluence of the waters) a religious structure, Found. of the Colledge first an Hospitall. to the honour of Saint Peter, S. Paul, and S Thomas the Martyr, (as most call him) and endowed it with faire possessions, by the name of an Hospitall, but vsually called, The new Worke, which had not stood fully an hundred and fourty yeares, but that William Courtney, one of his Successours in this See, pulled it downe, and erected it anew, after his owne pleasure; thereby gaining the name of a Founder; and called it a Col∣ledge of secular Priests, which he consecrated to the holinesse of All Saints, which was valued at the suppression, at 139. l. 7. s. 6. d. of yearely re∣uenues. This Archbishop Courtney was sonne of Hugh Courtney, the third of that Christian name, Earle of Deuonshire, by Margaret his wife, daughter of Humphrey de Bohun, Earle of Hereford, and Essex. And being thus ho∣nourablie descended, he was no sooner entred into Orders, but that he was loaden with spirituall preferments; as a Prebend in Wells, Exceter, and Canterbury, beside Benefices with Cure, more, I thinke, then he could well discharge. The first Bishopricke he had, was Hereford, which he enioyed fiue yeares, from thence he was remoued to London, which hee gouerned about sixe yeares (in which time, saith Walsingham, he was aduanced to the dignity of Cardinal) from London to Canterbury; which gracious honour, hee enioyed 12. yeares lacking one moneth, euen vntill his death: which happened the last day of Iuly, 1396. He lyeth buried according to his will here in his owne Church, vnder a plaine graue-stone (a lowly Tombe for such an high borne Prelate) vpon which his pourtraiture is delineated, and this Epitaph inlaid with brasse about the Verge.

Leedes. There was a Priory in this Towne built, and amplie endowed by one Sir Robert Creuequer, Leedes Priory. and Adam his sonne and heire, who in ancient Re∣cords is named, de Creuequer, or de crepito corde (a Nobleman of Norman∣die, and knight to William the Conquerour) in the yeare of our redempti∣on 1107. or thereabouts, E Arch London. which he consecrated to the honour of our alone Sauiour Iesus Christ, and Saint Nicholas, and placed therein blacke Ca∣nons regular, Augustines : Rainham.

Iohn Paynter of Douer namyd I was, And two times Maire of that plas I passyd to God the thirteenth of Iuly, On thousand fyve hundryd and forty. The people of this place make a great vaunt of the best wheate in all Kent or Christendome. Now here (gentle Reader) giue me leaue to speake a little more of the Priory of Leedes, though casually misplaced, because forgotten. I finde (saith Lambard ) in a Heralds note (who belike made his con∣iecture by some coate of Armes lately apparant) that one Leybourne, an Earle of Salisbury, was the founder of this Priory. And indeed it is to be seene in the Annalls of Saint Augustines of Canterbury, Mss n ib. Cot. that a Nobleman, called Roger Leybourne, was sometime of great authoritie within this Shire, notwithstanding that, in his time he had tasted of both fortunes: for in the dayes of king Henry the third, hee was first one of that coniuration, which was called the Barons warre; from which faction Edward the kings sonne wonne him by faire meanes to his part, and made him the bearer of his pri∣uie purse. Afterward they agreed not vpon the reckoning, so that the Prince (charging him with great arrerage of account) seised his liuing for satisfaction of the debt, by which occasion Roger once more became of the Barons partie. But after the pacification made at Kenelworth, he was eft-soones receiued into fauour, and was made Warden of the fiue Ports, and Lieutenant of this whole Shire. Now though it cannot be true, that this man was the builder of this Priory (for the same Annals say, that it was erected long before) yet if hee did but marry the heire, he might truly bee termed the Patron or Founder thereof: for by that name, not onely the builders themselues, but their posterity also (to whom the glory of their deeds did descend) were wont to bee called Patrons and Founders as well as they. It is obserued, by my Author, in this place speaking of the Priory; that in ancient time, the greatest Personages held Monkes, Friers and Nunnes, in such veneration and liking, that they thought no Citie in case to flourish, no house likely to haue long continuance, no Castle sufficiently defended, where was not an Abbey, Priory, or Nunnery, either placed within the walls, or situate at hand and neare adioyning. And surely (omitting the residue of the Realme) hereof onely it came to passe, that Douer had Saint Martins ; Canterbury, Christ-Church; Ro∣chester, Saint Andrews ; Tunbridge, the Friers; Maidstone, the Chanons; Greenwich, the Obseruants; and this our Leedes, her Priory of Chanons at hand. About two hundred yeares since, A quarrell be∣tweene the Canons of Leedes and the Monkes of S. Albans. the Prior of this House, with three of his Chanons, and others; layed violent hands vpon the body of a Monke of Saint Albans, whereupon many more quarrels would haue ensued, if that Boniface the ninth, Pope of Rome (hearing thereof) had not by his Bull authorised the Abbot of Saint Edmundsbury to heare, examine, and determine all controuersies betwixt the two Houses, and to absolute the de∣linquents, after competent satisfaction made to the wronged parties. Thus goes the Bull. Bonifacius Episcopus seruus seruorum Dei; Dilecto filio Abbati Monasterij de Sancto Edmundo Norwicen. dioc. Salutem et Apostolic. ben.

I haue the rather inserted this Bull, for that it may bee the more plainly vnderstood; how the most of all causes in those times concerning the Cler∣gie, were arbitrated not alwayes by the authority of the learned Bishops of this land, but by Commissions purchased from the Bishops of Rome. This Priory was valued in the Records of the late suppression, at three hundred fourescore and two pounds of yearely reuenue. Mottenden, or Motindene. Lambard speaking of Motindene (which name hee deriues from two Saxon words, Moo and Dene, which is the proud valley, a name imposed as he thinkes for the fertilitie thereof) saith, That hee hath not heard, nor hitherto found any thing touching the Religious House of Motindene in Hetcorne, The Religious House at Mo∣tinden. saue onely that the head thereof was called Minister, and that the House it selfe was of the yearely value of sixty pounds. Neither would I (saith he) haue affoorded it so much as paper, or place here, but onely that you might vnderstand, with what number of buildings, variety of sects, and plenty of possessions, Popery was in old time prouided for, and furnished. No corner (almost) without some Religious house or other: Their sects and orders were hardly to be numbred; and as for their lands and reuenues, it was a world to behold them. I finde that the yearely ex∣tent of the cleare value of the Religious liuings within this Shire, amounted to fiue thousand pounds: Bishoprickes, Benefices, Friaries, Chaunteries, and Saints-offerings not accounted. Which thing also I do the rather note, to the end that you may see, how iust cause is giuen vs, both to wonder at the hote zeale of our ancestours in their spirituall fornication, and to lament the coldnesse of our owne charity, towards the maintenance of the true Spouse of Iesus Christ. For, if euer, now most truly is that verified, which the Poet long since said, Probitas laudatur et alget. Boxley. William de Ipre (a Towne in Flanders) the base sonne of Philip Viscount de Ipre, Boxley Abbey. Lieutenant to king Stephen, in the warres against Maud the Em∣presse: for which seruice the king created him Earle of Kent, founded this Abbey, Ann. 1146. which he consecrated to the blessed Virgine Mary, and planted it with a Couent of white Monkes, of Saint Barnards order, which he translated hither from Claravall in Burgundie, which as good children, were to follow and obey the rules and ordinances of the Abbey of Clara∣vall in all things. These are the words in the institution. Anno 1146. fundata est Boxleia in Cancia, Cart. Ant. in Arch. Turris. London. filia Claravallis propria. And further, Quod ipsa Abbathia sit subdita Abbathie de Claravalle, &c. It was ordinarie both beyond Sea and here in England, for one religious house to beget another, as will appeare by the sequele; for not many yeares after her first foundation, this Abbey it selfe was the mother of Roberts∣bridge in Sussex. The yearely value of this house was esteemed at the sup∣pression to be worth 218. l. 19. s. 10. d. This Monastery in former times was famous for a woodden Roode, The Roode of Grace at Box∣ley.

Lamb: peramb. for about the midst of the raigne of king Henry the third, this order came ouer the Sea, arriued in this land, and made their nest here at Newenden; which was at that time a wooddy and solitarie place, and there∣fore (in common opinion) the more fit for religious persons to inhabite; they were called Carmelites, of a hill in Siria named Carmelus, where at the first a sort of them liued solitarily, vntill by Iohn, Patriarch of Ierusalem, they were drawne into companies. Now to giue these sanctimonious white Brethren (such meere strangers) the better entertainment, one Sir Thomas Albuger knight, about the yeare 1241. built for them here a faire house, cal∣ling it the Friery, which he caused to bee hallowed to the honour of the Virgin Mary ; for that by Honorius Quartus the Pope, they were appoin∣ted to a rule and order by the name of the Brothers of Mary ; which title liked themselues so well, that they procured of Pope Vrban the sixth, three yeares pardon for all such as would so call them. But certaine merry fellows (saith mine Author) (seeing their vanity, and knowing how little they were of kinne to Mary the blessed Virgine) called them the Brothers of Mary Aegiptiaca the harlot. Lambard. Whereat the Pope was so offended, that hee plainly pronounced them Heretickes for their labour. He that was the Prouost or principall of this Fraternitie, was called the Prior of the house. One of which, namely, William Starnefeld, writ a Trea∣tise of the originall or beginning of this Order. What the value of this Pri∣orie was at the suppression I cannot learned. Combewell.

Vpon the Tombe of Lady Elisabeth Nevill, here interred, wife to Sir Thomas Nevill, and daughter to the Lord Dakers, and Dame Anne Grai∣stocke, Dame Elisab. N vill. this old rime is engrauen. O Lord my Sauiour and hevenly Maker, Haue mercy on Elisabeth Graistock and Daker. In what kings dayes this Lady might flourish, I haue not made much search; the character of the Inscription seemes to be ancient, and so are the families of the Nevils, Dacres, and Greystocks: as also of signall note, and exemplarie noblenesse in many parts of this kingdome; with the two first Surnames I do often meet. Thus much here then of Greystocke out of Cam∣den, as followeth. By Peterill, beside Petrianae (saith hee) standeth Greystock, a Castle be∣longing, not long since, to an honourable house, which deriued their first descent from one Ranulph Fitz-walter: Camd in Cum∣berland. of which line William, called de Greystock wedded Mary, a daughter, and one of the coheires of Sir Merley, Lord of Morpath: and hee had a sonne named Iohn, who being childlesse, by licence of king Edward the first, conueyed his inheritance to Raph Granthorpe, the sonne of William, and his Aunts sonne by the fathers side; whose male progenie flourished a long time in honour, with the title of Lord Greistock : but about king Henry the seuenth, his dayes expired, and came to an end, and so the inheritance came by marriage vnto the Barons of Dacree: and the female heires generall of the last Baron Dacre, were mar∣ried vnto Philip Earle of Arundell, and Lord William Howard, sonnes of Thomas Howard, late Duke of Norfolke. Pluckley, anciently written Plokele. This Towneship or Parish was by Archbishop Lanfrancke (in the time of William the Conquerour) giuen vnto one Iohn de Cobham, whose poste∣rity assuming a Surname from the place, did flourish here by the space of two hundred yeares, vntill the daughters of Sir William of Pluckley knight, became the coheires of this Mannor. Amongst whom, shee that onely is knowne to haue had issue, was married vnto Iohn de Surenden, alias Saren∣den, who vpon the old seate, new founded the Mannor house, (a faire one at this day, and by the antiquitie thereof seemes to haue beene the like, or much fairer at her first building) which stands vpon the very forehead of that hill which from this place doth reach Westward into Surrey. A situa∣tion so elegant, that it compares with most that are, in rich pastures, health∣full aire, and plenty both of fewell and timber: but aboue all, in a very deli∣cate and various prospect. From the owner it then receiued, and still re∣taines, the name of Surenden, although from that family it did immediatly by a daughter passe to the Noble and spreading house of Haute, whose first childe, being daughter and coheire, Christian, was married vnto Iohn De∣ring, sonne of Richard, sonne of Sir Iohn Dering of Westbroke, knight. In the possession of which family, the name of Surenden hath (by continuance) gotten its Masters Surname, to distinguish it from another of the same ap∣pellation within two miles, and so is knowne by the name of So in this County, Sutton Valence, Horton Kirby, and others, haue like distinctiue surnames. Surenden Dering. And through many descents (hauing beene at no time bought nor sold) the gift of Lanfranke now resteth in person of Sir Edward Dering, knight, and Baronet, Lieutenant of his Maiesties Castle of Douer, and of his Cinque ports; the third of that name and family of Dering, which haue enioyed this Office, being a place of especiall trust, of honour and com∣mand. In this Church, dedicated to S. Nicholas, and in our Ladies Chappell there, now belonging to Sir Antony Dering of Surenden Dering knight, and founded by Richard Dering Esquire, in the raigne of king Henry the sixth, (as appeares by his Armes carued on the bottome of the Arches, which are Or, a Salter sables, and Dering and Haute quartered Or, a Salter sables, and Or, a crosse engraled gules, thereon a cressant Argent) are seuerall graue∣stones very fairely figured, with pourtraitures in armour to the length; first one for Iohn Dering of Surenden Esquire, who liued in the dayes of King Richard the second, Henry the fourth, and Henry the fifth; some of the brasse is torne away, that which remaines is accordingly as followeth. Iohn Dering. HIC IACET &Cpunc; This riming Epitaph is inlaid with brasse about the Verge of this Mo∣nument. Hic iacet in terra, solitus sed viuere guerra, Vnde tulit vulnus quod dedit in de funus.

Next vnto him lyeth entombed his sonne Richard Dering in this forme, to whose memory no Inscription is remaining. Richard Der Richard Dering of Surenden Dering, Esquire, gaue as I haue it by rela∣tion) the hangings of rich and faire cloth of Arras, which adorne the Quire of the Cathedrall Church in Canterbury, vpon the suite of his sonne Ri∣chard Dering a Monke there; who, according to his Monkish Heraldry, hath figured in their seuerall bordures, his Rebus, or Name deuises, viz. a Dere and a Ring, in stead of Armes, although sixe embroydered Cushi∣ons, then giuen for the Priors seate, and since vsed in the Deanes Pewes, haue the Armes of Dering embroydered on them, and empaled with Ber∣tyn and Eyton his two wiues. Richard Dering the Monke, ow. Annal. was one of the adherents to Elisabeth Bar∣ton, the holy Maid of Kent, in her fained hypocrisie, and traiterous pra∣ctises. In the same Chappell lyeth Iohn Dering, Iohn Dering. Esquire, who was great grand∣childe to the foresaid Richard Dering of Surenden, whose Altar tombe is since laid flat. He dyed 1550. and hath there his figure in the wall, knee∣ling with his Surcote of Armes; with him is buried Margaret his wife, sister and sole heire of Thomas Brent, Esquire. Vnderneath the figure of Richard Dering, An Eschur∣chion. before remembred, is an Escocheon with eight coats quartered. First Dering a Salter. 2.

At the foot of this Chappell, within the Church, vnder foure seuerall Grauestones, euery one inlaid with figures of brasse at length, the men ly∣ing in Armour, are buried as followeth. Io. Dering and Iulian his wife. Iohn Dering Esquire, who dyed Ann. Dom. 1517. and Iulian his wife, sister of Sir Iohn Darrell knight, who dyed 1526. Nic Dering and his wife. On their right hand lyeth Nicholas Dering, Esquire, their eldest sonne, and Alice his wife, the daughter and coheire of the eldest house of Bet∣tenham. Dering & Bene his wife. On their left hand vnder an Arch, with the like pourtraiture in brasse at length, lyeth their second sonne, Richard Dering Esquire, the Kings Lieu∣tenant of Douer Castle, and the Cinque Ports, vnder fiue Lord Wardens. He dyed 1546. And with him is buried Benet his wife, of the ancient family of Brockholl. Diuers others of this most ancient and right worthy progenie, lye here interred; of whom (their burials being but of later times) the order of my method will not giue me leaue to speake. Hen. and Rich. Malemaines. In the body of this Church are two Grauestones, vnder one of which lyeth the body of Henry Malemaines, Esquire, and vnder the other (with his portraiture at length in brasse) Richard Malemaines Esquire, who dyed 1440. their coate of Armes thereupon engrauen. Ermyn a cheffe gules, three left hands Argent. Bethersden vnder Pluckley hill. In this Church are the Armes of Surenden twice singly, and once empa∣led with Crouch, which Surenden was there the principall Inhabitant in the time of Edward the second, being owner of a place there called Suren∣den, which now belongeth to a right worthy gentleman Edward Chute Esquire. And is seated with the view of the other Surenden, belonging as aforesaid to Sir Edward Dering. Charing. In the yeare 1590. this Church was with fire consumed all but the very stones; which fire it caught from a peece discharged at a Pigeon then vpon the Church. The windowes and the Grauestones (wherein diuers of the ancient and worthy family of Brent were memorized) at that time were defaced: yet on the outside of the Bellfree do remaine carued in stone, the badge of Edward the fourth (being a Rose within the Sunne-beames) and a Wyuer being the Armes of Hugh Brent Esquire; who in the raigne of Edward the fourth, was the principall Founder of that Bellfree, which was before of wood. From the time of Henry the sixth, the family of Brent (be∣ing branched out of the ancient stocke of Brent in Somersetshire, of which house Sir Robert de Brent was a Baron of the Parliament in the time of Edward the first) hath flourished here as the prime name of this Parish, vn∣till Thomas Brent Esquire (the last male of this line) did remoue to Willis∣borough, where he dyed issuelesse. On the South side of the Chancell here, and annexed to the Church, is a conuenient Chappell founded by Amy Brent widow of William Brent Esquire, who dyed in the raigne of Ric. the third; this (with the Church) being fired, is now in the hands of workmen to bee repaired, by Sir Ed∣ward Dering knight and Baronet, to whom the right of this Chappell is deriued, as well in bloud from the Brents, as by composition betweene him and M. Brent Dering of Charing, who now is the owner of the ancient house of the Brents there, which is full stored with the Badges of Edward the fourth, in euery quarry of glasse within the Hall-window. In which house also (as it goes by tradition) Iohn Brent Esquire, feasted King Henry the eight, as hee passed this way toward his then intended siege of Bullen. But this name of Brent is for nothing more famous, then for the warlike exploits of that wilde madbraine Falques, or Falco de Brent ; Brent the Mad∣braine. who made it nothing to raise warre against kings; to besiege and take Castles, to spoile Abbeyes, pull downe Churches, ransacke all the adioyning territories, and where I write of such a touch of wickednesse? but more of him hereafter, what not which had English persons of especiall note, as haue beene inter∣red in forraine nations. Lyd. Of Lyd I haue spoken a little in another place, yet here giue me leaue to speake a little more vpon further information. Rich. Dering & Tho. his sonne. In this Church of Lyd were two Grauestones of Richard Dering, who dyed in the raigne of king Ri∣chard the second, and Thomas his sonne, one of them had faire portraitures with ornaments engrauen thereon: but the losse of some of the brasse, with the remote absence of his posterity, haue giuen occasion for another name to superscribe that stone; although at that time the best, if not the onely names of note and gentrie there, were Septuanus and Dering : at which time Dering was here owner of Westbrooke, and of Deuge Marsh place, which name hath beene of great and ancient possessions in Lyd, Midley, Prom∣hill, and old Rumney, whereof a part was the leuell of foure hundred Acres of land, called yet by the name of Derings : and on the other side of Lyd aboue threescore Acres by the name of Derings Droff. From hence Iohn Dering Esquire, in the time of Henry the seuenth, was taken out of his house and carried into France, from whence by ransome he freed himselfe. Chart Magna. Betweene the Chancell and the North Chappell of this Church, is an Altar-Tombe, round about the verge of which, is engrauen this Epitaph following in brasse, and betwixt euery word the figure of a well, alluding to the name of the parties there vnderneath interred.

Here is also a Monument, whereupon a man armed is pourtraied, the Inscription whereof is altogether perished; which in all likelihood was made to the memory of Sir William Barry, knight, the husband of the fore-remembred Isabell. At the lower end of the Church, and neare to the Bellfree, lyeth the body of one of these Barryes pourtraied in compleat armour, about the Verge of his Monument this Inscription. Hic iacet Vmfridus Barre Ar. Quondam Dominus istius ville et Patro∣nus istius Ecclesie. Humfrey Barry. Qui obiit in die Sancte Marie Magdalene, An. Dom. 1431. Cuius anime propitietur Deus. Amen. Camden in his Chorographicall description of Ireland, and in the Coun∣ty of Corke, writes greatly to the honour of this surname of Barry. These are his words as followeth. Beneath Corke (saith he) the riuer, parting in twaine, enuironeth a large and very pleasant Island, ouer against the principall dwelling house of that most ancient and noble family of the Barries, which thereupon is called Barry Court. For, that family is deriued from Robert de Barry an English man, a personage of great worth, and renowned: who notwithstanding chose rather among the first to be chiefe indeed, then to seeme chiefe: who in the winning of Ireland, Robert Barry the first in land that broughthawke to hand: receiued wounds and hurt: and the first man he was in Ireland that manned and brought the Hawke to hand. His posterity by their long approued loyaltie, and martiall prowesse, deserued to receiue of the kings of England, first the title of Baron Barry, afterwards of Vicount Butiphant, and for their great lands and wealth, gat among the people the surname of Barry More, that is, Barry the Great. ..... Iohannes Fynch Armiger, Qui obiit 19. die Mensis Maij, Ann. Dom 1442. Cuius. This I conceiue to be some younger branch of the Nobly descended family of the Finches, of whom there is mention made among the Monuments in Bra∣borne Church before, where they are stiled Herbert, vel Finch, not vnaptly thereby continuing the memory of their originall name and ancestry, as being lineally de∣scended from Hen. Fuz-Herbert, Chamberlaine to king Henry the first, who mar∣ried the daughter and heire to Sir Robert Corbert : Vide Vincent contra Brooke pag. 130. and had issue by her, a sonne na∣med Herbert, who likewise had issue a sonne, named Herbert Fitz-Herbert. Who by his first wife Luce, daughter and coheire of Milo, Earle of Hereford, and high Constable of England, had issue a sonne, named Peter Fitz Herbert (from whom the Herberts Earles of Penbrooke are descended) and by Matilda his second wife (after his death re-married to the Lord Columbarij, ) he had issue M S.

Mathew Fitz-Herbert, who was one of the Magnates, or Barons at the making of Magna Charta, and was likewise one of those potent Noblemen for the king, that made the accord betweene king Iohn, and the Barons at Runnyng Mead, betweene Windsore and Stanes: his sonne likewise, called Herbert Fitz Mathew, was the fourth Baron that is mentioned in the Rowl of the Parliament at Tewkesbury. The change of this name Finch, seemeth to haue beene about the latter end of king Hen. the third (at which time many other families suffered like alteration) as appeareth by a super∣sedeas, Ann. 8. E. 2. therein mentioning, that Herbertus Filius Herberti dicti Finch, was a Ward, 28. E. primi, and so could not personally serue with the king in his warres in Scotland, and therefore was released of his Escuage for all his lands in Kent and Sussex, which, together with some of the ancient patrimony and seuen knights sees at Nethersfield in the County of Sussex, are not yet alienated from this honorable family, who by their paternall Ancestors and Matches are descended from many honorable houses, and especially by Sir Moyle Finches Lady, Elizabeth, sole daughter and heire to Sir Thomas Heneage, Vicechamberlaine and Councellor of Estate to Queene Elizabeth, by whom she had many children: and in her wid∣dowhood receiued from King Iames the dignity of Vicecountesse of Maydestone; and by King Charles was created Countesse of Winchelsey, to her and to her heires Males. ARCHBISHOPS OF CANTER∣BVRY CANONIZED SAINTS. . Austin Archbishop. A Nd first to begin with the first, which was Austin the Monke, famous for the many miracles which he wrought, if we may beleeue the Legend. Amongst which, this fol∣lowing is said to be one. Saynt Austyn entryd into Dorsetshyr (giue me leaue to vse the character of my old Agon) and came into a town wher as wer wycked peple, and refusyd hys doctryn and preching vtter∣ly, and droof hym out of the town, castyng on hym the tayles of Thornback, or like fishes. Wherfor hee bysought almyghty God to shew hys Iudgement on them: And God sent to them a shame∣ful token. For the chyldren that were borne after in that place had tayles, as it is said, tyl they repentyd them. It is seyd comynly that this fill at Strode in Kent, but blessyd be God at thys day is no such deformyte. The first of these fables is likewise written by Alexander Esseby, saith Lambard, and the later by Polydore Virgil, who fathers it vpon Thomas Bec∣ket (handling that hot contention betweene king Henry the second, and Thomas Becket ) saith, that Becket (being at the length reputed for the kings enemy) began to be so commonly neglected, contemned, and hated, that when as it happened him vpon a time to come to Stroude, the inha∣bitants thereabouts (being desirous to despite that good Father) sticked not to cut the taile from the horse on which he roade, binding themselues thereby with a perpetuall reproach: For afterwards (by the will of God) it so happened, that euery one which came of that kindred of men which had played that naughty pranke, were borne with tailes, euen as brute beasts be. Thus Polidore Virgils History (howsoeuer if you respect the stile, me∣thod, and matter, a good worke) is blemished with this, and other old wiues tales and follies. olidor. the Popes colle∣ctour. For as hee was by office a collectour of the Peter∣pence to the Popes gaine and lucre, so sheweth he himselfe throughout by practise, a couetous gatherer of lying fables, fained to aduance, not Peters, but the Popes owne Religion, kingdome, and Miter, saith my foresaid Author. The day of the Translation was anciently kept holy, the 26. day of May. . Honorius Archbishop. The next canonized Archbishop which I finde, was Honorius, who was vnus ex discipulis beati Pape Gregorij vir magne reuerentie, & in rebus Ec∣clesiasticis sublimiter instructus : one of the Schollers of blessed Pope Grego∣ry, a man of great reuerence, and in Ecclesiasticall affaires, highly instructed; saith Capgraue, in the life of the holy Saint. Honorius propter virtutem et Euangelij predicandi studium, Hist. Eccl. Ang. Sex . sar. c. 8. honorandus plane et suspiciendus. Honorius, for his vertue and studious endeuour of propagating the Gos∣pell, throughly to be honoured and had in admiration, saith Harpsfeld. Many are the miracles attributed to his holinesse, which were performed before, vpon, and after the translation of his Reliques; which are needlesse to relate, being like the rest of that kinde, incredible. The third Saint of this See in Capgraues Calender, S. Deodat Archbishop. is, Deus-dedit, A deo datus, or Deodat, for before his name was Frithona, (so named after his election to this Archbishopricke) of which a late writer thus descants in his Canto of the Catalogue of ancient English Saints. Of Canterbury here with those I will begin, M Drayton, Polyol. 24▪ Song. That first Archbishops See, on which there long hath bin So many men deuout, as raisd that Church so high, Much reuerence, and haue wonne their holy Hierarchy: Of which the first that did with goodnesse so in flame The hearts of the deuout (that from his proper name) As one (euen) sent from God, the soules of men to saue, The title vnto him of Deodat they gaue. Verus erat Dei cultor: vitiorum mortificator: Virtutum amator: verbi di∣uini non segnis sator, &c. He was a true worshipper of the euerliuing God: a mortifier of vices: a louer of vertues: no slow vnprofitable sower of the diuine word; and so forth. In the like phrase much more is deliuered by Capgraue, of this holy Bishop and Confessour. He writ a booke of the Bishops of Canterbury, his predecessour, as witnesseth Pitseus. That learned Priest Theodore succeeded Deodat, S. Theodore Archbishop. as in seat, so in Sainting. Vnto this man all the British Bishops, and generally all Britaine, yeelded obedience; first he was in his life, as also in his discipline, exercising the au∣thoritie of his place wondrous seuerely. Neuer before his time had England so many happy dayes, nor so many learned men, as vnder him, and a little after. Much might be said of his sanctity, out of Capgraue, and others: but I will make an end, with his end, out of an old Manuscript. Theodor yat was of Cawnterbury, Erchbysshcoppe than, and eke the hygh Prymat▪ Of fowrscor yer of age so than did dy, That twenty yer and two held that estat, To grete honore, and worschippe fortunat. The yer of Crist syr hundryd forscore and ten, Was, whan hys sowl fro fleshe was lesed clen. . Odo Arch∣bishop. Odo, surnamed Seuerus, the Confessour, for his singular austeritie of life, and many vertues, is reckoned in the new Legend amongst the Saints. Of whom the foresaid Author of Polyalbion thus sings. Then Odo the Seuere, who highly did adorne That See (yet being of vnchristened Parents borne, Whose countrey Denmarke was, but in East-England dwelt) He being but a childe, in his cleare bosome felt The most vndoubted truth, and yet vnbaptiz'd long; But as he grew in yeares, in spirit so growing strong. And as the Christian Faith this holy man had taught, He likewise for that faith in sundry battels fought. S. Dunstane Archbishop. Dunstan succeeded Odo, whose miracles by him wrought, are said to be so many, and so farre beyond beleefe, that where to begin I know not, much lesse where to end; I will looke vpon him as I finde him lying on his death-bed; where hee saw many strange visions of heauenly ioyes were shewed vnto him for his great comfort. And vpon holy Thursday (to vse the words of the old Legend) he sente for alle hys brethren, and askyd of them foryeuenesse, and alsoo forgaue them all trespaces, and assoyled them of all theyr synnes, and the thyrd dey aftyr he passyd owt of this world to God, full of vertues, the yere of our Lord ix honderd lxxxviii, and hys sowle was borne vp to Heuen wyth mery song of aungels, all the peple hering that were at his deth: and his body lyeth at Cawnterbury in a worschipful shryne, wher as owr Lord sheweth for his Seruant S. Dunston many faire and grete myracles; wherfor owr Lord be pr ysed world wythouten end. Amen. His reliques, saith Capgraue, were remoued to Glastenbury, about foure and twenty yeares after his departure. And so it is very probable, for there he was first a Brother of the House, and afterwards Abbot: there the deuill came to him dancing, by which the deuils merriment, Dunstan knew the in∣stant time of the death of Edmund, the Brother of Athelstane slaine at Pucklechurch.

But at another time this merry deuill (or some other) came to him in another moode, in likenesse of a Beare, and would haue handled with rough Mittins, as the prouerbe is, yet Dunstane had the better in the con∣flict, being neuer abasht with such an hellish encounter, vpon which the foresaid Author of Polyolbion doth thus comment. — Dunstan as the rest arose through many Sees, Song. 1 .

The day consecrated to the memory of this Saint, was the 19. of May; more of him (if it be not needlesse) when I come to Glastonbury.

Egelnoth surnamed The Good, is likewise calendred amongst these Saint∣ed Archbishops. S. Egelnoth Archbishop▪ He was the sonne of an Earle, called Agelmare, and is said to haue beene Deane of Christ-Church in Canterbury: which at that time was replenished for the most part with Canons, wearing the habite and garments of Monkes; but in profession and manner of life, differing much from them. Therefore when as in that same terrible tithing of the Danes (in the time of Elphege ) all the Monkes were slaine, except onely foure, the Canons that were now the greater number, gaue vnto their go∣uernour the name of Deane, from which place he was taken to bee Arch∣bishop. Going to Rome to fetch his Pall, he bought an arme of that blessed Fa∣ther S. Augustine, Bishop of Hippo, for an hundred talents of siluer, and a talent of gold, Godwin. and bestowed it vpon the Church of Couentrie. Hee be∣stowed great paines and cost in repairing his Church and Monastery, de∣stroyed and burnt by the Danes, and by his good aduise, directed King Knute (that fauoured him exceedingly) vnto many honourable enterprises. He dyed, Octob. 29. Ann. 1038. hauing sat Archbishop seuenteene yeares, and vpward. — Egelno h againe much grac'd that sacred Seat, Who for his godly deeds, surnamed was the Good, Not boasting of his birth, though com'n of Royall bloud: For that, nor at the first, a Monkes meane Cowle despis'd, With winning men to God, who neuer was suffic'd. — Eadfine next ensues, . Ea e Archbishop. To propagate the truth, no toyle that did refuse. He was a secular Priest, and first Chaplaine vnto king Harold, who pre∣ferred him to the Bishopricke of Winchester, from whence hee was remo∣ued to this See of Canterbury. He departed this life Octob. 28. An. 1050. after he had continued Archbishop twelue yeares almost: All which time he was much oppressed with sicknesse; he was interred in his owne Church, and at the place of his buriall, many miracles are said to haue beene wrought. S. Lanfranke Archbishop▪ Lanfranke (of whom I haue written before) is recorded by Capgraue amongst our English Saints: who saith, that vpon his first entrance to this Metropoliticall gouernment, he found the Monkes of Canterbury, sicut omnes fere tum temporis in Anglia secularibus similes : as all the rest were almost at that time in England, like to secular persons: for, Venari, aucupa∣ri, et potibus indulgere consueuerunt: They accustomed to hunt, hawke, and giue their minde to excessiue drinking, which after a short time, by gen∣tle perswasions, he reclaymed. He was a man affable, pleasant, and humble, skilfull in many Sciences, prudent in counsell, and gouernment of things, and for Religion and life most holy. Meruit ergo inter Sanctos annumerari: Therefore he deserues to be numbred amongst the Saints. S. Anselm Archbishop. Anselm for integritie of life, and depth of learning, euen admirable, in regard whereof, and of the many miracles which are said to be wrought by him liuing, and by his Reliques, he being dead; hee was canonized a Saint, about foure hundred yeares after his decease, at the great charges of Iohn Moorton, one of his Successours in the Archbishopricke. Out of his learned braine he brought forth into the world many pro∣found works, at the least fiftie seuerall bookes or Treatises: many of which are still extant. The miracles likewise attributed to his holinesse, are many, mentioned by Capgraue. The next that comes into this Catalogue, is that farre famed Saint, Tho∣mas Becket, S. Thomas com∣monly called Thomas of Canterbury▪ of whom I haue already spoken enough in another place. Thus much then at this time out of Polyolbion, as followeth. Saint Thomas Becket then, which Rome so much did honourd. hery, As to his christned name it added Canterbury; There to whose sumptuous Shrine the neere succeeding ages, So mighty offerings sent, and made such pilgrimages, Concerning whom, the world since then hath spent much breath, And many questions made both of his life and death. If he were truly iust, he hath his right, if no, Those times were much to blame, that haue him reckon'd so. Edmund (a man famous for his vertue and great learning) was borne at Abingdon in Barkeshire, S. Edmund Archbishop. being sonne to one Edward Rich a Merchant, his mothers name was Mabell. In their elder yeares they forsooke each other by mutuall consent, and betooke themselues to a Monasticall life. Edmund their sonne they caused to bee brought vp in Vniuersity Colledge in Ox∣ford. Hauing attained to reasonable perfection in the knowledge of Diui∣nitie (whereunto his study was chiefly addicted) hee applyed himselfe to preaching, wherein he tooke great paines, namely, in the Counties of Ox∣ford, Glocester, and Worcester, vntill such time as hee was called to the Treasureship of Salisbury. From whence (little knowing of any such mat¦ter, and much against his minde) he was chosen (at the Popes request, to the Monkes of Christ-Church, being as then at Rome) to be Archbishop of this See, and consecrated at Canterbury, with all honour possible, by Roger, Bishop of London, the fourth of the Nones of Aprill, about the yeare 1230. King Henry the third, thirteene Bishops, one and fourty Lords and Earles, and others innumerable being there present; as it is thus recorded in the Annalls of the Monastery of Wauerley in Surrey.

But howsoeuer he was thus solemnly consecrated, he presently fell into the kings displeasure, by opposing himselfe against the marriage of Elianor the kings sister with Simon Mountfort, Earle of Leicester, because vpon the death of the Earle Marshall, her first husband, she had vowed chastity. To haue this vow dispensed withall, the King procured the Pope to send a Le∣gate into England, his name was Otto a Cardinall. Him also this Archbi∣shop offended, and that so grieuously, by reprehending his monstrous co∣uetousnesse, his bribery and extortion, as euer after he sought to worke him all the mischiefe that he might. The Monkes of Rochester had presented vnto this Archbishop one Richard de Wendouer, demanding of him conse∣cration vnto the Bishopricke of their Church, which he vtterly denyed to affoord, knowing the presented, to bee a very vnlearned and vnsufficient man. Hereupon the Monkes appealed to Rome, which the Archbishop vnderstanding of, hasted him thither also. Otto the Legate endeauoured to stay him at home, and failing thereof, did his errand so well at Rome, as not onely in that suite, but another also which hee had against Hugh Earle of Arundell in another cause of appeale, he was ouerthrowne, and condemned in a thousand Markes charges to his great disgrace and impouerishment. Being at Rome, hee had complained of many great abuses in England, and amongst the rest, of the long vacancie of Bishoprickes. The Pope seemed willing to redresse these things, and namely, concerning that matter, set downe this order, Popes ab∣solute power. That if any Cathedrall Church continued voide aboue sixe moneths, it should be lawfull for the Archbishop to conferre it where he list, as well as any smaller Benefice. The procuring of this order cost him a great summe of money. Yet no sooner was his backe turned, but the Pope, at the kings request, reuoked the same. Being thus continually vexed, thwarted, and disgraced, hee departed into voluntary exile, and there be∣wayling the misery of his countrey, H s ty nny spoyled and wasted by the tyranny of the Pope, spent the rest of his dayes in continuall teares. Through ex∣treame griefe and sorrow, or (as some thinke) too much fasting, hee fell first into a Consumption, and after into a strange kinde of Ague. Whereupon he thought good to remoue from the Abbey of Pontiniac in France (where he had layen euer since his comming out of England) and there departed this life the sixteenth of the Kalends of December, 1242. His heart and en∣trailes were buried at Soissy, his body at Pontiniac. Sanctus Edmundus Cantuarie Archiepiscopus, plenus virtutibus, et san∣ titate migrauit ab hoc seculo, XVI. Kal. Decemb. et apud Pontiniacum se∣pultus est; Cuius merita miracula testantur. Hic erat Edmundus anima tum corpore mundus, Quem non immundus poterat peruertere mundus: Anglorum Genti faueas Edmunde petenti. Within six yeares after his death he was canonized a Saint, by Innocen∣tius the fourth, who appointed the foresaid day of his death for euer to be kept holy in memory of him. Lewes the French king caused his body to be translated to a more honourable Tombe then it was first laid in, and be∣stowed a sumptuous Shrine vpon him, couered with gold & siluer, and rich∣ly adorned with many pretious stones: where our Lord (saith his Legend) hath shewyd many a fayre myracle for his holy servaunt Saynte Edmonde. This Edmund is the last Archbishop of Canterbury that I finde to haue beene canonized; howsoeuer I dare pronounce, that since his dayes to these present times, wherein we liue; we haue had many Archbishops both for life and learning, as worthy the honour of canonization, as was himselfe, or any of these by me before remembred. Thus much of this Diocesse vntill I be further stored of funerall Monu∣ments, or other matters therein according to my method, either by my selfe, or my friends; onely let me tell you for a conclusion, that the whole Prouince of this Bishopricke of Canterbury: The conclusi∣on of this Dio∣cesie. which first of all was appa∣relled by Austin the Monke with the Archbishop of Londons Pall (as I haue in part touched before) was at the first diuided by Theodore (seuenth Bishop) into fiue Diocesses onely; howbeit in processe of time, it grew to twentie and one, The of . besides it selfe, leauing to Yorke (which by the first insti∣tution should haue had as many as it) but Durham, Carleil, and Chester onely (except you reckon the Isle of Man.) And whereas by the ordinance of Pope Gregory, either of these Archbishops should haue vnder him twelue inferiour Bishops, and that neither of them should bee subiect, or of lesse grace and dignitie then other; Lanfrancke (thinking it good reason that he should make a Conquest of the English Clergie, since his Master King William had vanquished the whole Nation) contended (at Windsore) with Thomas Norman (Archbishop of Yorke) for the Primacie, and there by iudgement before Hugo the Popes Legate, Conuention for the . recouered it from him; so that euer since the one is called, Totius Angliae Primas: and the other, Ang∣liae Primas : without any further addition. Moreouer, whereas before time, the place of this Archbishop in the ge∣nerall Councell, was to sit next to the Bishop of Saint Ruffines. Anselme (the successour of this Lanfranke ) (for recompence of the seruice hee had done in oppugning the marriage of Priests, The Archbi∣shops the generall . and resisting the king, for the inuestiture of Clerkes) was by Pope Vrbane endowed with this accession of honour, that hee and his Successours, should from thenceforth haue place in all generall Councels, at the Popes right foote, who then said withall: Includamus hunc in orbe nostro, tanquam alterius orbis Papam, Let vs include this Bishop in our owne Orbe, as it were the Pope or Fa∣ther of another world. In former ages (saith Camden in this tract) during the Romane Hierar∣chie, the Archbishops of Canterbury were Primates of all Britaine, Legates to the Pope, and as Vrbane the second said, The Patriarkes, as it were, of a∣nother world. And thus the Archbishops of Canterbury, by the fauour which Austin had with Gregory the Great, by the power of Lanfranke, and by the indu∣strie of Anselme, Lambard were much exalted: but how much that was to the grie∣uous displeasure, and pining enuie of the Archbishops of Yorke, you shall perceiue by that which followeth. King Henry the first, kept vpon a time his stately Christmas at Wind∣sore, where (the manner of our kings then being at certaine solemne times to weare their Crownes) Thurstine of Yorke hauing his Crosse borne vp before him) offered to set the Crowne vpon the kings head. But William of Canterbury withstood it stoutly, and so preuailed by the fauour of the King, and the helpe of the standers by, that Thurstine was not onely disap∣pointed of his purpose, but he (and his Crosse also) thrust quite out of the doores. William of Yorke (the next in succession after Thurstine, both in the See and Quarrell) perceiuing that the force of his Predecessour preuailed no∣thing, attempted by his owne humble meanes (first made to the king, and after to the Pope) to winne the Coronation of king Henry the second, from Theobald the next Archbishop of Canterbury: But when he had receiued repulse in that sort of suite also, and found no way left to make auenge∣ment vpon his enemy, he returned home all wroth, and (as it was suspected) wreaked the anger vpon himselfe. After this another hurly burly hapned in a Synode assembled at West∣minster, in the time of King Henry the second, before Cardinall Hugo (Pope Alexanders Legate) betweene Richard and Roger, then Archbishops of these two Sees, vpon occasion, that Roger of Yorke comming of purpose (as it should seeme) first to the assembly, had taken vp the place on the right hand of the Cardinall: Which when Richard of Canterbury had espied, hee refused to sit downe in the second roome; complaining greatly of this preiudice done to his See. Whereupon after sundrie replyes of speech, the weaker in disputation (after the manner of Schoole-boyes in the streets) descended from hote words, to hastie blowes: in which encounter the Archbishop of Canterbury (through the multitude of his attendants) ob∣tained the better. So that he not onely plucked the other out of his place, and all to rent his casule, Chimer, and Rochet, but also disturbed the holy Synode therewithall; in such wise, that the Cardinall, for feare, betooke him to his feete, the company departed, their businesse vndone, and the Bishops themselues moued suite at Rome, for the finishing of their con∣trouersie. By these, and such other successes, on the one side, the Bishops of Canterbury following, tooke such courage, that from thenceforth they would not permit the Bishops of Yorke to beare vp the Crosse, either in their presence, or Prouince. And on the other side, the Bishops of Yorke conceiued such griefe of heart, disdaine and offence, that from time to time they spared no occasion to attempt both the one and the other. Whereupon, in the time of a Parliament holden at London, in the raigne of King Henry the third, Boniface, Archbishop of Canterbury, interdicted the Londiners, because they had suffered the Bishop of Yorke to beare vp his Crosse whiles he was in the Citie. And much adoe there was (with∣in a few yeares after) betweene Robert Kilwarby of Canterby, and William Giffard of Yorke, because he of Yorke aduanced his Crosse, as hee passed through Kent towards the generall Councell. The like happened also, at two other seuerall times, betweene Frier Peckham, Archbishop of Canterbury, and William Wickwane, and Iohn de Roma, Archbishops of Yorke, in the dayes of King Edward the first. At the length, the matter being yet once more set on foote, betweene Simon Islip (the Archbishop of this Prouince, and his aduersarie the incumbent of Yorke for that time) King Edward the third, The end of the strife for the Primacie. in whose raigne that vari∣ance was reuiued, resumed the matter into his owne hand, and made a fi∣nall composition betweene them. The which hee published vnder his broade Seale to this effect. First, that each of them should freely, and without impeachment of the other, beare vp his Crosse in the others Pro∣uince; but yet so, that he of Yorke and his Successours for euer, in signe of subiection, should within two moneths after their inthronization, either bring, or send to Canterbury, the image of an Archbishop bearing a Crosse, or some other Iewell, wrought in fine gold, to the value of fourty pounds, and offer it openly there vpon Saint Thomas Beckets Shryne: then, that in all Synodes of the Clergie, and assemblies where the King should happen to bee present, hee of Canterbury should haue the right hand, and the other the left. Finally, that in broad streets, and high-wayes, their Crosse-bearers should go together, but that in narrow lanes, and in the entries of doores and gates, the Crosier of Canterbury should go be∣fore, and the other follow, and come behinde. Thus (as you see) the Bishops of Canterbury euermore preuailing by fauour, or other meanes; they of Yorke were driuen in the end, to giue ouer in the plaine field. Here endeth the Diocesse of Canterbury▪ ANCIENT FVNERALL MONV∣MENTS WITHIN THE Diocesse of ROCHESTER. T His Bishopricke is so ouershadowed by the nearnesse and greatnesse of the See of Canterbury, that it lookes but like a good Benefice, for one of his Graces Chap∣laines; yet for antiquitie and dignitie of a long succes∣sion of reuerend Lord Bishops, it may equally compare with its neighbour of Canterbury. For they had both one Founder, to wit, Ethelbert king of Kent, who built this Church to the honour of Saint Andrew, and endowed it with cer∣taine lands, which he called Priestfield, in token that Priests should bee su∣stained therewithall. Vnto which, Iustus a Romane (of whom before) was consecrated Bishop by Saint Augustine, Ethelbert assenting thereto by his presence. Hardin . ca. 88 Austin then, made Clerke full well grounded Iusto that hight, of Rochester full well bounded The Bishop then to preache, and helpe Austin And to baptise the folke by his doctrine. This Citie pent within so straight a roome, was called in the time of the Saxon Kings, the Kentishmens Castle, and at this day, shee and her little Diocesse, may make their vaunt, of their impregnable fortification by the Name Royall; the maine defence of Britaines great Monarchie, of the prowesse of their ancient Inhabitants, of the pleasant scituation of so many countrey▪ townes, and of the profits arising from the fruitfulnesse of the soile. Of all which reade, if you please, this Hexasticon. . Vrbs antiqua, ferox, bella est Rocestria situ, Arx & finitimis imperiosa locis.

This Diocesse (for the most part) is seuered from that of Canterbury by the riuer of Medway: it consists onely of foure distinct Deaneries, namely, Rochester, Malling, Dartford, and Shorham. Yet Shorham is but a Pecu∣liar to the Archbishop, who holds his prerogatiue wheresoeuer his lands do lie. This Bishopricke is valued in the Exchequer at 358. l. 3. s. 7. d. farthing, and was wont to pay to the Pope for first-fruits 1300. ducates, and for Peter-pence, 5. l. 12. s. Eightie Bishops and one haue sitten in this Chaire of Rochester, more in number by nine then in that of Canterbury. His name that now gouerneth the Helme, is that right reuerend Father in God, Iohn Bowles, Doctor of Diuinitie, brought vp in Trinitie Colledge in Cambridge. In the whole numerous race of these Bishops, Lamb. peramb. succeeding Iustus, three amongst others lye here interred (howsoeuer no remembrance is now re∣maining of them, by any funerall Monument) most notable: Paulinus, Gundulphus, and Gilbertus. Of which, the first, after his death, was honou∣red for a Saint. The second was the best Benefactour that euer this Church found. The third was so hatefull and iniurious to the Monkes, that they nei∣ther esteemed him while he was liuing, nor wailed him at all, after that he was dead. Paulinus, Paulinus Bi∣shop of Roche∣ster, and first of Yorke. a Romane borne, was first made Bishop of Yorke by Iustus his predecessour in this place, as then Archbishop of Canterbury; about the 21. day of Iuly, in the yeare of our Lord, 625. and so he is reckoned to be the first Archbishop of that Prouince. Beda. l. 2. c. . Yet I finde a Succession of British Archbishops of that place long before his time, euer since the yeare of Grace, one hundred and eightie, or thereabouts. Wherein Lucius, king of the Britaines, receiued the Christian faith; the last of which race, was one Tadiacus ; who, at the comming in of the Saxons, was, with most of his countreymen, enforced to flie into the mountanous countries of Cornwall, and Wales, Mss. in bib. Cot. and so consequently to forsake his pontificall Grace and Dig∣nitie. Of all which may it please you reade these verses out of the collecti∣ons of Tho. Talbot, sometime keeper of Records in the Tower. Turbatis rebus Archipresul Tadiacus, Ecclesie sedem deserit et patriam. Archipontificum Tadiacus sedis Eborum, Vltimus ex Britonum gentibus ille fuit. Corpora sanctorum simul omnia vasa sacrorum▪ Cunctas res reliquas transtulit ille sacras. Expulsi Britones nomen patriamque relinquunt, Dicti Wallenses nomine barbario. But to returne againe to Paulinus, from whom I am by occasion digres∣sed, who, being now inuested in the sanctimonious robes of a Bishop: ne∣uer rested a moment, but either instructed the people, that flocked about him, by preaching, or else imparted Christ vnto them by Baptisme, which he ministred in the open fields and Riuers (Churches, Oratories, Fonts, or places of Baptisme being not as yet builded) it is said that in the Riuer of Swale in Yorkeshire, Bedal . . hee christened in one day aboue ten thousand men, besides women and little children; which said riuer was a long time after reputed sacred amongst the ancient English. Camd. in Ric . He wonne miraculously Ed∣win, king of Northumberland, vnto Christ: who with all the Nobilitie of his countrey, and most part of the Commons hauing receiued the true faith, came to the lauatorie of holy regeneration, the eleuenth yeare of his raigne, which was the yeare of our Lord, 627. Thus Paulinus continued in the Prouince of Yorke, B l. l. 2. c. 2 preaching the word, and administring the blessed Sacraments, the space of seuen yeares, euen vntill the death of King Edwin ; presently vpon which, the State of his kingdome was so much infested with great slaughter, and cruell persecution; that no safetie could therein bee found, either for himselfe, or for the widow of King Edwin, Queene Edel∣burgh (both of them being Gods instruments for the conuersion of the Northumbrians to the embracement of Christian Religion) saue onely by flight. Whereupon he was constrayned to leaue his Bishopricke, and to accompanie the said Queene (with whom not long before hee came into that countrey) backe againe into this kingdome of Kent. But of Paulinus his first admittance to Yorke, and his returne backe, thus much in old La∣tine rimes. Hist. Archiepis. Ebor. in bib. Cot.

At his returne from Yorke, this See of Rochester was vacant: and at the offer of Archbishop Honorius, and at the request of King Edbald, he tooke vpon him that charge, which he right wisely and religiously gouerned the space of thirteene yeares; vntill, at his full and ripe age, he was called away by death, to receiue the glorious reward of his blessed labours. Which happened Octob. the tenth, Ann. 644.19. yeares 2. moneths, and 21. dayes, after his first consecration: This Paulinus (the third Bishop of this Diocesse) was first interred vnder a very seemely Monument, in the old Church of King Ethelberts foundation; but about foure hundred and thirty yeares afterwards, being canonized for a Saint, his reliques were remoued, (enshrined in a coffin all of curious wrought siluer) into the body of the new built Church, by Gundulphus one of his Successours: to the which (ac∣cording to the manner of those times) much concourse of people came, with many rich oblations: such was his Epitaph. Ex lib. Anon. in bib Cott. Siste gradum clama qui perlegis hoc Epigramma Paulinum plora quem substraxit breuis hora Nobis per funus: de Presulibus fuit vnus, Prudens, veridicus, constans, & firmus amicus Anni sunt rati Domini super astra regentis, Quadraginta dati quatuor cum sex quoque centis. Paulinus being dead, Honorius Archbishop of Canterbury, aduanced one Ithamar, Ithamar Bishop of Rochester. a Kentishman borne, to his place, the first Englishman of this Nation that was a Bishop. A man nothing inferiour either in life or learning to Paulinus, or any of his Italian predecessours. He departed this life about the yeare 656. Many miracles are said to be wrought by this reli∣gious Ithamar, and great concourse of people frequented the place of his buriall, which was (at the first) in the body of the Church. But afterwards his reliques were remoued by Bishop Gundulph, Cap. in vit. S. Ithamari. and enshrined; and after him by Iohn Bishop of this Church: who by his prayers at his Shrine was cured, ab acerrimo oculorum dolore, of a grieuous paine in his eyes. For this and many other signes and tokens of his sanctitie, hee was canonized (if we may beleeue Capgraue ) and the fourth of the Ides of Iune solemnized to his memory. Of whom a late writer, thus.

I will vse his owne language. Tobias a Brithwaldo Archiepiscopo consecratus, Harps. Hi Ec∣cles.

Hee dyed about the yeare 726. Here lyeth interred Gundulphus, Gundulph Bi∣shop of Ro∣chester. a Norman by birth, the thirtieth Bishop of Rochester, a man not greatly learned, but very wise and industrious: for he handled the matter so, as hee procured not onely his Church to be new built, but also the reuenues to be encreased. He recouered diuers lands and possessions encroched vpon, and taken away in former times by Odo, Earle of Kent. Godwin de prae¦ ul. Ang. And besides diuers summes of money, which hee contributed, he bought a certaine Mannor called Heddre, and gaue it to this his owne Church. In all these matters hee was much helped by Lanfranke, Archbi∣shop of Canterbury, who caused him to take into his Church, not secular Priests, as before had beene accustomed, but Monkes Benedictines. Gun¦dulph himselfe being a Monke of that order, vpon his first admittance to this See, he found onely sixe secular Priests in the Church, who were en∣dowed scarcely with sufficient meanes to liue according to their place and callings. Before his death he encreased his Church-reuenues to that height, that it did and was able to maintaine fifty Monkes, some say threescore. The yearely value of this Monastery at the suppression amounted to 486. l. 5. s. The donations to this Monastery were confirmed by Pope Vrban the second, in these words following.

Pontificatus nostri, Anno octauo. M ss. in bib. Cot. When as William the Conquerour built the great white square Tower of London, hee appointed this Bishop to bee principall Surueyor of that worke: who was for that time lodged in the house of one Edmere a Bur∣gesse of London: as it is in the booke of the Bishops of Rochester in these words. Gundulphus Episcopus mandato Willelmi Regis magni presuit operi mag∣ne Turris London, quo tempore hospitatus est apud quendam Edmerum Bar∣gensem London. The Hospitall of Chetham. This Bishop built a great part of the Castle of Rochester, namely, the great Tower which yet standeth. Hee founded an Hospitall in Chetham, which hee dedicated to the honour of Saint Bartholomew, for the reliefe of such people as were infected with the foule disease of the Leprosie: hee en∣dowed it with sufficient reuenues; which grant was confirmed by king Hen∣ry the third, and discharged of all taxes, and tallages, by King Ed. the third. Malling Ab∣bey. He founded the Abbey at Malling, which he consecrated to the blessed Virgine, and placed therein blacke Nunnes. Which Nunnery he gouerned himselfe during all his life time. And lying at the point of death, hee com∣mended it to the charge of one Auice, Lamb peramb. to whom notwithstanding he would not deliuer the Pastorall staffe, before shee had promised canonicall obedi∣ence, fidelitie, and subiection to the See of Rochester; and protested by oath, that there should neither Abbesse nor Nunne bee from thenceforth receiued into the house, without the consent and priuitie of him and his Successours. This Nunnery was valued at the suppression, at two hundred fourty fiue pounds, ten shillings two pence halfepeny of yearely reuenue. Ouer the Abbey gate yet standing, is the likenesse of a Pastorall staffe. This good Bishop dyed the seuenth of March, 1107. and was buried where you see the pourtraitures of certaine Bishops, sometimes artificially cut in stone and Alabaster, but now cut almost all in peeces, dismembred, and shame∣fully abused (as all other Monuments in this Church are, of any antiquity) so that neither reading, nor tradition can giue vs any true notice of their names. Gilbert de Glanuil (before mentioned) a gentleman of an ancient family, Gilbert de Glanvill Bishop of Rochester was consecrated to this Bishopricke, September 29. Ann. 1185. Betweene this man and his Monkes of Rochester was long and continuall debate; by occasion whereof, hee tooke away from them all their moueable goods, all the ornaments of their Church, their writings and euidences, yea and a great part of their lands, Godwin. possessions and priuiledges; wanting money to follow their suites against him, they were forced to coyne the siluer of Saint Paulinus Shryne into money. These controuersies were ended no other∣wise then by his death, which happened, Iune 24. 1214. hauing ruled his contentious charge 29. yeares. But the hatred of these Monkes against him was so dying with him, as they would afford him no manner of Obse∣quies, but buried him most obscurely, or rather basely, without either ring∣ing, singing, or any other solemnitie; and furthermore abused him with such like rime-doggerell. Glanvill Gilbert us nulla bonitate refertus Hic iacet immitis & amator maxime litis; Et quia sic litem, dum vixit, solet amare, Nunc vbi pax nulla est, est aptior inhabitare. These blacke Monkes (whom I thinke, if the matter were well exami∣ned, The Hospitall in Strowd. would proue to be in the fouler fault) were too malitious to remember that this Bishop founded S. Maries Hospitall at Strowd, neare adioyning to this Citie, called the New worke, and endowed it witha liuelihood of 52. l. of yearely profits, which it now enioyeth. Here lyeth entombed the body of Walter de Merton, Walterus Mer ton Bishop of Rochester. so surnamed of Merton, a village in Surrey, where he was borne, sometimes Lord Chan∣cellour of England, Bishop of this See, and Founder of Merton Colledge in Oxford: To whose memory Sir Henry Savill (that rare Grecian, Sir Hen. Sauill. and ex∣act reuiuer of Antiquities, now deceased) late Warden of the said Colledge, and Prouost of Eaton, with the fellowes of the same, taking downe an old marble Tombe, haue erected another Monument ouer him of Touch and Alabaster, bearing this Inscription.

Haymo de Heath, or Hythe, so named of Hithe, a Towne in this tract, where he was borne, lyeth buried by the North wall: he was Confessour to King Edward the second. This man built much at his Mannor houses of Troscliffe and Hawling. In the Towne of Hithe before named, he founded the Hospitall of Saint Bartholomew, S. Barthol. Hosp. in Hithe. for reliefe of ten poore people, endow∣ing the same with twenty Markes of yearely reuenue. He resigned his Bi∣shopricke into the Popes hands, of whom he had receiued consecration in the Court at Rome, In bib. Cott. Ann. 1352. and liued about some six yeares after that a priuate life with the Monkes in this Priory. This Bishop (saith the booke of Rochester) bought a precious Miter which was Thomas Beckets, of the Executours of the Bishop of Norwich, which hee offered at the high Altar, on S. Pauls day, 1327. Iohn de Shepey Bishop of Ro∣chester, Lord Treasurer. Iohn de Shepey, so likewise surnamed from the place of his birth, vpon Haymo his resignation, was by the Pope elected to this Bishoprick; hee was Lord Treasurer of England, in the two and thirtieth yeere of King Ed∣ward the third, in which office he continued about three yeeres, euen vn∣till his death, which happened the nineteenth of October, 1360. His portraiture is in the wall ouer his place of Buriall. Io. Lowe Bishop of Rochester. Here, ouer against Bishop Merton, lieth buried, vnder a faire Marble Tombe, the body of Iohn Lowe, Bishop of this Diocesse, borne in Wor∣cestershire, and brought vp in Oxford, where he proceeded Doctor of Di∣uinitie. He liued for a time in the Abbey of the Friers Augustines in Wor∣cester, Bale Cent. 4. of which order he was Prouinciall; Vir aetate sua ab omni parte do∣ctus : So that in regard of his great learning, and painfulnes in preaching, he was preferred first to the Bishoprick of Saint Asaph, Godwin. by King Henry the sixt, and after that translated to this of Rochester; hee writ diuers learned works, and was a carefull searcher after good bookes, so as diuers copies of some ancient Fathers had vtterly perished but for his diligence. Hee died the yeere 1467. hauing gouerned the See of Saint Asaph foure yeeres, and and this of Rochester foure and twenty. The inscription vpon his Tombe is almost all gone, only these words remayning, . . . . . . Iohannis Low Epis . . . . . . . . . . . . miserere mei Domine. Credo videre Dominum in terra viventium. O quam breve spatium huius mundi sicomp. . . . . Sic mundi gloria transit. Sancte Andree & Augustine, orate prop nobis. I doe not finde the certainty of any other of the Bishops of this Diocesse to haue bin buried in this Cathedrall Church; for most commonly in anci∣ent times, as now, they departed from this place, before they departed from the world, this Ecclesiasticall preferment being but a step to some higher aduancement. A word therefore or two of Saint William here en∣shrined, and the like of the Priory, and so I will take my leaue of this most ancient, and no lesse reuerend Episcopall Chaire; and goe to Gillingham; for the rest of the funerall Monuments in this Church, are of later times; which I reserue for another Volume. This Priory erected by Gundulph, and the number of her religious Vo∣taries, encreased by him from sixe secular Priests, Priory of Ro¦chester. to threescore blacke Ca∣nons or Monkes, with ample reuenues for their maintenance, was, within the compasse of one hundred yeares; what by casuall fire, what by the fall∣ing out of the Monkes, and Bishop Glanvill, and what by the calamities it sustained in the warres of King Iohn, brought to that ruine and pouerty, that the beauty of all her goodly buildings was altogether defaced, her Church burned, her sacred Vtensiles, by robbery and suites in law, embe∣zelled, mispent, and consumed, and the whole Couent greatly indebted. Anno, Lib. Rossen. in bib. Cott. 1179.3. Id. Aprilis Rofensis Ecclesia cum omnibus officinis, & cum tota vrbe infra & extra muros combusta est, anno 97. ex quo Monachi in ea∣dem Ecclesia instituti sunt. It was now therefore high time, saith Master Lambard, to deuise some way whereby this Priory and Church of Rochester, might be, if not alto∣gether, restored to the ancient wealth and estimation, yet at the least some∣what relieued from this penury, nakednesse, and abiection. Therefore Lau∣rence of Saint Martins, Bishop of this Church, and Councellour of King Henry the third, perceiuing the common people to bee somewhat drawne (by the fraud of the Monkes) to thinke reuerently of one William, Lamb. per amb. that lay buried in the Church, and knowing well, that there was no one way, so compendious to gaine, as the aduancement of a Pilgramage, procured at the Popes Court, the canonization of the said William, S. William of Rochester. with Indulgence to all such as would offer at his Tombe, vnderpropping by meanes of this new Saint, some manner of reuerend opinion of the Church, which before (through the defacing of the old Bishop Paulinus his Shrine) was declined to naught. This Saint William was by birth a Scot of Perthe, Neua Legenda Capgraui ▪ by trade of life a Ba∣ker of bread; in charitie so abundant, that hee gaue to the poore the tenth loafe of his workmanship, in zeale so feruent, that in vow he promised, and in deed attempted to visit the holy Land, and the places where Christ was conuersant on earth. In which iourney, as he passed through Kent, he made Rochester his way, where after that he had rested two or three dayes, he departed toward Canterbury, but ere he had gone farre from the Citie, his seruant that waited on him, led him (of purpose) out of the high-way, and spoyled him both of his money and life. This done, the seruant escaped, and the Master (because he dyed in so holy a purpose of minde) was by the Monkes conueyed hither to Saint Andrewes, laid in the Quire, and promo∣ted by the Pope, as you haue heard, from a poore Baker to a blessed Martyr. Here (as they say) he shewed miracles very plentifully, which made peo∣ple of all sorts offer vnto him wondrous liberally, euen vntill these latter times; insomuch, that with two yeares oblations at his Shrine, one William de Hoo, a Sacrist, or keeper of the holy treasures, of this Church, built the whole Quire as it now stands. Richard Walden a Monke and sacrist, Lib. Rossen, in bib. Cot. built the South Isle, Richard East∣gate, a Monke and Sacrist, began the North Isle of the new worke, towards Saint Williams gate, which Frier William de Axenham almost finished. Geffery de Hadenham Prior, payed thirteene hundred pounds in one day, to certaine creditours, to whom this Church stood indebted, since the time of her troubles, the same man bought certaine lands in Banerkin, and Darent, which he gaue to this House; and bequeathed to the same 300. l. in money vpon his decease. He built the Dorter in the Priory, and the Altar of Saint Edmund in the Church. To which, or rather to the high Altar, Haymo, Bishop of this Diocesse, offered vp a pretious Miter, which some∣time belonged to Archbishop Becket, and which hee bought of the Execu∣tours of Iohn Bishop of Norwich. Thus by the gaines of William, the Ba∣kers Shrine, and by the pious endeauours and bounteous donations of di∣uers well disposed persons, this Monastery was in short time reedified, ador∣ned, and aduanced to her former height, glory, wealth, and estimation. So that it was valued by the Commissioners of the late suppression, at foure hundred eightie sixe pounds, eleuen shillings, fiue pence, by yeare. Gillingham. In this Church are diuers faire Monuments fairely kept, of the Beaufits, an ancient family, whose chiefe seate was at Grauch-court within this Pa∣rish, as I was enformed. Io.

Which said Ioane deceased in the yeare of grace, 1431. Here was a pilgrimage to our Lady of Gillingham. Ailesford. The iery. Richard, Lord Grey of Codnor in Darbishire, in the yeare 1240. founded here a religious house of white Friers, Carmelites, where now is seene (saith Camden ) the faire habitation of Sir William Sidley, Com. in en . a learned knight, paine∣fully and expensfully studious of the common good of his countrey, as both his endowed house for the poore, The Almes∣house o Hos∣pitall. and the bridge here with the com∣mon voice dotestifie. Not farre from this Towne of Ailesford, lye interred the bodies of Ca∣tigern and Horsa ; Catigern and Horsa. who hand to hand, killed one the other in a set battell; Catigern was the brother of Vortimer king of the Britaines, and Horsa bro∣ther of Hengist the Saxon. But this battell, as also their buriall, are the best set downe by Camden, out of Lambards perambulation. This Towne (saith hee) was named in the British tongue, Saissenaeg haibail of the Saxons there vanquished, like as others in the very same sense tearmed it Anglesford. For Guortimer the Britaine, The battell of Ailesford. Guortigerus sonne, did here set vpon Hengist, and the English Sax∣ons, whom being disrayed, and not able to abide a second charge, he put all to flight; so as they had beene vtterly defeited for euer, but that Hengist, skilfull and prouident to preuent, and diuert danger, withdrew himselfe in∣to the Isle of Tenet, vntill that the inuincible vigour and heate of the Bri∣tanes was allayed, and fresh supplies came to his succour out of Germany. In this battell were slaine the Generalls of both sides, Catigern the Britaine, and Horsa the Saxon, of whom the one buried at Horsted, Horsted. not farre from hence, gaue name to the place: and Catigern honoured with a stately and so∣lemne funerall, is thought to haue beene interred neare vnto Ailisford, where vnder the side of an hill, Catigern his se∣pulchre. I saw foure huge, rude, hard stones erected, two for the sides, one transuersall in the middest betweene them; and the hugest of all piled and layed ouer them, in manner of the British Monu∣ment, which is called Stonehenge, but not so artificially with Mortis and tenents. Verily the vnskilfull common people call it at this day, of the same Catigern, Keiths or Kits, Coty house. The like Monument was of Horsa at Horsted, which stormes and time haue now deuoured.

But these Canons did not continue long at Otteham, the scituation of the place being vnfitting, and very chargeable for so many liuing together in a Couent; whereupon by the said Ela, daughter and heire of the said Raph Dene, and as then the widow of Iordan de Sackvile (one of the An∣cestors of that right honourable and no lesse ancient family of the Sackviles, Earles of Dorset) they were remoued to Begam, a village in the South-west Verge of this County adioyning to Sussex: such was the Charter for their remouall.

Sir Thomas Sackuile knight, Sir Tho.

Here in this Church vnder a marble Monument, Sir Stephen Pensherst knight. whereon is yet to be seene the pourtraiture of a knight compleatly armed, lyeth interred (as it is deliuered vnto me by tradition) the body of Sir Stephen Pensherst, or Stephen de Penchester, (for so also I finde him called) that famous Lord Warden of the Fiue Ports, who flourished in the raigne of King Edward the first, as appeares by this Record following.

Here lye also interred diuers of that ancient and highly renowned Fa∣milie of the Sidneys, Sidney▪ whose Monuments of any great antiquitie, together with their Inscriptions, are worne away with time. Who deriue their race from William de Sidney, Chamberlaine to king Henry the second. Out of which came (saith Camden ) Sir Henry Sidney, amd in Ken . that renowned Lord Deputy of Ireland, who of the daughter of Iohn Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, and Earle of Warwicke, begat Philip and Robert, whom our late Soue∣raigne Lord King Iames created Baron Sidney of Penshert, Viscount Lisle, and Earle of Leicester. And to giue more lustre to these foresaid honours, he was elected knight and companion of the honourable Order of the Garter, at an extraordinarie Chapter holden at Greenwich, the day of May, Ann. 1616. and enstalled at Windsor the seuenth of Iuly next follow∣ing. This Earle dyed the day of .... Ann. Sir Philip Sid∣ney knight. But here I cannot passe ouer in silence Sir Philip Sidney the elder brother, being (to vse Camdens words) the glorious starre of this family, a liuely pat∣terne of vertue, and the louely ioy of all the learned sort, fighting valiantly with the enemy before Zutphen in Gelderland, dyed manfully. This is that Sidney, whom, as Gods will was, he should be therefore borne into the world, euen to shew vnto our age a sample of ancient vertues: so his good pleasure was, before any man looked for it, to call for him againe, and take him out of the world, as being more worthy of heauen then earth. Thus we may see, perfect vertue suddenly vanisheth out of sight, and the best men continue not long. Seigneur Des Accords in his booke entituled, Les Bigarrures (a miscella∣nie or hotch-potch of sundry collections) amongst many choice Epitaphs, hath one, selected out of the works of Isaac du Bellay, the French Poet, ex∣cellently composed, to the memory of Sieur de Boniuet, a great Comman∣der in the warres; which by some English wit was happily imitated, and ingeniously applyed to the honour of this our worthy chiefetaine Sir Phi∣lip ; written vpon a Tablet, and fastened to a pillar in S. Pauls Church Lon∣don, the place of his buriall, as the sequele will more plainly shew. The Epitaph for Mons. Bo∣niuet: La France, et le Piemont, les cieux, et les Arts, Les Soldats, et le Mondeont fait comme six parts, De ce grand Bonniuet: cor vne si grand chose, Dedant vn seul tombeau ne pouuoit estre enclose. La France en a le corps, que elle aurit esleue: Le Piemont a le ceur, qu'il auoit esprouue: Les cieux en ont l'esprit, et les Arts la memoire, Les Soldats le regret, et le monde la gloire. In English as followeth. France, and Piemont, the Heauens, and the Arts, The Souldiers and the world haue made sixe parts, Of Great Bonniuet : for who will suppose, That onely one Tombe can this man enclose? France hath his body, which she bred and well loued, Piemont his heart, which his valour had proued. The Heauens haue his soule, the Arts haue his Fame, The Souldiers the griefe, the world his good name. A briefe Epitaph vpon the death of that most valiant, and perfect hono∣rable Gentleman, Sir Philip Sidney, knight, late Gouernour of Flushing in Zealand, who receiued his deaths wound at a battell neare Zutphen in Gel∣derland, the 22. day of September, and dyed at Arnhem the 16. day of October, 86. Whose Funeralls were performed, and his body interred, within this Cathedrall Church of Saint Paul in London, the 16. day of February next following in the yeare of our Lord God, 1586. England, . Netherland, the Heauens, and the Arts, The Souldiers and the world haue made sixe parts, Of noble Sidney : For who will suppose, That a small heape of stones can Sidney enclose? England hath his body, for she it fed, Netherland his bloud in her defence shed: The Heauens haue his soule, the Arts haue his Fame, The Souldiers the griefe, the world his good Name. These Elegies also following, penned in the praise of the said Philip, by our late Soueraigne Lord King Iames, that sole Monarch of many Nations, giue a glorious lustre to his Heroicke actions.

In this ruinous Church, which (like the Ca tle) carries with it a shew of venerable antiquitie, I finde no funerall Monument of elder times re∣markable; in the north window onely are depicted the pourtraitures of the Lord Hugh Stafford, kneeling in his coate-armour, and his Bow-bearer Thomas Bradlaine by him, with this inscription.

This Hugh dyed the tenth of No∣uember 1347. Ann. 21. Ed. 3. I finde little of him remarkable, saue his good fortunes, Vincent Disco∣uery of errors. being a younger brother to marry so great an inheritrix, and to be exalted to such titles of honour. His wife Margaret (first married to Pierce Gaueston Earle of Cornwall) dyed before him in the yeare of our Lord, 1342. the 13. day of Aprill. They were both together sumptuously entombed by Margaret their daughter, the onely heire of her parents, wife to Raph de Stafford, Earle of Stafford. The said Raph de Stafford and Margaret his wife, Raph Earle of Stafford, and Margaret his wife. were here likewise en∣tombed, at the feet of their father and mother; this Raph, by the marriage of his wife Margaret, writ himselfe in his Charters and deeds, Baron of Tunbridge.

About the latter end of the raigne of king Edward the third (to vse M. Lambards words) there was found, lying in the streets of Sennocke, a poore childe, whose parents were vnknowne, and he for the same cause na∣med after the place where he was taken vp, William Sennock. This orphan was, by the helpe of some charitable persons, brought vp and nourtured in such wise, that being made an Apprentice to a Grocer in London, he arose by degrees, in course of time, to bee Maior, and chiefe Magistrate of that Citie. At which time, calling to his minde the goodnesse of Almighty God, and the fauour of the Townesmen extended towards him, he determined to make an euerlasting Monument of his thankfull minde for the same; and therefore in the yeare 1418. the yeare of his Maioroialtie, hee builded both an Hospitall for reliefe of the poore; and a free-Schoole for the education of youth within this Towne, endowing both the one and the other with competent yearely liuing (as the dayes then suffered) towards their susten∣tation and maintenance. But since his time the Schoole was much amend∣ed by the liberalitie of one Iohn Potkyn, which liued vnder the reigne of king Henry the eighth, and now lately also in the raigne of Queene Eliza∣beth of famous memory, through the honest trauell of diuers Towne-in∣habitants; not onely the yearely stipend is much increased, and the former litigious possessions quietly established, but the Corporation also changed into the name of two Wardeins, and foure Assistants of the free-Schoole of Queene Elizabeth in Sennocke.

For which and other his rare parts, he was much admired, and became very famous. The Pope made him his Peniten∣ciarie, and bestowed vpon him this Bishopricke of Rochester; he being be∣fore a Benedictine Monke of Norwich. He was Confessour vnto king Ric. the second; and a singular Benefactour he was to the English Hospitall at Rome. He dyed as before, Ann. 1389.

And shee likewise (howsoeuer she had many husbands) (of which number Sir Iohn Oldcastle was one) had not any issue, Sir Iohn Old∣castle knight Lord Cobham. but onely by Sir Reygnold Braybroke, who dyed all young, excepting one daughter called Ioane ; who married with Thomas Brooke of Somersetshire, to whom she brought both her mothers inheritance and ho∣nour; which these Brookes did happily enioy for the space of sixe descents, being euer employed in offices of State, and matters of high consequence. Yet alwayes standing firme, both in the fauour of the Prince, and his people, vntill the last of these Lords, stumbling vpon a shallow-pated Treason, which was laid in his way; fell downe to the ground, together with his house, his inheritance, and all his additions of honour.

King Edward the third founded here a goodly faire Monastery, about the yeare of his raigne of England, the thirtieth, and of France the seuen∣teenth: In which he placed women, religious Votaries, or white Nunnes. Which Nunnery at the generall dissolution, was found to bee well worth three hundred and eightie pounds by yeare. This Priory (for so it was cal∣led by the Founder) was taken (as all the rest) into the hands of king Hen∣ry the eight: of which he made a fit dwelling place for himselfe, and his Successours, which remaines to this day, howsoeuer somewhat ruinous. But will it please you peruse this Memorandum, not impertinent to this matter, in the visitation of Kent, and Sussex, made by Clarentieux Beuolt, the 21. yeare of king Henry the eight, Dame Elizabeth Cresner being Lady Prioresse of Dartford at that time.

In the yeare of our Lord 1178. the third of the Ides of Iune, Richard Lucie a Councellour of State, and chiefe Iustice of the Realme, began the foundation of an Abbey, Ric. de Lucie the founder. at Lesnes or Westwood, neare vnto this Towne of E th The extent of whose yearely reuenue (as it was prized by the Com∣missioners at the suppression) amounted to one hundred eighty sixe pounds and nine shillings. When this his goodly fabricke was in all parts finished, he presently forsooke and surrendred into the kings hands, R g Heu den. An. 1179. all both his of∣fices and honours; And betooke himselfe to the habite and profession of a Canon Regular in this house of his owne foundation; where, within a short while after, euen in the same yeare, to wit, the fourteenth of Iuly, 1479. he exchanged his Conuentuall blacke coole, for a glorious bright heauenly crowne. And here in the Quire of his Church hee was sumptuously entombed, vpon whose Monument this Epitaph was engrauen. Ex vet. Mss. in o Cot.

Now giue me leaue to go a little further with him and his heires, as I finde the words in the Collection of Englands Protectours, by Francis Thinne Lancaster Herald. Sir Richard Lucie knight, chiefe Iustice of England (saith he) was Pro∣tectour of England in the twelfth yeare of the raigne of king Henry the se∣cond, in the absence of the king, when hee was in Normandie, and in the parts beyond the Seas. Which Lucie in the thirteenth yeare of the same King, did valiantly resist, and politikely driue backe the Earle of Bolloigne, inuading this kingdome. He built the Abbey of Leosnes or Westwood in the Parish of Erith in Kent (and not in Southfleet as some haue written) in the yeare of Christ, 1178. and the Castle of Chipping Augre in Essex. He had issue Godfrey, Bishop of Winchester, and three daughters; who, after the death of Godfrey their brother, were his heires▪ Maude the eldest daugh∣ter was married to Robert the first, called Fitzwater. Aueline the second daughter was married to Richard Riuers of Stanford Riuers in Essex. Rose the third daughter was married to Richard de Warren, the naturall sonne of king Iohn : as appeareth by a deed (belonging to my selfe, who had the Rectory of Leosnes) beginning thus. Rosa de Douer quondam vxor vene∣rabilis viri Richardi filij Regis de Chillam. And king Iohn by his Charter grants to another Rose her grandfathers lands, in these words: Rex reddi∣dit Roesie de Douerita totam terram suam cum pertenenc. qua eam contin∣git de heredit. Richardi de Lucy avi sui tenend. sibi & hered. &c. Cart. 24. Reg. Iohannis, numero 37. in Archi. Turris London. The foresaid Godfrey de Lucy was consecrated Bishop of Winchester, Godfrey Lucy Bishop of Win∣chester. the first of Nouember 1189. And died Ann. 1204 hauing gouerned that See fifteene yeares. He purchased of king Richard the first, the Mannors of Wergraue, and Menes, which in times past had belonged to his Bishop∣ricke: he was a great Benefactour to this Religious house of Leosnes, foun∣ded by his father; wherein according to his will hee was enterred. To whose memory this Epitaph was engrauen vpon his Tombe. Lux mea lux Christi, si terre ventre quiesco Attamen in celo sanctorum luce lucesco.

Iohn Norbury founded a Priory in this Towne of Lewsham, which hee replenished with blacke Monkes Aliens, belonging to the Abbey of Gaunt in Flanders, Priors Aliens. and thereupon called Aliens, because they were Celles to some Monastery or other beyond the Seas. The first foundation of these houses I do not finde; but in the raigne of king Edward the third, they were en∣creased to the number of one hundred and ten in England, besides them in Ireland, Their goods and lands consiscate. King Edward surnamed Long∣shanks did the like, An. Reg. 3. vpon the like occasion. Aquitane, and Normandy. The goods of all which Priories, the said king Ann. Reg. 12. (because of his warres with France) caused to be confiscated to his owne vse, letting out their houses to farme, with all their lands and tenements, for the space of three and twenty yeares. At the end of which Terme (Peace being concluded betweene the two Nations) he restored to the Priors Aliens their houses, lands, and tenements, Ann. Reg. 35. as by his patents may appeare in effect as followeth. Edward by the grace of God King of England, Restitution of the Aliens. Lord of Ireland, and of Aquitaine, to all by these presents, &c. Although the Priory of Monta∣cute in the County of Somerset (by reason of the warres betweene vs and France) with all the lands, St w Annal. tenements, fees, aduowsons, together with the goods and cattels belonging to the same, hath beene of late taken into our hands, and by vs farmed and rented forth, as appeareth by diuers patents; Now therefore, since peace is betwixt vs, and the noble Prince, our most deare brother the king of France, we, for the honour of God, and holy Church, restore to the said Prior, the Priory with all the lands, tenements, fees, aduowsons, and whatsoeuer else belonging to the same, to hold the same in as free manner as they held it before. And withall, forgiue and re∣lease all arrerages of Rents, which might bee due vnto vs by reason of any former grants. In witnesse, &c. the sixth of February, the 35. yeare of our raigne. The like letters of restitution all the rest of the houses of Aliens had through England; The finall dis∣solu of P ∣ories Aliens all which were cleane suppressed, and vtterly dissolued by king Henry the fifth, and their lands giuen by him and his sonne Henry the sixth, to Colledges of learned men, and to other Monasteries. Greenwich. This Parish Church is consecrated to the honour of Saint Aelphege, Aelphege Arch∣bishop of Can∣terbury. sometime Archbishop of Canterbury, who suffered martyrdome much-what about the same place where it now standeth. Which Aelp ege (bo ne of great parentage, brought vp in good learning, preferred first to the Bi∣shopricke of Winchester, then to this of Canterbury; a man admired for his strict manner of life, and holy exhortations, by both which hee con uerted many vnto Christ) was cruelly put to death by the Danish Pagans, with many exquisite torments, in the yeare of our Lord, a thousand and twelue. Of which, in William Malmesbury, Camden, and the Catalogue of Bishops, you may reade more at large. It was long before these bloudy exe∣cutioners would suffer his bodie to bee committed to the earth, after the manner of Christian decencie; yet at length that fauour was obtained, and his body here first buried; from whence within a short time after, his re∣liques were remoued to Saint Pauls London, and from thence (at the commandement of king Knute ) to Canterbury. He was canonized; and the 19. day of Aprill allowed for celebration of his memory. Some write, Ca graut in vita Elphege. Ditma . Mar . that like another Stephen, he was stoned to death, that like him he prayed for his enemies; and that Turkill (generall of those Danes) was conuerted to the faith, at the sight of his constant martyrdome. Here sometime stood an house of obseruant Friers, The Friery a Greenwich. which came hither about the latter end of the raigne of King Edward the fourth, at whose hands they obtained a Chantrie, with a little Chappell of the holy Crosse, a place yet extant in the Towne; Lamb. peramb. and king Henry the seuenth builded for them an house adioyning to the Pallace, which is there yet to be seene. Here in this Towne was another Monastery of Friers Minorites, The Priory. and Aliens, founded by King Edward the third, and the foresaid Iohn Norbury : which as Lewsham did, belonged to the Abbot of Gaunt in Flaunders, vn∣till such time as King Henry the fifth (seising into his hands (by occasion of warre) all the lands of the Priors Aliens) (as I haue touched before) be∣stowed this, together with the Mannor of Lewsham, and many other lands also, vpon the Priory of Chartrehouse Monkes of Shene, which hee had then newly erected; to which it remayned, vntill the time of the raigne of king Henry the eight, who annexed it to the Crowne.

Pontificatus nostri, Ann. primo. By another Bull dated the same yeare, and his Apostolicall authoritie, he giues them free election of their Confessour the Priest. Their Priest & Confessour. The words are; Ali∣quem ydoneum et discretum presbyterum eligere confessorem indulgemus, qui quotiens vobis fuerit oportunum confessionibus vestris diligenter auditis, pro commissis debitam vobis absolutionem impendat et iniungat penitentiam salutarem; nisi forsan talia fuerint, &c. propter que sedes Apostolica, &c.

We fauourably yeeld to your deuout and pious supplications, and we giue you leaue to choose a sufficient and discreete Priest for your Confessor; who so often, as to you it shall be thought conuenient, your confessions be∣ing attentiuely heard, may giue to each of you due absolution for your de∣linquencies committed, And appoint you sauing and comfortable penance: vnlesse the offences be of that nature, for which the Apostolicall chaire is to be sought to for remission. Therefore let it not be lawfull for any man, in any wise, to infringe, or in a kind of foole-hardinesse rashly to contradict this Cartulary of our Concession: which indeed if any one presume to attempt, let him know for certaine, that he shall incurre the indignation of Almighty God, and of his blessed Apostles Peter and Paul. Giuen, &c. Then followes a forme of Absolution, made in the Apostolicall Con∣sistory with plenary Indulgence to be pronounced by the Priest, to any one of these Merchants whensoeuer they shall bee dangerously sicke, in these words, Ego authoritate Dei omnipotentis & beatorum Petri et Pauli Apostolorum eius, The forme of an Absolution. et Domini nostri Martini Pape Quinti mihi in hac parte specialiter commissa, secundum quod potestas mihi tradita se extendit, et quantum de∣beo et possum si ista vice moriaris te absolvo ab omnibus penis Purgatorii, que tibi in Purgatorio debentur propter culpas et offensas quas contra Deum commisisti; et te restituo illi innocentie in qua eras tempore quo baptizatus fuisti.

He is properly called a Marchant, qui mare traijcit, The definition of a Merchant who passeth ouer the Seas, et merces inde avehit, and from thence transports merchandise or wares into his owne warehouse; either bought for ready money, or had in exchange for other commodities which hee brings with him out of his owne Country. The diligence and industry of these Marchants is accurat∣ly expressed by Horace, Epist. lib. 1. Ep. 1. Impiger extremos curret Mercator ad Indos Per mare pauperiem fugiens, per saxa, per ignes. The ready Merchant runs to th'utmost Inde with speed. By Sea, by rocks, by fire, to shun outragious need. There are a company of notable Skanderouns which greatly desire to be stiled Merchants, and these are such as runne from house to house, from Market to Market, What Pedlers are. such as haunt Faires and all publicke meetings; with packs and Fardels vpon their backes, filled with counterfeit and adulterate wares, with which they cheat, deceiue, and cosin the poore countrey-peo∣ple: and these are called Pedlers, Quod pedes iter conficiunt: because they go on foot. Stapula inquit (Lud. Guiccia, est locus publicus quo principis auctoritate et priuilegio, Staple whar . lanae, vina, coria, frumenta, aliaeque merces exotica vendendi causa conuchuntur. Staple is a publicke place (saith Lud. Guiccia ) to which by the Prince his authoritie and priuiledge, wooll, wine, Hides of beasts, corne or graine, and other exoticke or forraine merchandise are transferred, carried, or conueyed there to be sold, or set to sale. Or, Staple signifieth this or that Towne or Citie, whither the Merchants of England, by common order or commandement, did carry their woolls, wooll-fels, clothes, lead, and Tinne, and such like commodities of our Land, for the vtterance of them by the great. The word (saith Mins. let. 5.) may probably bee taken two wayes, one from Stapel, which in the Saxon or old English language, signifieth the stay or hold of any thing. Or from the French word Estape, id est, forum Vinarium : because to those places, whither our English Merchants brought their commodities, the French would also meete them with theirs, which most of all consisteth in wines. Now, howsoeuer we most commonly finde the Staple to bee kept, and thereupon, as in this place, the Merchants thereof were stiled, Mercatores Stapulae villae Calistiae, yet you may read of many other places appointed for the Staple in the Statutes of the Land, according as the Prince by his coun∣sell thought good to alter them from the second yeare of Edward the third, cap 9. to the fifth of Edward the sixth. Officers belonging to these Staples, were Maiors, Constables, Maniper∣nors, correctours, Porters, packers, winders, workers, and other labourers of woolls. The Fees of the Maiors and Constables of the Staples in England, leuied out of 4. d. a Sacke of wooll, comming to euery Staple, were as followeth. The Maior of the Staple of Westminster had yearly, one hundred pounds, and euery of the Constables there ten markes. The Maiors of the Staples of Yorke, Kingstone vpon Hull, Norwich, and Winchester, euery of them twenty pounds, and euery of the Constables of the same places one hun∣dred shillings. The Maiors of Newcastle vpon Tine, Chichester, and of Exceter, ten pounds; and euery of the Constables of those places fiue markes. And if any of the Maiors and Constables aboue named, refused the Office, hee was to pay to the company as much as his Fee should amount to. Of all which you may reade the Statute, Ann. 27. Ed. 3. The Maior and Constables of the Staple had power to record Recogni∣sances of debt taken before them, by vertue of a Statute, made the tenth of Henry the sixth. Chetham. And here giue me leaue (curteous Reader) to turne backe to this Church situate neare Rochester, onely to set downe a strange buriall in this Church∣yard, thus related by Lambard in his perambulation of Kent. Although (saith he) I haue not hitherto, at any time, reade any memo∣rable thing recorded in History, touching Chetham it selfe, yet, for so much as I haue often heard (and that constantly reported) a Popish illusion done at that place; and for that also it is as profitable to the keeping vnder of fai∣ned and superstitious religion, to renew to minde the Priestly practises of old time (which are declining to obliuion) as it is pleasant to retaine in memory the monuments and Antiquities of whatsoeuer of other kinde: I thinke it not amisse, to commit faithfully to writing, what I haue receiued credibly by hearing, concerning the Idols, sometime knowne by the names of our Lady, and the Roode of Chetham and Gillingham. It happened (say they) that the dead corps of a man (lost through shipwracke belike) was cast on land in the Parish of Chetham, & being there taken vp, was by some charitable persons committed to honest buriall within their Church∣yard: which thing was no sooner done, but our Lady of Chetham finding her selfe offended therewith, arose by night, and went in person to the house of the Parish-Clerk (which then was in the street, a good distance from the Church) and making a noise at his window, awaked him. This man at the first (as commonly it fareth with men disturbed in their rest) demanded, somewhat roughly, who was there: But when he vnderstood by her owne answer, that it was the Lady of Chetham, he changed his note, and most mildly asked the cause of her comming. She told him, that there was late∣ly buried neare to the place where she was honoured, a sinfull person, which so offended her eye with his gastly grinning, that, vnlesse he were remoued, she could not, but (to the great griefe of good people) withdraw her selfe from that place, and cease her wonted miraculous working in that place amongst them. And therefore she willed him to go with her, to the end that (by his helpe) she might take him vp and cast him againe into the Riuer. The Clerke obeyed, arose and waited on her toward the Church: but the good Lady (not wonted to walke) waxed weary of the labour, and there∣fore was enforced, for very want of breath, to sit downe in a bush by the way, and there to rest her. And this place (forsooth) as also the whole track of their iourney (remaining euer after a greene path) the Towne-dwellers were wont to shew. Now after a while, they go forward againe, and com∣ming to the Churchyard, digged vp the body, and conueyed it to the wa∣ters side, where it was first found. This done, our Lady shranke againe into her Shrine, and the Clerke packed home to patch vp his broken sleepe, but the corps now eftsoones floated vp and downe the Riuer, as it did before. Which thing being at length espied by them of Gillingham, it was once more taken vp and buri∣ed in their Church-yard. But see what followed vpon it, not onely the Roode of Gillingham (say they) that a while before was busie in bestow∣ing miracles, was now depriued of all that his former vertue: but also the very earth and place, where this carcase was laid, did continually for euer after settle and sinke downeward. This tale receiued by tradition (saith my foresaid Author) from the El∣ders, was long since both commonly reported, and faithfully credited of the vulgar sort, which although haply you shall not at this day learne at euery mans mouth (the Image being now many yeares sithence defaced) yet many of the aged number remember it well, and in the time of darknes, Haec erat in toto notissima fabula mundo. Otford. Burialls at Otford. The fields about this Village are filled with the dead bodies of many braue Souldiers, here slaine in two famous set battels: whereof the one happened amongst the Saxons themselues, contending for glory and su∣preme Soueraigntie. The other betweene the Danes and Saxons, striuing for lands, liues, and libertie. In the first Offa the king of Mercia (hauing al∣ready ioyned to his Dominion the most part of Westsex, and Northum∣berland, and seeking to haue added Kent also) preuailed against the Inha∣bitants of this countrey, not without great slaughter of his owne subiects. Alrick the king of Kent was here slaine by the hands of Offa himselfe. Whose ouerthrow was the lesse dishonourable, for that hee had the cou∣rage to withstand in single opposition, Alrick king of Kent. so puissant and impugnable an ene∣my. This Alrick was the last Kentish king that held the Scepter in a lineall succession; the rest that followed, both got and enioyed it by tyranny and vsurpation. Hee is said to haue raigned 34. yeares; and to haue beene thus vanquished in the yeare of Grace, 793. The place of his buriall, whether here with his discom ited souldiers, or at Canterbury with his royall An∣cestours, is to me vncertaine. In the second battell, Edmund the Monarch of the Englishmen (surna∣med for his great strength Ironside ) obtained against Canutus the Dane, a most honourable victory, committing vpon the Danes such slaughter, and bloudy hauocke, that if they had not better trusted to their heeles then to their hands (flying toward the Isle of Shepey) hee had that day made an end of the whole Danish armie: and by all likelihood the warres had ceased betwixt those two Nations for euer. In this battell Canute lost foure thou∣sand and fiue hundred men; and king Edmund onely six hundred. It was fought in the yeare, 1016. Bartilmew the Saint at Ot∣f rd and his offering. One Bartilmew (saith Lambard ) a Saint, was holden in great veneration at this Towne of Otford. His feast day was kept solemnly here, both with a faire and good fare, euer vpon Saint Bartholomewes day: he was much fre∣quented (by the Parishioners and neighbours about) for a most rare and singular propertie that he professed. For the manner was, that if any wo∣man (conceiued with childe) desired to bring forth a male, she should offer to Saint Bartilmew a cocke-chicken: and if her wish were to be deliuered of a female, she should then present him with a Hen. This Saint questionlesse was a good Purueyor of Poultrie for the Parson of the Towne. Saint Thomas Becket likewise was holden in great esteeme and worship at this Towne; for it was said of the Inhabitants long since, and may be as yet (perhaps) by some of them beleeued, that while Thomas Becket lay at the old House here at Otford (which of long time belonged to the Archbishops of Canterbury, A part of Saint Tho Beckets . and whereof some part is as yet remaining) and say that it wanted a fit spring to water it: that hee strake his staffe into the dry ground (in a place thereof at this day called Saint Thomas Well) and that immediately water appeared; the which running plentifully ser∣ueth the Offices of the new House at this present time. They say also that as he walked on a time in the old Parke (busie at his prayers) that he was much hindered in his deuotion, by the sweet note and melodie of a Nightingale, that sang in a Bush besides him, and that there∣fore (in the might of his holinesse) he inioyned that from thenceforth no bird of that kinde should be so bold as to sing thereabouts. Some men re∣port likewise, that for as much as a Smith (then dwelling in the Towne) had prickt his horse in the shooting; he enacted by like authoritie, that af∣ter that time no Smith should thriue within the Parish. But I exspatiate too farre, and desire a fauourable construction. Not farre from Otford, Burials in Holmes Dal in the same valley, called Holmes Dale (that is to say, the Dale betweene the wooddie hills) many expert worthy Com∣manders, and valiant common souldiers lie interred: For here the people of Kent being encouraged by the prosperous successe of Edward their king (the sonne of Aelfred, and commonly surnamed the Elder) assemb ed themselues, and gaue to the Danes, that had many yeares before afflicted them, a most sharpe and fierce encounter, in the which after long fight they preuailed, and the Danes were ouerthrowne and vanquished, in the yeare of Grace, 904. This victory (saith Lambard ) and the like euent in another battell giuen to the Danes at Otford, which also stands in the same valley, begat, as I gesse, the common by-word, vsed amongst the inhabitants of this vale euen till this present day, in which they vaunt after this manner. The Vale of Holmesdale, Neuer wonne, ne neuer shall. These and many other victories atchieued by the valour of these Ken¦tish Inhabitants, giues me occasion to speake somewhat in generall of this flourishing countrey; and first I will begin with a late writer. To Canterbury then as kindly he resorts, His famous countrey thus he gloriously reports. O noble Kent, M. Drayton. Polyol. Song 18. quoth he, this praise doth thee belong, The hard'st to be controld, impatientest of wrong. Who, when the Norman first with pride and horrour sway'd, Threw'st off the seruile yoke vpon the English lay'd; And with a high resolue, most brauely didst restore, That libertie so long enioy'd by thee before. Not suffering forraine Lawes should thy free customes binde, Then onely showd'st thy selfe of th'ancient Saxon kinde. Of all the English Shires be thou surnamd the free, And formost euer plac't, when they shall reckoned bee. And let this Towne, which chiefe of thy rich countrey is, Of all the British Sees be still Metropolis. Of their throwing off the Norman yoke, his learned Illustrator Selden thus speakes. To explaine it, saith he, I thus English you a fragment of an old Monke: When the Norman Conquerour had the day, hee came to Douer Castle, that he might with the same subdue Kent also; wherefore Stigand, Arch∣bishop, and Egelsin Abbot, as the chiefe of the Shire; obseruing that now whereas heretofore no Villeins (the Latine is, Nullus fuerat seruus, and ap∣plying it to our Law phrase I translate it) had beene in England, they should bee now all in bondage to the Normans, they assembled all the County, and shewed the eminent dangers, the insolence of the Normans, and the hard condition of Villenage: they resoluing all rather to die then lose their freedome, purpose to encounter with the Duke for their coun∣tries liberties. Their Captaines are the Archbishop and the Abbot. Vpon an appointed day they meete all at Swanescombe, and harbouring them∣selues in the woods, with Boughs in euery mans hand, they incompasse his way. The next day, the Duke comming by Swanescombe, seemed to see with amazement, as it were a wood approaching towards him; the Kentish men at the sound of a Trumpet take themselues to Armes, when presently the Archbishop and Abbot were sent to the Duke, and saluted him with these words: Behold, Sir Duke, the Kentish come to meete you, willing to receiue you as their Liege Lord, vpon that condition, that they may for e er enioy their ancient Liberties and Lawes vsed among their Ancestors; otherwise, presently offering warre; being ready rather to die, then vnder∣go a voke of bondage, and loose their ancient Lawes▪ The Norman in this narrow pinch, not so willingly, as wisely, granted the desire: and hostages giuen on both sides, the Kentishmen direct the Normans to Rochester, and deliuer them the County and the Castle of Douer. Io. Sari r. de Nugis Curial. li. 6 ca 18. Againe for this honour of the Kentish in hauing the foremost place in euery battell, he deliuers thus much out of an old Author, who writ in La∣tine about the time of Henry the second. Which by him is likewise thus taught to speake English What performance king Cnut did among the Danes, and Norwegians by English valour, is apparant in that vntill this day, the Kentish men for their singular vertue then showne, haue prerogatiue alwayes to bee in the Vantgard: as Wiltshire, Deuonshire, and Cornwall in the Rere. Camd. in Kent. And further for the prowesse of the Kentish men, will it please you reade a peece out of Camden, the like in effect as before. The same commendation of ciuilitie and curtesie (saith he) which Caesar in old time gaue the Inhabitants of Kent, is yet of right due vnto them: that I may not speake of their warlike prowesse, whereas a certaine Monke hath written; How the Kentishmen so farre excelled, that when our armies are ready to ioyne battell, they of all Englishmen, are worthily placed in the front, as being reputed the most valiant and resolute souldiers. Which Iohn of Salisbury verifieth also in his Polycraticon. For good desert (saith he) of that notable valour, which Kent shewed so puissantly, and patiently against the Danes, it retaineth still vnto these dayes, in all battels, the ho∣nour of the first and fore-ward, yea and of the first conflict with the enemy. In praise of whom William of Malmesbury hath likewise written thus. The countrey people and Towne-dwellers of Kent, aboue all Englishmen re∣taine still the resent of their ancient worthinesse. And as they are more for∣ward, and readier to giue honour and entertainment to others, so they are more slow to take reuenge vpon others. Lambard in his perambulation speaking of the Estate of Kent, saith, The people of this countrey consisteth chiefly (as in other countries also) of the Gentrie and the Yeomanrie, of which the first be, for the most part, Gouer∣nors, and the other altogether gouerned: whose possessions also were at the first distinguished, by the names of Knights fee, and Gauelkinde: that for∣mer being proper to the warriour, and this latter to the husbandman. But these tenures long since haue beene so indifferently mixed and confounded in the hands of each sort, that there is not now any note of difference to be gathered by them. The reuenues of the Gentrie are greater here then any where else, The Gentrie of Kent. which thing groweth not so much by the quantitie of their possession, or by the fertilitie of their soile, as by the benefit of the situation of the countrey it selfe. Which hath all that good neighbourhood, that Marc. Cato, and other old Authors in husbandrie, require in a well placed Graunge, that is to say, the Sea, the Riuer, a populous Citie, and a well traded high-way, by the commodities whereof, the superfluous fruites of the ground be dearely sold, and consequently the land may yeeld a greater rent. These Gentlemen bee all (for the most part) acquainted with good let∣ters, and especially trained in the knowledge of the Lawes: They vse to manure some large portion of their territories, as well for the maintenance of their families, as also for their better increase in wealth. So that they be well employed, both in the publique seruice, and in their owne particular, and do vse hawking, hunting, and other disports, rather for their recrea∣tion, then for an occupation or pastime. The Yeomanrie or common people (for so they be called of the Saxon word gemen, The Yeomanry of Kent. which signifieth common) is no where more free and iolly then in this Shire: for besides that they themselues say in a clayme (made by them in the time of king Edward the first) that the Communaltie of Kent was neuer vanquished by the Conquerour, but yeelded it selfe by composition: And besides Geruasius Dorobernens. (or Geruis a Monke in Canterbury, who flourished in the raigne of king Henry the first) affirmeth that the fore-ward in all battels belongeth to them (by a certaine prehemi∣nence) in right of their manhood. And it is agreed by all men, that there were neuer any bondmen (or villaines as the law calleth them) in Kent. Neither bee they here so much bounden to the Gentrie by Copyhold, or customarie tenures, as the Inhabitants of the westerne Countries of the Realme be, nor at all indangered by the feeble hold of Tenant Right, (which is but a descent of a tenancie at will) as the Common people in the Northerne parts be: for Copyhold tenure is rare in Kent, and Tenant Right not heard of at all. But in place of these, the custome of Gauelkinde, (that is, Giue all Kinne) preuailing euery where, in manner euery man is a Free-holder, and hath some part of his owne to liue vpon. And in this their estate, they please themselues, and ioy exceedingly; in so much, as a man may finde sundrie Yeomen (although otherwise for wealth comparable with many of the gentile sort) that will not yet for all that change their condition, nor desire to be apparrelled with the titles of Gentrie. Neither is this any cause of disdaine, or of alienation of the good minds of the one sort from the other. For no where else in all this Realme, is the common people more willingly gouerned. To be short, they be most com∣monly ciuill, iust, and bountifull: so that the estate of the old Franklyns and Yeomen of England, either yet liueth in Kent, or else it is quite dead and departed out of the Realme for altogether. Thus farre in effect out of Lambard. Briefly, saith Selden, it had the first English King; in it was the first Christianity among the English, and Canterbury then honoured with the Metropolitique See : all which giue note of Honourable Prerogatiue. But I will conclude this commendation of Kent with these verses following, ta∣ken out of the foresaid Author of Polyolbion, in the same Song. When as the pliant Muse, straight turning her about, And comming to the Land as Medway goeth out, Saluting the deare soyle, O famous Kent, quoth she, What countrey hath this Isle that can compare with thee, Which hast within thy selfe as much as thou canst wish? Thy conies, Venson, Fruit, thy sorts of Fowle and Fish: And what with strength comports, thy hay, thy corne, thy wood: Nor any thing doth want, that any where is good. Now here, before I take my leaue of this little See of Rochester, it shall not seeme impertinent (I hope) to shew, The conclu∣sion of this Diocesse. with what great courage and hap∣pinesse this Church hath euer vpholden her rights and priuiledges, not onely against the Monkes of Canterbury (which laboured much to bring it vnder) but also against the See it selfe of the Archbishops. Lamb. For example, in the raigne of king Henry the third, and after the death of Benedict (the Bishop of Rochester) the Monkes made choise of one Hen∣ry Sanford (that great wise Clerke, which preached at Sittingbourne, that such a day the soules of king Richard the first, Godwin. Stephen Langton, Archbi∣shop of Canterbury, and another Priest, were deliuered out of Purgato∣ry, and no more soules that day, but onely they three, as God had reuea∣led it vnto him three seuerall times) whereof when the Monkes of Christ-Church had intelligence, they resisted the election, challenging that the Pastorall staffe or Crosyer of Rochester ought of very right to be brought to their house, after the decease of the Bishop, and that the election ought to be made in their Chapiter. The Monkes of Rochester maintained their owne choise, and so the matter waxing warme betweene them, it was at the length referred to the determination of the Archbishop: he againe posted it ouer to certaine Delegates, who hearing the parties, and weighing the proofes, gaue sentence with the Monkes of Rochester, and yet lost (as they thought) good loue and amity among them. But (as the Poet saith) Male sarta gratia, nequicquam coit, sed rescinditur : Fauour that is euill peeced, will not ioyne close, but falleth asunder. And therefore this their opinion failed them, and their cure proued but to be patched: for soone after, the sore brake out anew, and the Canterbury Monkes reuiued their displea∣sure with such a heat, that Hubert of Burgh, Earle of Kent, and chiefe Iu∣stice of England, was driuen to come into the Chapter house and coole it, and to worke a second reconciliation betweene them. Neither for all that (as it may seeme) was that flame quite extinguished. For not long after, viz. Ann. 1238. the Monkes of Christ-Church seeing that they them∣selues could not preuaile, intituled their Archbishop Edmund, with whom also the Rochester Monkes waged law at Rome before the holy Father (as touching the election of Richard Wendeouer, whom they would haue had Bishop) by the space of three whole yeares together: and at the length, either through the equitie of the cause, or the weight of their purse (saith my Author) ouerthrew him, Lamb. vpon Saint Cuthberts day, in ioy whereof, they returned home with all hast, and enacted in their Chapter house, that from thenceforth, for euer, Saint Cuthberts feast (as a Trophey of their vi∣ctory) should be holden double, both in their Church and Kitchin. And not thus onely, but otherwise also, hath the See at Rochester well holden her owne: for during the whole succession of fourescore Bishops and one (as I haue said before) which in right line haue followed Iustus, she hath continually maintained her chaire at this one place: whereas in most parts of the Realme besides, the Sees of the Bishops haue suffered sundrie translations, by reason that in the Conquerours time, order was taken, that such Bishops, as before had their Churches in countrey Townes and Villa∣ges, should forthwith remoue, and from thenceforth remaine in walled Townes and Cities: which ordinance could not by any meanes touch Ro∣chester, that was a walled Citie long time before king Williams gouern∣ment. Here endeth the Diocesse of Rochester. ANCIENT FVNERALL MONV∣MENTS WITHIN THE Diocesse of LONDON. A S before I haue said somewhat of the Cities of Canterbury and Rochester; so giue me leaue to speak a little of this great Citie of London, collected out of as well ancient as mo∣derne writers. And first I will borrow a few lines from Iohn Iohnston, before remembred, sometimes Professour of Diui∣nitie in the Vniuersitie of S. Andrewes in Scotland: who in a graue note and serious stile compiled certaine Latine verses in praise of this our Metropolis, Camd. Midlesex or soueraigne Citie of this Island. Which I finde to be translated by Philemon Holland, thus. This Citie well Augusta call'd, to which (a truth to say) Aire, Land, Sea, and all Elements, shew fauour euery way, The weather no where milder is, the ground most rich to see, Doth yeeld all fruits of fertile soile, that neuer spent will be: And Ocean, that with Tams streame his flowing tide doth blend Conueyes to it commodities, all that the world can send. The noble seat of Kings it is, for port and royalty, Of all the Realme the fence, the heart, the life, and lightsome y, The people ancient, valourous, expert in chiualry, Enriched with all sorts and meanes of Art and Mystery. Take heedfull view of euery thing, and then say thus in briefe, This either is a world it selfe, or of the world the chiefe. Sir Robert Dallington knight, in his view of France; comparing the City of Paris with London, saith, That Paris is the greater, the fairer built, and the better scituate: London is the richer, the more populous, the more an∣cient, which is an honour as well to great Cities, as to great families. And more ancient it is then any true Record beareth witnesse, saith Speed. Fabu∣led from Brute Troynouant, from Lud Ludstone ; but by more credible wri∣ters; Tacitus, Ptolemy, and Antonine, Londinium ; by Amianus Mar∣cellinus for her successiue prosperitie, Augusta, the greatest title that can be giuen to any. It was the first built Citie questionlesse of all in the kingdome. Of which my old Rimer Robert of Glocester. Ye furste lordes and maistres that in yis londe wer And ye chyff tounes furst yey le e arer. London and Yorke. Euerwyk, Lyncolne, and Leycestre, Colchestre, and Canterbery, Bristo , and Wercestre. And many Other. oyer tounes mo in Engelond and in Walis. This Citie, Speed. Midle∣sex. in respect of all other Cities of this Island, doth shew as the Cedars among other trees, being the seat of the British kings, the Chamber of the English, the modell of the land, and the Mart of the world: for thi∣ther are brought the silke of Asia, the spices from Africa, the Balmes from Grecia, and the riches of both the Indies East and West. No citie standing so long in fame, nor any for diuine and politike gouernment may with her be compared. It would ask, In Midlesex. saith Camd. a long time to discourse, particularly, of the good Lawes and orders, of the laudable gouernment, of the port and dignitie of the Maior and Aldermen, of their forward seruice and loyaltie to their Prince, of the Citizens curtesie, the faire building and costly furniture, the breed of excellent and choice wits, their gardens in the suburbs full of dain∣tie Arbours, and banqueting roomes, stored also with strange herbes from forraine countries, of the multitude, strength, and furniture of their ships, the incredible store of all sorts of merchandise; and of the superabundance of all things which belong to the furniture or necessitie of mans life. Accor∣ding as Hadrianus Iunius writes in his Philippeis, thus turned into English. Thicke built with houses London is, with riches stuffed full, Proud (if we may so say) of men that therein liue and dwell, Where in most plenteous wise abound all things that tongue can tel. Will. Warner writing of the foundation and Founder of this renowned Citie, giues it the like attributes. Now, Albions Eng∣land Chap. 14. if the Conquerour, this Isle had Brutaine vnto name, And with his Troians Brute began manurage of the same. For razed Troy to reare a Troy, fit place he searched then, And viewes the mounting Northerne parts: These fit (quoth hee) for men, That trust as much to flight as fight: our bulwarkes are our brests, The next Arriuals here, perchance, will gladlier build their nests: A Troians courage is to him a Fortresse of defence: And leauing so where Scots be now, he South-ward maketh thence: Whereas the earth more plenty gaue, and aire more temperature, And nothing wanted that by wealth or pleasure might allure. And more, the Lady Floud of Flouds, the Riuer Thamis, it Did seeme to Brute against the foe, and with himselfe to fit. Vpon whose fruitfull banks therefore, whose bounds are chiefly said, The wantlesse Counties Essex, Kent, Surrey, and wealthy Glayde Of Hartfordshire, for Cities store participating ayde, Did Brute build vp his Troy-nouant, in closing it with wall. Which Lud did after beautifie, and Luds-towne it did call, That now is London euermore to rightfull Princes trew, Yea Prince and people still to it, as to their store house drew, For plenty and for populous, the like we no where view. Howbeit many neighbour-Townes as much ere now could say; But place for people, people, place, and all for sinne decay. But of this matter many haue spoken much, and it is needlesse for me to say any more, especially considering that I shall haue occasion to say some∣what hereafter vpon the said subiect, when I come to the buriall of king Brutus. In the meane time I will conclude with a Rime Dogerell in com∣mendation of London, as the Authour himselfe calls it, who was Robert Fabian (Alderman and Sheriffe of this honourable Citie, in the ninth yeare of king Henry the seuenth) which you may reade in the Prologue to the second volume of his Chronicle of England and France.

Saint Pauls Church. The founda∣tion of Saint Pauls Church. As of the Cathedrall Churches in Canterbury and Rochester, so, I finde Ethelbert, king of Kent, to be the Founder of this, here in London; dedi∣cated to the honour of the euerliuing God, and Saint Paul, Doctor of the Gentiles. These are the words of his Charter, preserued here in the Church. Diploma Regis Ethelberti. In Christi nomine Aedelbertus Rex Deo inspirante, pro anime sue reme∣dio, dedit Episcopo Melito terram que appellatur Tillingeham, ad Monasterij sui solatium, scilicet Sancti Pauli Apostoli Doctoris Gentium. Et ego Aedel∣bertus ita firmiter concedo tibi Presuli Melito potestatem eius habendi & pos∣sidendi, vt in perpetuum in Monasterij vtilitate permaneat. Si quis vero con∣tradicere temptauerit hanc donationem, Anathema & excomunicatus sit ab omni societate Christiana, vsque ad satisfactionem. Qua de re ego Epis∣copus Melitus vna cum Rege Aedeberto Humfredum Episcopum subscribere rogaui. Signum manus Humfredi Episcopi. Signum manus Letharij Episcopi. Signum manus Abbane. Signum manus Aethelpaldi. Signum manus Aespine & aliorum multorum. Besides this his gift of Tillingham in Essex; dedit viginti quatuor Hidas terre iuxta Londoniam (as the Lieger booke of this Church speakes) the greatest part of which was afterwards diuided into Prebends, as More, Finnesbury, Oldstreet, Wenlocksborne, Hoxton, Newington, S. Pancrace, Kentishtowne, Totenhall, Ragener, Holborne, Portpole, Iseldon, and there onely remained to the Deane and Chapter, Norton Folgate. King Athelstan at the request of Bishop Theodred (surnamed the good) gaue Monasterio Sancti Pauli in Londonia Ciuitate, &c. decem Mansas ad Sandonam cum Rode, & octo ad Eardlage (now Yerdley ) cum Luffenhede, et decem ad Bylchampe cum Picham, et octo ad Lidwolditon (nunc Hey∣bridge) et duodecim ad Runwellam, et triginta ad Edelfesnesam (now Pauls soken in Essex) et decem ad Breytane, et octo ad Berne; et decem ad Neoldune cum Pislesdune. King Edgar at the request of Bishop Dunstan, and his third sonne (beau∣tifull young Ethelred ) pro sexaginta Mancis auri puri (which is threescore Markes of our English money) dedit ad Monasterium Sancti Pauli viginti quinque Mansiones, in loco qui vocatur Nasinstocke : Which were confir∣med by Etheldred, and diuers succeeding kings. Canutus or Knute the Dane, king of England, not onely confirmes his predecessours gifts, but also founds and endowes the dignitie of the Dean∣ry, with the Church of Lamborne (in Barkshire) pro victu decani qui pro tempore fuerit, The first Deane whereof was Leuegarus (as appeares by an ancient Catalogue of the Deanes amongst the Antiquities of this Church) whom succeeded Godwynus, Syredus, Gulielmus, Elfwynus, Luiredus, and in the Conquerours time Wolfmannus, after him Radulphus de Diceto, that great and iudicious Antiquarie; Qui velut alter Iosephus, aut Philo, (saith Bale Cent. 2.) suae gentis vetera Monumenta, atque inclita facta perpetuare studens, multa retroactis seculis incognita produxit in lucem. Edward the Confessour confirmes the gift of Wygaley (now West Lee in Essex) which one Ediua a religious woman gaue, Fratribus Sancti Pauli, and also giues himselfe Monasterio Sancti Pauli, octo Mansas ad Berling, et quinque ad Cynford, now Chyngford in Essex. Kensworth and Caddington, and diuers other lands were giuen to this Church before the Conquest, In Arch. Turris Lond. Cartae antiqua A. all which the Conquerour confirmes by his Charter remaining amongst the Records in the Tower, adding thereunto many ample priuiledges and immunities. Quia volo (saith he) vt ista Eccle∣sia ita sit libera in omnibus, sicut volo esse animam meam in die iudicij. More∣ouer, besides this confirmation, he gaue vnto this Church, and Mauritius the Bishop, the Castle of Stortford or Storford in Hertfordshire, with all the appurtenances belonging thereunto, for euer: and namely, the land which William the Deacon, and Raph his brother held of the king. William Rufus by his deed sealed, freeth the Canons of Pauls from all works to the walls and Tower of London, and withall confirmes all his fathers donations and priuiledges. This deed was dated at Hereford. Since which time, one Peter Newport (of which name and family many lie entombed in burnt Pelham, within Hertfordshire) gaue vnto this Church two hundred acres of wood, in Hadley, and Thundersey, in Essex, and fourescore Acres of arable land with a Brewhouse; out of which the Deane and Chapter were to pay a certaine summe of money to a Priest to say Masse for his soule. Sir Philip Basset knight, gaue Drayton to the Deane and Chapter, to the entent that they should pay 15. l. for euer to three Chapleynes, for the like seruice of saying Masse, and his Executours gaue Hayrstead, out of which there was yearely spent fiue pounds for an Obit. The Executors of Iohn of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, gaue to this Church the Mannors of Bowes, and Pecleshouse in Midlesex, for the maintenance of certaine Priests, to sing Masse for his soule. And of these Mannors the Church was possest vntill the latter end of king Henry the eight. The Churches of Willesdon, Sunbury, Brickesley, Rickling, and Aue∣ley, were impropriated to the Deane, and Chapter, by diuers Bishops; the Impropriations whereof were theirs at that time. Besides their lands and reuenues in the countrey, these Churchmen had diuers houses in the Citie, which were granted sometime Deo et Sancto Pau∣lo, sometime Deo et Sancti Pauli seruientibus, sometime Sancto Paulo et Canonicis. Of these I haue seene many deeds, among which one is most remarkable, dated in the yeare 1141. the sixth of king Stephen, and fastened with a labell to the end of a sticke, of what wood I know not, howsoeuer it remaines to this day free from worme-holes, or any the least corruption, not so much as in the barke. Whereby one Robert Fitz-Gousbert, for his soules health, giues vnto this Church a certaine parcell of land, or an house, containing eight foot in breadth, and sixe in length. Vpon which wood, or sticke, these words following are very faire written, Per hoc lig∣num oblata est terra Roberti filij Gousberti super altare Sancti Pauli in festo omnium Sanctorum. Testibus, &c. But to make an end of this discourse. Primitiua Ecclosie Sancti Pauli London fundatio (saith the Lieger booke) consistit in Episcopo, triginta maioribus Canonicis, duodecim minoribus, et triginta vicarijs: which dif∣fers from her present state, hauing at this time for her gouernours, a Bishop, a Deane, a Precentor, a Chancellour, a Treasurer, and fiue Archdeacons, viz of London, Middlesex, Essex, Colchester, and S. Albons, and thirty Prebendaries; and besides to furnish the Quire in diuine seruice, Pety-Ca∣nons twelue, Vicars Chorall six, and ten Queristers, &c. This Bishopricke comprehends the Citie of London, with the counties of Middlesex, and Essex, and the Deanries of Saint Albans, and Braughing in Hertfordshire. And is valued in the kings bookes at 1119. l. 8. s. 4. d. and yeelded the Pope from euery Bishop at his first entrance 3000. Florins, besides sixteene pounds ten shillings for Rome-scot, or Peter-pence. But now to the Monuments. Sebba king of the East-Saxons Hic iacet Sebba Rex Orientalium Saxonum qui conuersus fuit ad fidem per S. Erkenwaldum Londinens. Episcopum, anno Christi 677. Vir multum Deo deuotus, actibus religiosis, crebris precibus, & pijs eleemosynarum fru∣ctibus plurimum intentus; vitam priuatam et monasticam cunctis regni di∣uitijs & honoribus preferens. Qui cùm regnasset annis 30. habitum religio∣sum accepit per benedictionem Waltheri Londinens. Lib. 4. cap. 11. Antistitis qui prefa∣to Erkenwaldo successit, de quo venerabilis Beda in Historia gentis Ang∣lorum. The same Author further affirmes, that he not onely relinquished his Princely robes, and put on the habite of a Monke (a thing vsuall (as you haue heard before) with the Saxon kings in the infancie of Christian Re∣ligion) but also instigated his wife to leaue the momentanie pleasures of Courtly estate, and to follow him in his vertuous deuotions, which with much ado he obtained. Here he continued a Monke in this Monastery (for in his time, saith Radulphus de Diceto, were Monkes in this Church) vntill the day of his death, which happened in the yeare 693. Of this king Sebba thus much out of a late writer, Mich. Draiton, Polyol. Cant. 11. Then Sebba of his seed, that did them all surpasse, Who fitter for a Shrine, then for a Scepter was.

Hic iacet Etheldredus, Etheldred king of England, surnamed, The Vnready. Anglorum Rex, filius Edgari Regis, cui in die con∣secrationis post impositam Coronam, fertur S. Dunstanus Cantuar. Archiepis∣copus dira predixisse his verbis. Quoniam aspirasti ad Regnum per mortem fratris tui, in cuius sanguine conspirauerunt Angli cum ignominiosa matre tua, non deficiet gladius de domo tua seuiens in te omnibus diebus vite tue, interficiens de semine tuo quousque regnum tuam transferatur in regnum alienum, cuius ritum et linguam gens cui presides non nouit; nec expiabitur nisi longa vindicta peccatum tuum, et peccatum matris tue, & peccata viro∣rum qui interfuere concilio illius nequam. Que sicut à viro sancto predicta erant, euenerunt. Nam Etheldredus varijs prelijs per Swanum Danorum Re∣gem, filium que suum Canutum fatigatus & fugatus ac tandem Londini arcta obsidione conclusus, misere diem obijt anno dominice incarnationis 1017. post∣quam annis 36. in magna tribulatione regnasset. This Etheldred being neither forward in action, Will. Malms. nor fortunate in his pro∣ceedings, was commonly called, The vnready, an oppressour rather then a ruler of this kingdome, cruell in the beginning, wretched in the middle, and shamefull in the end. Of the calamities of these times by the Danish inua∣sion, will it please you heare my old Author. Swan with his power to Engelond com, Rob. Glocest.

Besides the prophesie of Dunstan, here set downe in this Inscription, and thus ratified by the euent; the transferring of this kingdome to other Na∣tions, was further likewise prophetically foretold by an holy Anchorite, saith, Hen. Hunting : Englished in these words by the Translatour of Ra∣nulph, Monke of Chester. Lib 6 cap. : ib. 1 ca lt.

Englyshmen for as much as they vse to dronkelewnes, to Treason, and to rechlesnes of Goddes hous, first by Danes, and then by Normans, and atte thirde time by Scottes they shall be ouercome. Suauis victoria Amor populi. The loue of the people was a pleasant sweet Conquest (a Motto which I saw depicted vnder the Armes of our late So∣ueraigne Lord King Iames, ouer one of the gates at Yorke, vpon his first auspicious entrance into that ancient Citie, Ann. 1603. die Aprilis 16.) Thus for a king to ouercome, was but to come, and to be welcome, to bee receiued of his Subiects in all places, with shouts and acclamations of ioy, demonstrations of truest loyaltie, loue, and obedience, and to be conducted and guarded with an admirable confluence of his Nobilitie, Gentrie, and Commons, vnto the Throne of his lawfull inheritance. Erkenwald Bi∣shop of Lond. Hoc in loco requiescit in domino Erconwaldus tertius post Anglosaxonum in Britannia ingressam Episcopus Londinensis, cuius in Episcopatu, & ante Episcopatum vita fuit sanctissima: ex nobili prosapia oriundus. Offe orienta∣lium Saxonum Regis erat filius, ad fidem Christianam à Mellito primo Lon∣dini Episcopo An. Dom. 642. conuersus. Is priusquam Episcopus factus esset duo preclara construxit Monasteria sumptibus suis, de bonis que ture hereditario sibi obuenerunt.

In Episcopatum vero anno salutis, 675. à Theodoro D robernensium siue Cantuarie Archiepiscopo sacratus est: Sebbam Orientalium Saxonum Regem ad Christi sidem conuertit, et salutari Baptismatis vnda suis manibus per fudit, qui statim mundo renuncians, se totum Deo addixit, & in hac ipsa Ecclesia archa marmorea (que ad nostra vsque tempora permanet) sepultus est. Idem Erconwaldus celeberrimum hoc S. Pauli templum nouis edi∣ficijs auxit, prouentibus locupletauit, et eidem immunitates nonnullas à Re∣gibus impetrauit. Tandem circiter annum Domini 685. spiritum Deo red∣didit, postquam annis vndecim in pontificatu sedisset. Et magnifico sepulchro hic conditus est, quod nostra memoria circiter annum Domini, 1533. hoc loco visebatur. This carefull holy Bishop Erconwald, not onely bestowed great paines and charges vpon the beautifying and enlarging his Church with faire new buildings, De gestis Pontif. lib. 2. which he enricht with more ample reuenues; and many immu∣nities obtained from diuers kings and Princes; but also procured from Pope Agatho the first, sundry important priuiledges for the good of his Canons. Habetur ergo Erkenwaldus (saith Malmesbury ) Londonie maxime sanctus, & pro exauditionis celeritate, fauorem Canonicorum nonnihil emeritus. Beda lib. 4. ca. 6. Venerable Bede, and the Annals of this Church (from whom the most) of this Inscription is borrowed) do attribute many miracles to the holinesse of this man, Harpsfeeld. Se∣cul. 7. cap. 13. in regard of which he was canonized, and his Reliques transla∣ted, Anno salutis millesimo centesimo quadragesimo : and the fourteenth day of Nouember, appointed to be kept sacred to his memory. As in our Ka∣lender may be seene. Hic iacet Eustachius de Fauconberg quondam Episcopus huius Ecclesie qui multa bona contulit ministris Ecclesie S. Pauli. Eustace de Fau∣conbridge Bi∣shop of Lond. This Bishop, as appeares by an Inscription annexed to his Tombe, had beene one of the Kings Iustices, Lord Treasurer of England, and twice Em∣bassadour into France. And dyed Octob. 31. 1228. hauing gouerned this See seuen yeares and sixe moneths. Of whom I haue read this Epitaph in an old Manuscript. Hic iacet Eustachius, In bib. Cott. redolens vt Asyria nardus, Virtutum multis floribus, & meritis. Vir fuit hic magnus, & Episcopus ..... vt Agnus Vita conspicuus, dogmate precipuus. Pro quo qui transis supplex orare memor sis Vt sit ei saties alma Dei facies. The like Inscription and Table is to the memory of Henry de Wingham (so named of Wingham in Kent the place of his birth) he had been Cham∣berlaine of Gascoigne, Henry de Wing∣ham Bishop of London. Deane of Totenhall, and Saint Martins, twice Em∣bassadour into France, Mat. Paris. and Lord Chancellour of England. Rex enim de fide∣litate Domini Henrici de Vuengham experta confisus, qui clericus eius et con∣siliarius extitisset specialis, commisit eidem custodiam Sigilli. He enioyed this Bishopricke but a short time, being taken away by death, Iuly 13. 1262. as appeares by this Epitaph. De Wengham natus Henricus ad astra leuatus Lib. Mon. de Wauerley in bib. Cott.

Solus Episcopus cum vno Diacono remansit intrepidus. Aere tandem purgato Episcopus residuum rei Diuine expleuit. You may reade more of him, in Mathew Paris, how stoutly hee with¦stood the Popes Nuntio, comming here into England with a proling deuise to scrape vp money for his Master. How this good Bishop cried out vpon the vnreasonable and shamelesse couetousnesse of the Court of Rome, and how hee was the onely meanes of staying the course of such grieuous ex∣actions. There you may also reade the fearfull story of this Cymerian darknesse, and horrible thunderclap, which happened vpon the day of S. Pauls con∣uersion, in this Cathedrall Church, the Bishop being then at Masse. Many miracles, saith the same Author, were wrought at his Tombe. But let vs heare his Epitaph. Ecclesie quondam Presul presentis, in anno M. bis C. quater X. iacet hic Rogerus humatus. Huius erat manibus Domino locus iste dicatus: Christe suis precibus veniam des, tolle reatus. It was this Bishop Roger, who excommunicated the Caursini (a dange∣rous stout attempt in those dayes) called the Popes Merchants, but they were indeed most execrable Romane Vsurers, who had entangled the king himselfe, most of the Nobilitie, and all others that had to do with the Court of Rome, in their cunning snares. They were called Caursini (saith Paris ) quasi capientes vrsi: deuouring Beares. Orate pro anima Roberti Brabroke ..... quondam Episcopi huius Eccle∣sie, cuius corpus hic tumulatur, Rob. Braybrooke Bishop of Lon∣don. qui obijt 27. Augusti 1405. cum sedisset, Ann. 20. This Bishop was aduanced to the honour of being Lord Chancellour, vpon Saint Mathewes Eue, in the sixth yeare of king Richard the second; which office he enioyed no longer then the March following, vpon some disagreement betwixt him and Iohn of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster. Of which you may reade more at large in Tho. Walsingham, Hist. Angl. Rob. Fitz-Hugh Bishop of Lon∣don. Here lieth interred the body of Robert Fitz-Hugh, Bishop of London, Doctor of Law, and sometimes Archdeacon of Northampton, who had beene twice Embassadour, once into Germany, and another time to Rome. Hee was elected Bishop of Ely, but died before his intended translation could be perfected, Septemb. 22. Ann. 1435. To which effect thus speakes his Epitaph. Nobilis Antistes Robertus Londoniensis, Filius Hugonis, his requiescit honor Doctorum, flos Pontificij quem contulit Ely, Rome Basilie Regia facta refert. Plangite eum Rex, grex, tria natio tota, Extera gens, si qua nouerat vlla pium. Gemma pudicitie, spectrum bonitatis, honoris, Famaque Iusticie, formula iuris erat.

This Thomas Kempe was Nephew to Iohn Kempe, Archbishop of Can∣terbury, at whose hands hee receiued Consecration, at Yorke place, now called White hall, Ann. 1449. Febr. 8. his Vnkle being as then Archbishop of Yorke. This Bishop, and not Duke Vmphrey (as it is commonly belee∣ued by report) built, Brian Twyn. Antiq. Acad. Ox. for the most part, the Diuinitie Schooles in Oxford, as they stood before Bodleyes foundation; with walls, Arches, Vaults, doores, towers, and pinnacles, all of square, smooth, polisht stone, and ar∣tificially depainted the Doctors Chaire, to the liuely representation of the glorious frame of the celestiall globle. He built also Pauls Crosse in forme as as it now standeth. Here lieth Iohn Stokesley Bishop of this Church, Iohn Stokesley Bishop of Lon∣don. brought vp at Magde∣lene Colledge in Oxford, and here enthronized Iuly 19. 1530. Who died Septemb. 8. 1539. A part of his Epitaph as yet remaines inlaid in brasse, which approues him to haue beene a good Linguist, and a great Schollar.

I reade in the Catalogue of Bishops, William Bishop of London. and other writers (for all the In∣scriptions of any Antiquitie, made to the memory of other Bishops here interred, are altogether erazed or stolne away) that William a Norman, who enioyed this Bishopricke in the Conquerours time, lieth here interred in the body of the Church. Vnto whom the City of London acknow∣ledgeth it selfe greatly beholding, for that the king, by his meanes and in∣stant suite, granted vnto them all kinde of liberties, in as ample manner as they enioyed them in the time of his predecessour Ed. the Confessour. These are the words of the Conquerours grant, written in the Saxon tongue, and sealed with greene waxe. Williem king grets Williem Bisceop, Charta London. and Godfred Porterefan, and ealle ya Burghwarn binnen London Frencisce and Englise frendlice, and ickiden eoy, yeet ic wille yeet git ben ealra weera lagay weore, ye get weeran on Eadwards daege kings.

And I make knowne to you, that ye be worthy to enioy all that Law and priuiledge which ye did in the dayes of King Edward. And I will that euery childe bee his fathers heire after his fathers decease. And I will not suffer that any man doe vnto you any iniurie. God you keepe. In thankfulnesse hereof, the Citizens caused to bee engrauen an Epitaph vpon his Tombe in Latine, thus Englished by Iohn Stow. To William, a man famous in wisedome and holinesse of life, who first with Saint Edward the king and Confessour being familiar, of late preferred to be Bishop of London, and not long after, for his prudencie and sincere fidelitie, admitted to be of Councell with the most victorious Prince Willi∣am king of England, of that name the first, who obtained of the same great and large priuiledges to this famous City. The Senate and Citizens of Lon∣don, to him hauing well deserued, haue made this. Hee continued Bishop twenty yeares, and dyed in the yeare after Christ his natiuitie, 1070. These marble Monuments to thee thy Citizens assigne, Rewards (O father) farre vnfit to those deserts of thine. Thee vnto them a faithfull friend, thy London people found, And to this Towne, of no small weight, a stay both sure and sound. Their liberties restorde to them, by meanes of thee haue beene, Their publike weale by meanes of thee, large gifts haue felt and seene Thy riches, stocke, and beauty braue, one houre hath them supprest, Yet these thy vertues, and good deeds, with vs for euer rest. But this Tombe was long since either destroyed by time, or taken away vpon some occasion: yet howsoeuer the Lord Maior of London, and the Aldermen his brethren, vpon those solemne dayes of their resort to Pauls, do still vse to walke to the grauestone where this Bishop lyeth buried, in re∣membrance of their priuiledges by him obtained. And now of late yeares an Inscription fastened to the pillar next adioyning to his graue (called, The reuiuall of a most worthy Prelates remembrance, erected at the sole cost and charges of the right honourable and nobly affected Sir Edward Barkham knight, Lord Maior of the Citie of London, Ann. 1622.) thus speakes to the walkers in Pauls: Walkers, whosoere you be, If it proue your chance to see, Vpon a solemnes skarlet day, The Citie Senate passe this way, Their gratefull memory for to show Which they the reuerend ashes owe Of Bishop Norman here inhum'd; By whom this Citie hath assum'd Large priuiledges. Those obtain'd By him, when Conquerour William raign'd. This being by thankfull Barkhams mynd renewd, Call it the Monument of Gratitude. Here lieth buried Fulk Basset, Fulke Basset Bishop of Lon∣don. Bishop of this Church, preferred hither from the Deanrie of Yorke, a Gentleman of an ancient great family, second brother of that Gilbert Basset, who through the stumbling of his horse, fell in a certaine wood, Mat. as hee went a hunting in the haruest time, Ann. 1241. and brake so his bones and sinewes, that within a few dayes after he dyed: and shortly after, euen in the same moneth, the onely sonne of this Gilbert, being a childe, died, whereby that lordlie inheritance came to this Fulk Basset : who, as he was a man of great linage, and also of ample, both tem∣porall, and Ecclesiasticall possessions, so was hee a Prelate of an inuincible high spirit; stout and couragious to resist those insupportable exactions which the Popes Legate Rustandus, Paris. went about to lay vpon the Clergie, and at such a time when the Pope and the king, like the Shepheard and the Woolfe, ioyned both together to destroy the Sheepfold. Much what about which time, to the same effect, certaine rimes were scattered abroad, as I haue before set downe in the Diocesse of Canterbury. Such were the Popes rapines and enormous proceedings in those dayes, all which this stout Bishop withstood to the vttermost of his power. Hee died of the plague here in London, Ann. 1258. hauing gouerned this See 14. yeares odde moneths. A Monument was made to his eternall memory, whereupon this Distich was inlaid in brasse.

Chishull Bi∣shop of Lond. who sometimes had beene Deane of Pauls, Archdeacon and Bishop of London, Lord Trea∣surer of England, Mat. Westm. and twice Keeper of the great Seale. He was consecrated Aprill 29. 1274▪ and died the tenth, 1279. Vpon the Monument of Richard Newport, Rich. Newport Bishop of Lon¦don. Bishop of this Church here buried, a little inscription not long since was to be read, expressing the day and yeare of his consecration, which was March 26. 1317. And the like of his death, which happened August 24. 1318. the yeare following. Raph Baldocke, Raph Baldocke Bishop of Lon∣don. Deane of this Church, was chosen Bishop vpon Saint Mathias day, 1303. but was not consecrated till the yeare 1305. Ianuary 30. which he receiued at the hands of one Petrus Hispanus, a Cardinall, Bishop of Alba, at Lions in France. He was a man very well learned, and amongst other things, writ an History or Chronicle of England, in the La∣tine tongue. Godwin. Catal. In his life time he gaue two hundred Markes toward the buil∣ding of the Chappell on the East end of this Church, now called, The Lady Chappell; wherein he lieth buried: and in his Will bequeathed much to∣ward the finishing of the same. And here by the way, saith mine Author, it shall not bee amisse to note, that in digging the foundation of this build∣ing, there were found more then an hundred heads of cattell, as oxen, kine, stagges, Stow. Annal. &c. which seeme to confirme the opinion of those that thinke the Temple of Iupiter was scituate in that place before the planting of Chri∣stian Religion; Fran. Thinne. tooke away those idolatrous sacrifices. This Bishop was chosen Lord Chancellour by king Edward the first. Vpon whose death he sent the great Seale to king Edward the second, as then lying at Carliell. This Raph is mistaken by some writers for Robert Baldock, Bishop of Nor∣wich (yet I finde no such Bishop of that See in the Catalogue) sometime Archdeacon of Midlesex, and Chancellour of England. Much what about that time, a man that liued in the hatred of most people, whom the old English Chronicle calleth a false peeld Priest: Rob. Glocest. these are the words; Robart Baldok his false pilide Chanceler (being as then Chancellour to Ed∣ward the second) and in another place, Ye pilide clerk Robart Baldok, ye fals Chanceler. Yet this pilide fals clerk was euer trew to the King his Lord and Master: for which he was taken and imprisoned in Newgate London, wherein he miserably ended his dayes. Of which thus writeth the Author of the booke of Durham. .

But to returne to Raph (for I haue somewhat digressed from the matter) Bishop of this Diocesse, who, when from his first confirmation by Robert of Winchelsey, Bishop of Canterbury, he had sate about eight yeares, died on S. Iames his Eue, 1313. at Stell. Michaell North∣brooke Bishop of London. Here lyeth buried Michaell Northbrooke, Bishop of this See, Doctor of Law, who had his election confirmed Iuly 7. 1355. and died of the plague, Septemb. 9. 1361. at Copford.

Catal. and died, August 20. 1421. This Bishop in the yeare 1414. tra∣uelled to the Councell of Constance, and preached in Latine before the Em∣perour, and other Estates there assembled. In this Councell the long schisme was ended, and Martin the fifth, called before Otho Columna, Car∣dinall of Saint George, was chosen the sole Pope. The Councell thinking it meete that thirtie persons should be added to the Cardinals in this election; this our Richard Clifford was one of that number. In which also there were some that named him to the Papacie. Himselfe was the first that named the Cardinall Columna: who thereupon, the rest consenting, was immediately elected. Betweene the two pillars, next vnto the Steeple, on the North side of the body of the Church, vnder a marble stone, ouer which was built a kind of Tombe, Richard Fitz-Iames Bishop of London. or Chappell of wood, that by the burning of the steeple was consumed, and quite defaced; the body of Rich. Fitz-Iames lieth interred. A gentleman of an ancient house, learned and vertuous: Doctor of Law, brought vp in Merton Colledge in Oxford, and sometimes Warden of the same; Godwin. de Praesul. Ang. from whence hee was aduanced to the Bishopricke of Rochester, from thence translated to Chichester, and from Chichester to London. He bestowed much money in repairing the Church of S.

His first wife Blanch, Blanch Duch∣esse of Lan∣caster. here buried, died of the plague, saith Io. Stow, Ann. 1369. She ordained for her husband and her selfe, a solemne Obit to bee kept yearely in this Church, where the Maior, being present at the Masse with the Sheriffes, Fabian. Chamberlaine, and Swordbearer, should offer each of them a pennie, and the Maior to take vp twentie shillings: the Sheriffes either of them a Marke, the Chamberlaine ten shillings, and the Sword∣bearer sixe shillings eight pence, and euery other of the Maiors officers (there present) two and twenty pence a peece: the which Obyte, saith Fa∣bian, to this day is holden. She also founded foure Chantrees in this Church for the soules of her selfe and her husband; and was greatly beneficiall vnto the Deane and Canons.

Hee was stiled Earle of Lincolne, Baron of Halton, Constable of Chester, Lord of Pomfret, Blackburnshire, Ros in Wales, and Rowennocke.

He died at his house, now called Lincolnes Inne in Chancerie-lane London, Feb. the fifth, 1310. being threescore yeares of age, as I haue it out of the booke of Whalley, Lib.

In the same Chappell, dedicated to S. Dunstan, lieth Laurence Allerthorp, sometimes Canon of this Church, and Lord Treasurer of England, with this Inscription. Hic iacet Laurentius Allerthorp quondam Thesaurarius Anglie, Canoni∣cus & Stagiarius istius Ecclesie, qui migrauit ex hoc seculo mens. Iulij die 21. 1406. This Allerthorp being a man of no more eminencie in the Church then a Canon resident, was neuer thought of, or not beleeued, by the Francis Thinne Collector of the Lord Treasurers, to haue ascended to such an honour, so that he lies here in a darksome roome, as a sacrifice to obliuion; small notice taken of him, except by some few of the Churchmen. Now giue mee leaue to tell you, by way of digression, that howsoeuer this Allerthorp was but one of the Canons resident, yet he was solely the one, and had most or all the re∣uenues of the rest in his hands; for (as the Records of this Church doe ap∣proue) those thirtie Canons vpon the primarie institution, called Canons Regular (because they led a regular life, and were perpetually resident) and afterwards liuing abroad, and neglecting the businesse of their Church, be∣came to be called Canons secular, contenting themselues with the title of Canon, and some prebend assigned vnto them. Which annexing of lands to the Prebendarie was not till a long time after the first foundation: where∣upon Pope Lucius by his Bull ordained, that the Canons non-resident, should not partake of the profits of the lands assigned to the common af∣faires of the Church, but onely such as were resident (the diuision of the Churches lands hauing beene made before in the time of the Conquerour) and this Laurence Allerthorp, at and before the time of his Treasurship, was solus residentiarius, and had the whole reuenue of the rest at his owne disposing, by way of Option, as it is called in the Lieger booke. But of this enough, if not too much. Then to conclude, howsoeuer this Allerthorp be altogether excluded out of the Treatise of the Treasurers, and Sir Iohn Northberie, knight, keeper of the priuie Garderobe in the Tower, said to be Lord Treasurer in the first, second, and third of king Henry the fourth: in which time the said Allerthorp should enioy that office, or not at all. Yet these words in his Patent, together with this Epitaph, do approue him to haue beene adorned with the honourable Office of a solicitous Lord Treasurer.

Edward the blacke Prince tooke such affection to this Sir Simon Burley for his valour, wisedome, and true seruice, that he committed to his gouer∣nance his onely sonne (then liuing) Richard of Burdeux ; who, being after∣wards king of England, by the name of Richard the second, aduanced him to high honours, offices, and promotions: and nothing was done in mat∣ters of State without his appointment and direction. Thus hee continued alwayes loyall to his Soueraigne Lord the king; yet liued in the hatred of the Peeres of the Land, as also of the common people, for that he leaned to the partie of Robert de Veere, Stow. Annal. Earle of Oxford, Duke of Ireland, and the kings fauorite, and was an oppressour of the poore Commons: insomuch that by the sentence of that Parliament, which wrought wonders, An. 11. Ric. secundi, hee was condemned of treason, and beheaded on the Tower hill; as in the Inscription. He was first Vicechamberlaine to king Richard, who made him Con∣stable of Douer Castle, and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports; deliuering the keyes of the said Castle to the said Simon in signe of possession: so much would he grace him with his presence, thus recorded.

Legum qui tata dictauit vera statuta; Ex Hengham dictus Radulphus vir benedictus. This flower of our English Garden, this learned father of the Law, this blessed man (as this Epitaph would make him) was no better then a bri∣bing Iudge; for, being a chiefe Commissioner for the gouernment of the kingdome, in the absence of Edward the first, he, with many others of his profession, were, at the kings returne, found guiltie by act of Parliament, of manifest corruption, Iudges fined for briberie and extortion. in their administration of Iustice, and deeply fined for such their intolerable extortions. First this Sir Raph Hengham, chiefe Iustice of the higher Bench, was fined to pay to the king seuen thousand Markes. Stow. Annal. Sir Iohn Loueton Iustice of the lower Bench 3000. Markes. Sir William Brompton Iustice, 6000. Markes. Sir Salomon Rochester, 4000. Markes. Sir Richard Boyland 4000. Markes. Sir Thomas Sodington 2000. Markes. Sir Walter Hopton 2000. Markes.

And Thomas Weyland (found the great∣est delinquent, and of greatest substance) had all his goods, and whole estate confiscated to the king, and withall banished the kingdome. This Sir Raph Hengham was a Norfolke man borne, as I haue it out of an old Record; these are the words. Radulphus de Hengham ex eadem ortus esse videtur familia, ex qua, Willielmus filius Ade de Hengham et Richardus de Hengham in Pago Norfolciens plerumque Thetfordie Iusticiarij ad Assi∣sas capiendas, et ad Gaolam deliberandam sub initijs Hen. 3. in Archiuis sepe memorantur, Rot.

And (as I am told) Vijs & modis, more comes to the Schoolemaster at this day, then the whole endowment.

Hic iacet Dominus Richardus de Piriton, quondam Archidiaconus Col∣cestrie, Canonicus et stagiarius huius Ecclesie, qui obijt 26. Aug. Ann. Dom. 1387. Cuius anime propitietur Deus. Amen. Vpon the wall ouer the little doore that entreth out of Pauls into Saint Faiths Church, is the image of Iesus, curiously painted, as also the pourtrai∣ture of a Lady kneeling in her mantle of Armes, with some of her progeny. These words thereupon being most artificially pensild. Iesus our God and Sauiour, To vs and ours be gouernour. Which imagerie or representation was made to the memory of Margaret Countesse of Shrewsbury, who lieth buried in a Chappell within that doore dedicated to the name of Iesus, with this Inscription, which not long since was there to be read vpon a pillar. Margaret Countesse of Shrewsbury. Here, before the Image of Iesu, lieth the worshipfull and right noble La∣die, Margaret, Countesse of Shrewsbury, late wife of the true and victo∣rious knight, and redoubtable warrior, Iohn Talbot Earle of Shrewsbury: which worshipfull man died in Guien, for the right of this Land. She was the first daughter, and one of the heires of the right famous and renowned knight, Richard Beauchamp, late Earle of Warwicke (which died in Roan) and of Dame Elizabeth his wife. The which Elizabeth was daughter and heire to Thomas, late Lord Berkeley, on his side, and on her mothers side, Ladie Lisle and Tyes. Which Countesse passed from this world the foure∣teenth day of Iune, in the yeare of our Lord, 1468. On whose soule Iesu haue mercy. Amen. I haue seene a stone in the body of this Church thus inscribed, without any name; yet Armes were vpon the Monument. Non hominem aspiciam vltra. Obliuio. This man yet willingly (saith learned Camden ) would not haue beene forgotten, R maines. when he adioyned his Armes to continue his memory; not vn∣like to Philosophers which prefixed their names before their Treatises of contemning glory. Another, in the North Cloister now ruinated, without name, had this Inscription vpon his Graue-stone: Vixi, peccaui, penitui, Nature cessi. Which was as Christian (saith the same Author) as that was profane of the Romane: Romaines. Amici Dum viuimus Viuamus. I haue read these rimes following, engrauen in brasse, vpon a marble∣stone, in the body of the Church, now stolne away. Istuc qui graderis paulum te sistere queso Et rogitans quid eris in me, nunc vermibus eso. Esto memor mortis, meditare frequenter Ioua: Mors latet in portis, non est euitabilis hora. Effundens loculos, pro Christo despice mundum. Clarificans oculos, vt cernas quo sit eundum. Nam quod quisque serit presentis tempore vite, Hoc sibi messis erit, cum dicitur, ite venite. The sleight regard of the house of God, was a maine cause of this king∣domes subuersion, as I haue shewed before vpon the Epitaph of king E∣theldred ; and it hath euer beene, and more especia ly is in these our times, an vse for beastly and vncleane persons, to pollute and beda be the doores and walls of the place where God is to be worshipped, with pisse, or some other more nastie excrements; against the like irreuerence to this goodly consecrated Edifice of Saint Paul, diuers prohibitions vpon certaine penal∣ties haue beene, and are daily, published in print, and pasted vp in iuers places, in and about the Church. And anciently this Atheisticall vncl n∣nesse (if I may so call it) was forbidden by a verse depicted at euery doore of this Church; some part of which at the great South doore is yet re ∣ning, which in my time might perfectly be read. Thus it runnes. Hic Locus his sacer est, hic nulli mingere fas est. This house is holy here: vnlawfull ti's For any one, here on her walls to pisse. And strict orders were likewise published against Beggers, and bearers of burdens, in and thorow the Church: of the later sort these foure lines were sometimes fixed to a pillar, ouer an iron boxe for the poore. All those that shall enter within the Church doore, With burden or basket, must giue to the poore. And if there be any aske what they must pay, To this Box a penny, ere they passe away. It could be wished, that walking in the middle Isle of Paules might be forborne in the time of Diuine seruice. Richard the second, The founda∣tion Pe y Canons. king of England, Ann. Reg. 8. made the pettie Ca∣nons here twelue in number, a Colledge, or fellowship daily to meete and diet together in one Hall; whereas for a long time before they liued disper∣sedly, and could not be so ready to serue the most Highest in their holy ex∣ercises. Hee appointed one Iohn Linton for the first Warden of this Col∣ledge, and gaue vnto the said Warden and Canons of the foresaid Fellow∣ship, certaine lands here in London for their further endowment, and the supporting of diuine seruice. Charging them by his Charter to pray for his prosperous estate liuing, and for his soules health when he should depart this world: and for the soule of Anne his wife, Queene of England: and for the soules of his and her progenitors, parents, and ancestors, and of all the faithfull people deceased. Polyol. 1. Song. land. ad Cyg. Cant. Howsoeuer the Story of Brute be denied by some learned Authors, or not permitted but by coniecture; as Selden hath it in his Illustrations vpon this verse of Michaell Drayton, which now the enuious world doth slander for a dreame. Yet because I finde him, in our Annals, to haue beene buried here in this Citie, of his owne foundation, as both by reason and authority it is strong∣ly argued by a most iudicious Antiquarie of the last age; I think it not amisse to speake somewhat of him (especially) in this place, as the truth of the sto∣rie is generally receiued. Brute King of great Britaine. Brute (the sonne of Siluius, the sonne of Ascanius, who was the sonne of Aeneas the warlike Troian) being deliuered from the long captiuitie vn∣der the Grecians, with his wife Innogen and his people, departed from the coasts of Greece, and arriued in an Island, where they consulted with an Oracle, sacred to Diana. Brute himselfe kneeling before the Idoll, and hold∣ing in his right hand a boule prepared for sacrifice full of wine, & the bloud of a white Hinde; made his imprecation to the Goddesse to this effect in English. Gildas Cambrius Thou Goddesse that doest rule the woods and forrests greene, And chasest foaming boares that fly thine awfull sight: Thou that mayest passe aloft in aerie skies so sheene; And walke eke vnder earth in places voide of light: Discouer earthly states, direct our course aright, And shew where we shall dwell, according to thy will, In seats of sure abode, where Temples we may dight For Virgines that shall sound thy land with voices shrill. After this prayer and ceremonie done, according to the Pagan rite and custome, Brute abiding his answer, fell asleepe: in which sleepe appeared to him the said Goddesse vttering this answer. Brute, farre by West beyond the Gallike land is found An Isle, which with the ocean seas inclosed is about. Where Giants dwelt sometime, but now is desart ground, Most meet where thou maiest plant thy selfe with all thy rout. Make thitherwards with speed; for there thou shalt finde out An euer-during seat, and Troy shall rise anew, Vnto thy race, of whom shall kings be borne, no doubt, That with their mighty power the world shall whole subdew. Brute was no sooner awaked then that he related this his dreame or vi∣sion to such of his companie, as he thought requisite to be acquainted with such a matter of importance; after great reioycing and ceremonious thanks¦giuing, they ioyntly resolued to seeke out this fortunate Island, and so re∣turned to their ships, with great ioy and gladnesse, as men put in comfort to finde out the wished seats for their firme and sure habitations, prophe∣sied and promised vnto them by the Oracle; not long after Per varios casus per tot discrimina rerum. Passing through many dangers, by sea, by land, 'mongst strangers: They landed at Totnes in Deuonshire, about the yeare of the world, 2855. and before Christs natiuitie, 1108. Of which M. Drayton Polyol. Song. 1. Mye Britaine-sounding Brute ; when with his puissant fleete At Totnesse first he toucht. Brute hauing taken a view of this Island, and destroyed all such as stood against him, commanded that the Isle should be called Brutaine (which be∣fore was called Albion, peopled with gyants) and the inhabitants thereof Britaines, or Brutaines, allusiuely after his owne name. Within a short time after his arriuall, he laid the foundation of a Citie, which he named Troy∣nouant, or new Troy (now London) vpon a plot of ground lying on the North side of the riuer of Thames, which he built in remembrance of that noble City of Troy, from whence hee and his people were descended, as also to bee the seat Royall, and chiefe Chamber of his imperiall king∣dome. He also built a Temple to the honour of his Pagan Gods and God∣desses. Which stood (by coniecture) in the same place where now this Ca∣thedrall Church of Saint Paul is erected: in which idolatrous Archflamen he bequeathed his body to be buried. Here in his new Citie, when he had established certaine lawes, teaching his people to liue after a ciuill order and fashion; also to build townes and villages, to worship the Gods, to till and plow the earth, to weare apparrell, to anoint and trimme their bodies: and to be short, to liue after an humane manner, and had holden the regiment of this kingdome right nobly the space of twenty and foure yeares, hee de∣parted the world. Hauing parted his dominions into three parts, amongst his three sonnes, Locrine, Camber, and Albanact : with condition, that the two younger brethren should hold of the eldest, and to him doe homage and fealtie. Brute tooke shippe and arriued in Albion; Hard. in vi . Bruti. Where Diane said, should been his habitation; And when he came the coasts of it vpon, He was full glad, and made great exultacion. And afterwards vpon the alteration of the name of Albion, the building of London, the establishing of his lawes, the diuision of his Empire, as also of his death and buriall, the same Author hath these verses. This Brutus, thus was king in regalite, And after his name, he called this Ile Briteyn; And all his menne by that same egalite He called Briteynes, as croniclers all saine. So was the name, of this ilke Albion, All sette on side, in Kalandes of a change, And putte awaye with great confusion, And Briteyn hight; so furth by new exchange After Brutus. The citee great of Troynouaunt so faire He buylded then on Thamys for his delite Vnto the North for his dwellyng, and for his most repaire Whiche is to saie in our language perfite New Troy. In whiche throughout his peace and law he sette, Whiche been the floures of all regalite; With out whiche, but if thei twoo be mette, There may no Prince hold principalite, Ne endure long in worthy dignite. For if those twoo be nought vpholden than; What is a kyng more worth then his liege man. This kyng Brute kepte well this Isle in peace; And sette his lawes of Troye with orders, rites, And consuetudes, that might the land encreace, Such as in Troye was most profittes, Vnto the folke, and the common profettes. He made theim wryten for long rememory, To rule the Isle by theim perpetually. His menne he did rewarde full royally With lands and rentes, that with hym suffred pain▪ And Troynouaunt he made full specially An Archflaume, his sea Cathedrall certain, A Temple thereof Apolyne to opteyne By Troyane lawe of all such dignite As Archbyshop hath now in his degre. This kyng Brutus made people faste to tylle The land aboute, in places both farre and nere; And sowe with sede, and get them corne full wele, To liue vpon, and haue the sustenaunce clere, And so in fields both farre and nere; By his wysdome, and his sapience, He sette the lande in all suffycience: And as the fate of death doth assigne That nedes he muste his ghoost awaye relees To his goddas Dyane he did resigne His corps to be buryed withouten lees In the Temple of Apolline, to encreace His soule amonge the goddes euerychone After his merites tronized high in trone. It is said (saith Sir Edward Coke to the Reader of the third part of his Reports) that Brutus the first king of this land, as soone as hee had setled himselfe in his kingdome, for the safe and peaceable gouernment of his people, wrote a booke in the Greeke tongue, calling it, The Lawes of the Britanes: and he collected the same out of the Lawes of the Troianes. Brute died after the Creation, 2806. yeares, before the Incarnation, 1103. Sa∣muel then Iudge of Israel. Robert of Glocester, my old Mss. hath these rimes touching some pas∣sages in this History of Brute. Brute wende forth. fory in he. ye lond, and espied vp and doun For to seche a fair plas to mak an hau . owne. an heued toun. He com and fond vpe Temese a place fair ynough, A good contre and plenteuous, and thither▪ yuder his herte drough: Yat shippes out of eche londe myght bryng good ywys; there.

Yo thys was ydo Aftur yat he com into Engelond ye xxiiii yere: I buryed he was at London yat he lette furst arere. Thus much of king Brute, as the brute of him goes, and as the vulgar receiued opinion is, the maine points of his story being brought into que stion by many of our learned authenticall writers. The Conquerour William brought with him from Roane in Normandy certaine Iewes, The body of a boy found in Saint B n is Church-yard by Pauls Wha fe, en∣shrined after∣wards in this Church, who was martyred by the Iewes. Stow. Annal. whose posterity here inhabiting within the prime Cities of the kingdome, did vse sometimes to steale away, circumcise, crowne with thornes, whip, torture, and crucifie some one of their neighbours male chil∣dren, in mockery, despite, scorne, and derision of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ, crucified by the Iewes in Ierusalem. In the yeare 1235. the 19. of Hen. the third, seuen Iewes were brought before the king at Westminster, which at Norwich had stolne a boy, and kept him from the sight of Christian people, for the space of one whole yeare, and had circumcised him, minding also to haue crucified him at the solemnitie of Easter, as themselues confessed before the king; whereof they were conuicted, their bodies and goods remaining at the kings pleasure. In the 39. of the said kings raigne, vpon the 22. day of Nouember; one hundred and two Iewes were brought from Lincolne to Westminster, and there accused, for the crucifying of a child of eight yeares old, named Hugh: these Iewes were vpon examination sent to the Tower: the murther came out by the diligent search made by the mother of the childe; eighteene of them were hanged; the other remained long in prison. In the seuenth of Ed. the first, the Iewes at Northampton crucified a Christian boy vpon Goodfriday, but did not throughly kill him. For the which fact many Iewes at London after Easter, were drawne at horse tailes and hanged. Not long after this, to wit, in the eighteenth yeare of this kings raigne, all the Iewes were banished out of England, the number of which so expul∣sed, was fifteene thousand and threescore persons; to whom was giuen no more money, but onely to beare their charges, vntill they were out of the kingdome. The rest, both goods and lands, was seised vpon for the Kings vse. But to returne backe againe to the story of the martyred boy, in deroga∣tion and despite of Christian Religion. . Paris. . codem. Vpon the day of the Kalends of August, 1223. Ann. Reg. Hen. 3: the body of a young boy, in the Church-yard of S. Benet at Paules-wharfe, was found buried, vnder whose paps certaine Hebrew letters were inscribed: vpon his body diuers prints, markes, cuts, and rents, caused by rods and whip-cords, besides many other signes of various torments, by the said boy sustained, were easie to be discerned. The name of the boy was found out by those Characters; and withall, how that hee was sold by his Christian parents: but by whom, or to which of the Iewes hee was sold, or to what end, could neuer be knowne. Howsoeuer it was concluded, that the buyers of the boy intended to haue had him crucified. Yet crucified he was not; in regard no print of the nailes, either in his hands or feet, or any wound in his side appeared. Many miracles were said to be wrought at the graue, and by the reliques of this young innocent Martyr. Whereupon the Canons of Saint Pauls Church, tooke forcibly away the sacred remaines of this holy Martyr, out of the said Church-yard, and solemnly enshrined them in their owne Church, not farre from the high Altar. Pardon Church-yard. Thomas More Deane of Pauls On the North side of this Church was sometime a great Cloyster, inui∣roning a plot of ground, called, Pardon Church-yard, whereof Thomas More, Deane of Pauls, was either the first builder, or an especiall benefactor, and was therein buried. In this Cloyster were buried many persons; some of worship, and some of honour. The Monuments of whom (saith Stow in his suruay of London) in number and curious workmanship, passed all other that were in the great Church. About the Cloyster, was artificially and richly painted the dance of Death, Dance of Pauls commonly called, the dance of Pauls, the Picture of death leading all estates▪ Chappell in Pard Church yard. Gilbert Becket Portgraue of London In the midst of this Pardon Church-yard, was a faire Chappell, first founded by Gilbert Becket (Portgraue and principall Magistrate (as now the Lord Maior is) of this Citie, father of Tho. Becket the Martyr, Arch∣bishop of Canterbury) who was therein buried; in the raigne of King Stephen. Thomas More Deane of Pauls, before mentioned, reedified, or new builded this Chappell, and founded three Chaplaines there in the raigne of Henry the fifth. Stow Sur. in Faring. Ward : In the yeare 1549. on the tenth of Aprill, the said Chappell, by com∣mandement of Edward Duke of Somerset, Lord Protector, was begun to be pulled downe, with the whole Cloyster, the Tombes and Monuments: so that nothing of them was left, but the bare plot of ground, which is since conuerted into a garden, for the Petty Canons. There was a Chappell at the North doore of Pauls, founded by Walter Sherington, Chappel at the North doore of Paul . Chancellour of the Duchie of Lancaster, by licence of King Henry the sixth, for two, three, or foure Chaplaines, indowed with fourty pound by the yeare. This Chappell was also pulled downe, in the raigne of Edward the sixth, at the commandement of the said Protector; and in place thereof an house builded. There was on the North side of Pauls Churchyard, Charnell-house with our Ladies Chap¦pell. a large charnell-house for the bones of the dead, and ouer it a Chappell, founded vpon this occasion as followeth. In the yeare 1282. the tenth of Edward the first, it was agreed, that Henry Walleis, Maior, and the Citizens, for the cause of Shops by them builded, without the wall of the Church-yard, should assigne to God, and to the Church of Saint Paul, ten Markes of rent by the yeare for euer, to∣wards the new building of a Chappell of the blessed Virgine Mary, and al∣so to assigne fiue Markes of yearely rent to a Chaplaine to celebrate there. And in the yeare 1430. the 8. of Henry the sixth, licence was granted to Ienken Carpenter, Towne-clerke of London (Executour to Richard Whittington ) to establish vpon the said Charnell, a Chaplaine to haue eight Markes by the yeare. There was also in this Chappell two Brother∣hoods. Sir Henry Barton knight (the sonne of Henry Barton of Mildenhall in Suffolcke) Lord Maior of London, Sir Hen. Barton Sir George Mirfin knight Rob Barton in the yeare 1427. Robert Barton, and Sir Thomas Mirfin knight (sonne to George Mirfin of Ely in Cambridge∣shire) Lord Maior of this Citie, the yeare 1518. were entombed with their pourtraitures of Alabaster ouer them, grated, or coped about with iron, before the said Chappell; all which with many other Tombes ann Monu∣ments of the dead, were pulled downe, together with the said Chappell; at the commandement likewise of the forenamed Duke of Somerset. The bones of the dead couched vp in the Charnell-house, vnder the Chappell, were conuayed from thence into Finsbery field, amounting to more then a thousand cart load (saith Stow ) and there laid on a moorish ground; in short space after raised, by soilage of the Citie vpon them, to beare three Mills. The Chappell and charnell-house were conuerted to dwelling houses, warehouses, and sheds before them for Stationers in place of the Tombes. Neare vnto this Chappell was a bell house with foure Bells, Bell-house in Pauls Church∣yard. the great∣est in London, they were called Iesus Bells, and belonged to Iesus Chappell, the same had a great spire of timber, couered with lead, with the image of Saint Paul on the top; which was pulled downe by Sir Miles Partridge knight, in the raigne of Henry the eight. The common speech then was (saith Stow ) that this Sir Miles Partridge did set an hundred pound vpon a cast at dice against it, and so wonne the said Bell-house and Bells of the King: and then caused the Bells to bee broken as they hung, and the rest pulled downe. This Sir Miles was hanged on the Tower-hill the 26. of February, in the sixth yeare of Edward the sixth, for matters concerning the Duke of Somerset: howsoeuer guiltlesse of any offence, either against the king, or his Councell, as he tooke it vpon his death. There was a faire Chappell of the holy Ghost, on the North side of Pauls Church, Holmes Col∣ledge. founded in the yeare 1400. by Roger Holmes, Chancellour and Prebendary of Pauls, for seuen Chaplaines, and called Holmes Colledge. Their common Hall was in Pauls Church-yard on the South side. This Colledge was suppressed in the raigne of Ed. the sixth. In this Chappell were buried Adam de Bury, Alderman, and Lord Maior of London, Adam de Bury Lord Maior Anne Duchesse of Bedford. in the yeare 1364. Anne, the daughter of Iohn, Duke of Burgundy, the first wife of Iohn Plantaginet (third sonne of king Henry the fourth) Duke of Bedford, who died in the yeare 1433. Poultneys Chappell. Sir Iohn Poultney knight, foure times Maior of London, in the yeare 1337. builded a faire Chappell on the North side of Pauls Church; where∣in he was buried. He founded a Colledge in the Parish Church of Saint Laurence, Sir Iohn Poult∣ney. called Poultney. Hee builded the Parish Church of little Alhal∣lowes in Thames street, and the Carmelite Friers Church in Couentrey. He gaue releefe in Newgate, and in the Fleet; and ten shillings a yeare to Saint Giles Hospitall by Oldborne for euer. And other Legacies (saith Stow, speaking of the Honour of Citizens) too long to rehearse. He died about the yeare 1348 But of him I haue spoken somewhat before. Vnder the Quire of Pauls, is a large Chappell, dedicated to the name of Iesu, Iesus Chappell. by whom founded I do not know. But it was thus confirmed in the 37. of Hen. the sixth, as appeareth by his patent thereof, dated at Crow∣downe to this effect. Sir Alan Box∣hul knight of the Garter. Many liege-men, and Christian people, hauing begun a Fraternitie, and Guild, to the honour of the most glorious name of Iesu Christ our Sauiour, in a place called the Crowds of the Cathedrall Church of Pauls in Lon∣don, which hath continued long time peaceably, till now of late. Where∣upon they haue made request, and wee haue taken vpon vs the name and charge of the foundation, to the land of Almighty God, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost, and especially to the honour of Iesu, in whose honour the Fraternitie was begun, &c. It was likewise confirmed by Hen. the 7. the 22. of his raigne, and by H. 8. the 27. of his raigne. In this Chappell lieth buried, Margaret the eldest daughter and coheire of Richard Beauchampe, Earle of Warwicke, second wife of Iohn, Lord Talbot (the Terrour of France) first of that Surname, Earle of Shrewsbury: But of her I haue spoken before. Many haue beene here interred, as Iohn of London, vnder the North∣roode, 1266. Iohn Louell; Iohn of Saint Olaue, and Sir Allen Boxhul ; with others, as you may reade in the Suruay of London. This Sir Allen Boxhul was knight of the Garter, in Edward the thirds dayes, and neare vpon the first foundation of that honourable order. He was Constable of the Tower, custos of the Forest, and Parke of Clarendon, the Forest of Brokholt, Grouell, and Melchet, a man highly in fauour with the said king Edward. Hee was buried by Saint Erkenwalds shrine; about the yeare 1380. And here I think it will not bee vnfitting to set downe the number of the Shrines sacred to the honour of diuers Saints in the Cathedrall Church, as they stood in the yeare 1245. Shrines in S. Pauls. Ex. Mss. in bib. Cot. First, the Shrine of S. Erkenwald, which was very sumptuous, the fourth Bishop of this See, which stood in the East part of the Church aboue the high Altar. The Shrine of S. Mellitus, first Bishop of this Diocesse, afterwards of Canterbury. The Shrine of Richard Fitz-Neile, Bishop of London, Ann. 1189. The Shrine of Egwolphe, or Egtulphe here Bishop, all beset with pre∣cious stones, he was the seuenth Bishop of this Diocesse, as then called Bi∣shop of the East Angles. He was a learned man, and so shewed himselfe in the Conuocation holden by Cuthbert, Archbishop of Canterbury, Ann. 747. There was also a glorious Shrine, super magnum Altare, but to whose holinesse dedicated I do not reade. Here sometimes was a Shrine, with a portable coffin, in the same place where Sir William Cockaines Tombe is erected; with an Altar, built to the honour of God, the blessed Virgine, S. Laurence, and all Saints; by one Ro∣ger Waltham, Precentour of the Church, as did appeare by this Inscripti∣on following, which was legible, though somewhat erazed, before the ere∣ction of the foresaid Monument. Hoc Altare in honore Dei, & beate Virginis Marie Matris eius, ac Sancti Laurentij Martyris, & omnium Sanctorum construxit, & hanc Voltam cum adiacentibus picturis Martyris et Ymaginum in Septis ereis hic posuit: & cum duabus Caglarijs suis per perpetuum .... Dominus Rogerus Waltham, hu∣ius Ecclesie Precent........pro salute anime sue, et pro salute anime Regine ...... & omnium ........ Amen. There was likewise a Chantrie with an Altar sacred to the blessed Vir∣gine Mary, contiguous to the Bishops pallace, and the body of the Church, founded by Sir Gerard Braybroke knight, Edmund Hamden, Iohn Boys, Es∣quires, and Roger Albrighton, Clerke: for one Chantrie Priest daily to say Masse, and pray for the soule of Robert Braybroke, Bishop of London, then liuing, and for his soule whensoeuer he should passe out of this world. For he soule of Nicholas Braybroke, late Canon of this Church: and for the soules of all the faithfull departed. As may appeare by these Deeds follow∣ing, copied out of the originals, vnder seale, in the custodie of Sir Simonds Dewes, knight. Omnibus Christi fidelibus ad quos presens scriptum peruenerit.

I gather by the premisses, howsoeuer I may be mistaken, I confesse, that the Court of Delegates is kept at this day, in the very place of the old Chantrie. Many Chantries, Chappels, Oratories, Altars and Shrines, more then I haue notice of, were erected, honoured and founded within the spacious vast Fabricke of this Episcopall Chaire: the beauty whereof is so magnifi∣cent (saith Malmesbury ) that it deserueth to be numbered in the ranke of most excellent Edifices. Camd. in Mid. It containeth in length sixe hundred and ninetie foot; the breadth thereof is one hundred and thirtie foot; the height of the West arched roofe from the ground, carrieth an hundred and two foot: and the new Fabricke from the ground is fourescore and eight foot high. The stone-worke of the Steeple from the plaine ground riseth in height two hundred and threescore foot: and the timber frame vpon the same is two hundred seuenty foure foot high, &c. It was no lesse then fiue hundred and foure and thirty foot high from the ground, before that in the yeare of our Lord, 1087. it was set on fire with lightning, and burnt with a great part of the Citie. Nostre Dame, the Cathedrall Church in Paris, is much spoken of for her magnitude, whose dimensions are there engrauen to shew the greatnesse thereof, in these verses following. Si tu veux scauoir comme est ample De Nostre Dame le grand Temple: Il a dans oeuure pour le seur; Dix et sept toises de haulteur, Sur la largeur de vingt quatre Et soixante cinq sans rabattre, A de long. Aux tours hault montee Trente quatre sont bien comptees Le tout fondé sur pilotis, Ainsi vray que ie te le dis. Thus, in effect, in English. If you would know the greatnesse of the great Church of our Lady, the roofe thereof is seuenteene fathome high; it is twenty and foure fathome broad, sixtie and fiue fathome long; the two Steeples are thirtie and foure fathome high aboue the Church, and all founded vpon piles. Now I leaue it to my Reader (taking a fathome for an Ell) to make the difference betwixt the ample extensure of these two religious structures. Since the building and foundation of this Church and Bishopricke of London by King Ethelbert (which is much-what about a thousand and twenty sixe yeares ago) eightie and nine Bishops haue succeeded one ano∣ther in this Hierarchie or holy gouernance, which at this day is right wor∣thily ruled, ouerseene, and guided by the right reuerend Father in God, and prudent States-man, William La d, one of his Maiesties most honou∣rable priuie Councell. And thus I will take leaue of this sacred Edifice, and make a few steps downe into the Parish Church of Saint Faith ; commonly called, S. Faiths vnder Pauls ; wherein I do no finde any ancient funerall Inscription much remarkable, excepting one engrauen vpon the marble, which couers the body of one William West, a Canon of Saint Pauls, a Cardinall of the same Church, a good companion, a man vniuersall, affable, and curteous, a Fel∣low of faire demeanour amongst his Brotherhood, as hee is here stiled to his great commendation. Now a word or two before I set downe his Epitaph, of the title of Car∣dinall; Which is deriued from the Latine word Cardo, the hooke or hing of a doore: for as the doore hangs and depends on the hinges, so the Church on the Cardinalls. Or veluti Cardine regitur ostium, ita Ecclesia regitur bono eorum consilio : As the doore is ruled by its Hinges, so the Church is gouerned by their good counsell. They are also accounted, by some, ho∣nourable increasers, Dierius & alij. Rulers and preseruers of all such matters which con∣duce to Christian pietie, and the defence of the Bishops power and au∣thoritie. In the See of Rome, at this day, they haue the chiefest charge, and are di∣uided into three orders, that is to say, of Bishops, Priests, and Deacons: not that the Cardinals Priests be no Bishops, or that the Deacons be not Priests and Bishops, but for that their first institution was such, some to carrie the titles of Bishops, others of Priests, and some of Deacons. The Cardinalls which are Bishops, sit neare vnto the Pope, when hee doth celebrate Festiuall dayes: The Cardinalls Priests assist him when he saith Masse: and the Deacons attire him, and serue him at the Altar. They haue there their Colledge, whereof the Pope is head; the number of them hath not beene certaine in our dayes: at this time there are about sixty and eight; although we find that in former ages, they were but twelue, after the example of the Apostles: They assemble themselues together once or twice a weeke, as affaires of importance come to their considerations; and this their assemblie is called the Consistory; where they treat (or at least they ought to treat) of all things▪ which belong vnto the faith and Reli∣gion; to the peace of Christians, and to the preseruation of the temporall estate of the Church. I finde nothing of Cardinalls vntill the dayes of Gregory the Great. Quo tempore Episcopi indifferenter Cardinales faciebant, Sir Hen. Spel∣man. Gloss. li . C. et Papa Cardinales in Episcopos promouebat. Yet some are of opinion, that the first beginning of Cardinals was in the time of Pontianus the Pope, which was circa Ann. 231. and Marcellus after him, circa Ann. 304. ordained fifteene, or rather twenty fiue Cardinals in the Citie of Rome, propter Baptismata et sepultu∣ras hominum. And when as first these Cardinals were instituted in the Ro∣mane Church, Pauperculi erant Romae in suis titulis habitantes. They were poore and necessitous, liuing at Rome in their owne titles. And Gregory the Great, in one of his Epistles to Maximian the Bishop of Syracusa, writes the like of the pouertie of one Felix, a Deacon Cardi∣nall. For whose sustentation he thus prouides. Regist. lib. 3. Epist. 14. Sustentationem eius pietatis intuitu prouidentes, in tua Ecclesia Syracu∣sana, eum prenidimus cardinandùm, &c. siue vt officium Diaconatus expleat, se certe vt solae eiusdem officij, pro sustentanda paupertate sua, commoda con∣sequatur. Howsoeuer then, that the Cardinals of Rome at this day doe abound in all affluence of riches; and like stately Cedars, looke ouer the smaller sprigs of the Clergie: yet considering the Primitiue times, our Cardinals of Saint Pauls are not to be contemned for their meane competencie of liuely hood: hauing sufficient to maintaine their reuerent comportment. Of whom giue me leaue to speake a little out of the Records of the Church. Cardinals of S. Paul. The Church of Saint Paul had before the time of the Conquerour, two Cardinalls, which office still continues. They are chosen by the Deane and Chapter, out of the number of the twelue petty Canons, and are called Cardinales chori: the Cardinals of the Quire. Horum officium est circumspicere quotidie & notare omnia in choro de∣licta & peccata, Church. &c. Their office is to take notice of the absence or neglect of all the Quire, and weekely to render accompt thereof to the Deane and Chapter. Hi duo etiam Cardinales Ministris Ecclesie & Seruis eorum um sanis t m egrotis Ecclesiastica ministrant Sacramenta. These two Cardinals doe minister Ecclesiasticall Sacraments to the Mi∣nisters of the Church and their seruants, as well to the healthfull as to the sicke. Con essiones audiant & penitentias iniungant salutares; Mortuos postrem conuenientibus tradunt Sepulturis. They heare Confessions, and appoint comfortable Penance: and lastly they commit the dead to conuenient Sepulture. Not any Cathedrall Church in England hath Cardinals excepting this, neither doe I finde any beyond Seas, to be dignified with this title, sauing the Churches of Rome, Rauenna, Aquileia, Millaine, Pisa, Beneuentana, in Italy, and Compostella in Spaine. These Cardinals haue the best preheminence in the Quire, aboue all, next to the Subdeane, and the best Stalls. But at the length let me descend into Saint Faiths, and to the Graue-stone of my Canon and Cardinall William West. Saint Faiths Church.

Our old English writers affirme, Lud King of the Britaines. that Lud King of the Britains (whom they make to be the repairer or new builder of London) was buried much what about this place, of which these rimes following. Io. Harding. With Walles faire and Towres fresh about, His Citee great of Troynouant full faire, Full well he made, and battelled throughout. And Palays faire for Roialles to appeare, Amending other defectyue and vnfaire. From London stone to his Now the Bi∣shop of Lon∣dons house, saith Harding. Palays royall That now Ludgate is knowne ouer all. Betweene London stone and Ludgate forth right, That called was then for his name Ludstone: He made men buyld, that London then so hight; His Palays faire, then made he then anone, With toures high, both of lyme and stone, Beside Ludgate; and his Temple there thereby His God to serue, and him to glorifye. When he had reigned by fourty yere all out He died so; and in his temple faire Entombed was with stories all about. By another Author, more ancient, it is thus exprest. Rob. Glocest. Walls he let make all aboute, and yates vp and doun, And aftyr Lud that was his name he cluped it Ludstoun. The heyest yat of ye toun yat yut stant ther and is, He let hit clupie Ludgate, after his owe name iwis: He let him tho he was ded burye at thulk yate, Theruore yut after him men clupeth it Ludgate. Cadwallo K. of the Britaines. The Britaines record that Cadwallo called the Valiant, King of the Bri∣taines, after he had raigned in great honour the space of 48 yeeres, died in peace the 12 of Nouember, An. 677. and was buried in this place. Whose Image great and terrible, Ge ay Mon. triumphantly riding on horse-backe, being artifi∣cially cast in brasse, the Britaines placed here vpon Ludgate, to the further feare and terrour of the Saxons; the greatnesse of which King is thus fur∣ther exprest. Harding. King Cadwall reyned full hele againe In Britayne land, as prime without pere Aboue English, as Lord Souerayne Ouer Saxons, Scottes, and Peights clere And English also as clere did appere. A little more of this noble King Cadwall, out of my old Author Robert of Gloucester. When Cadewall kyng of Brutons nobly ynough Had regnyd xlviii. yer, toward his deth he drogh. He dede aftyr Martyn Masse euen the sixt dey. The Brutons made deel ynough tho he ded ley, Hii made a Kyngys toome, and hym al hol wyth ynne Upon an horse ridyng of bras put al wyth gynne.

In whyche yat men shold goddys seruyse do, And sing for his soul, and al Christene also. Farewell my freyndes, Iohn Benson and Anne his wife. the tyde abydeth no man, We be departed fro hence, and so all yee: But in this passage, the best song that we say can, Is Requiem eternam, now Iesu grant hit mee, When wee haue endyd all our aduersitee, Grant vs in Paradise to haue a mansion, That sh ed his blood for our redemption▪ Therfore wee tendyrlie requier yee, For the souls of Iohn Benson, And Anne his wyff, of your charitie, To say a Pater Noster and an Aue. These verses following were engrauen in copper on the strong Quadrant of Ludgate, built by Stephen Foster Lord Maior, and Dame Agnes his wife, for the reliefe of the Prisoners. Deuout souls that passe this way, For Stephen Foster late Maior hertely pray, And Dame Agnes his Spous, to God consecrate. That this hous made for Londoners in Ludgate. So that for lodging and water Prisoners here nought pay As the kepers shall all ansqueare at dreadfull Doomys day. Christ Church. The chiefe Foundresse of this religious house is said to be Queene Mar∣garet, The foundati∣on of Christ-Church or the Friers Mino∣rites. Margaret the wife of King Ed. 1. the second wife of Edward the first, sister of Philip the fourth, sur∣named the Faire, King of France, and eldest daughter of King Philip the hardy, sonne of S. Lewes. who died An. 1317. and was buried here before the high Altar. Iohn de Dreux, (second sonne of Iohn Duke of Britaine, by Beatrice his wife, daughter of King Henry the third) Earle of Britaine and Richmond, gaue 300 l. to the building of some part of the Church; glased all the win∣dowes on the south side, and also gaue many rich Iewels and ornaments to be vsed in the same, so that he is accounted as a second Founder. Diuers other Noble men and worthy Citizens, gaue both lands and great summes of money towards the building and endowing of this religi∣ous Structure; which was finished within 21 yeeres, dedicated to the ho∣nour of God, and our alone Sauiour Iesu Christ, and replenished with grey Fryers Minorites; valued at the generall suppression but at 32 l. 19 s. 10 d. This Abbey Church hath beene honoured with the sepulture of foure Queenes, foure Dutchesses, foure Countesses, one Duke, two Earles, eight Barons, and some thirty fiue Knights; whose names are set downe by Stow in his Suruay of this honourable Citie; gist Frat. Mi . Mss. in bib C t. and in all, from the first foundation vnto the dissolution, sixe hundred sixtie and hree persons of Qualitie were here interred. In the Quire were nine Tombes of Alabaster and Marble, in∣uironed with barres or strikes of iron: one Tombe in the body of the Church coped also with iron, and seauenscore graue-stones of Marble in di∣uers places; all which were pulled downe, taken away, and sold for fiftie pounds or thereabouts, by Sir Martin Bowes Maior of London, An. 1545. The rest of the Monuments are now wholly defaced, not any one remaining at this day, saue such which are of later times. The blacke Fryers. The foundati∣on of the blacke in vita R K. chi piscopi. This House was founded by Robert Kilwardby Archbishop of Canter∣bury, and the Citizens of London, An. Dom. 1276. This Archbishop, to∣wards the latter end of his time, made a collection, saith Godwin, for the building of a Monasterie for the Fryer Minors in London. Many contri∣buted so largely thereunto, as he (hauing the helpe of a certaine old Tower which yeelded him stones without charge) finished the same with other mens money, and was able to affoord the foundation for another at Salis∣bury. King Edward the first and Eleanor his wife, were great Benefactors to this worke. This was a large Church, richly furnished with ornaments, and honoured by the burials of many great Personages: diuers Parliaments and other great meetings haue beene holden in this Monasterie, which is now altogether demolished, and other new buildings erected in the same place. This order of blacke Fryers Predicants were remoued hither from Oldbourne, where they had continued 55 yeeres. The reuenewe of this house was valued at 104 l. 15 s. 5 d per annum, being surrendred into the Kings hands, 12 of Nouember, the 30 of Henry the 8. Suruey of London. Persons of kingly, princely, and noble descent, of eminent high place and qualitie, to the number of fiftie and vpwards are reckoned by Io. Stow (out of the Register of this house) to haue bin here entombed, to whose re∣lation I leaue my Reader, onely giue me leaue to speake of one. Vpon a Table fastened to a pillar, this inscription was not long since here to be read, as I haue it out of the collections of Tho. Talbot. Elizabeth Countesse of Northampton. Here lyeth the body of the Lady Elizabeth, the daughter of Sir Bartho∣lomew Balitismere, wife of William Bohun, Earle of Northampton, and mo∣ther of the Earles of March and Northampton, and of Elizabeth, Coun∣tesse of Arundell.

This Col∣ledge claimed great priuiledges of sanctuarie, and other Franchises, as ap∣peareth in a booke written by a Notary of that house, Lib. S. Martin. circa An. 1442. This Colledge was surrendred to King Edward the sixt in the second of his raigne, Stow Sur. and in the same yeere, the Colledge Church was pulled downe, and a Wine-Tauerne built in the place, which continues to this day.

Here lieth buried (saith Stow ) the head of Iames the fourth, King of Scots, whose body bowelled, rebollowed, embalmed and inclosed in lead, was conuayed from Flodden Field (where he was slaine in battell, The head of Iames the 4. king of Scot∣land. Stow. Annal. the ninth of September being Friday, 1513.) by Thomas Howard, Earle of Surry, Lieutenant Generall of the English Army, to this Citie of London, presen∣ted to Queene Katherine, and from hence sent to the Monastery of Shine in Surrey, where it was regally interred. Since the dissolution of which house, in the dayes of king Edward the sixth, I haue beene shewed (saith hee) the same body so wrapped in lead, Suruay Lond. throwne into a waste roome, amongst old timber, stone, lead, and other rubble: and further (to shew the occasion of the buriall of his head, here in this Church) he declareth, that the seruants of Lancelot Young, Glasier to the late Queene Elizabeth, being at Shine, in new glasing the windowes, either vpon a foolish pleasure, or desire of the lead, cut the head from the rest; but smelling the sweete per∣fumes of the balmes, gaue it to their Master; who opening the head, found therein the head of a man retaining fauour; though the moysture were cleane dried vp, whose haire both of Head and Beard was red: which, af∣ter he had well viewed, and a while kept, he caused to bee buried in Saint Michaels Woodstreet, London, the Church of the Parish wherein himselfe dwelled. That the Head of this valorous King lieth here inhumed, wee must be∣leeue the words of the Relator; for I finde no Monument or outward appa∣rance of it in the Church. That his body (not found till the day after the battell, and then not knowne or descried, because of his many wounds, saue onely by the Lord Dacres ) was interred amongst the Carthusians in the Priory of Shine at Richmond, I haue, out of an old Manuscript, the testimony of a man which saw his Sepulchre, the same yeare of his death in the said religious house: these are his words, out of the Lieger booke of Whalley Abbey.

Qui vidit testimonium perhibuit Et verum est testimonium eius: Yet notwithstanding all this, Iohn Lesley, Io. Lesle in vil. Iac. 4. Bishop of Rosse, affirmeth that it was held for certaine, that the body thus found by the Lord Dacres, was the body of the Laird Bonehard, then slaine in the battell: and that King Iames was seene aliue the same night at Kelso, whence he passed to Ierusa∣lem, and there spent the rest of his dayes in holy contemplation. And ano∣ther of later times also affirmeth the place of this kings buriall to bee as yet vnknowne. Remaines, pa. 371. King Henry the eight (saith hee) who subuerted so many Churches, Monuments and Tombes, lyeth inglorious at Windsor, and neuer had the honour, either of the Tombe which hee had prepared, or of any Epitaph that I now remember. But his Brother in law King Iames the fourth of Scotland, slaine at Flodden, though the place of his buriall is vn∣knowne, yet had this honourable Epitaph. Fama orbem replet, mortem sors occulit, at tu Desine scrutari quod tegit ossa solum. Si mihi dent animo non impar fata Sepulchrum, Augusta est tumulo terra Britanna meo. And Iohn Ionston in his Historicall Inscriptions of the Scottish Kings, confirmes the same opinion of the vncertaintie of the place of this Kings interrement. Reade, if you please, the verses of that worthy man (Professor of Diuinitie in the Vniuersitie of Saint Andrewes Scotland) to the same effect; and greatly in this kings commendation. Iacobus 4.

Saint Mary Aldermanbury. Shanke bone of 28. inches long. In the Cloister about this Churchyard, hanged and fastened to a post is the shanke-bone of a man, wondrous great, and large, in length 28. inches and a halfe, of assise: with the pourtraiture of a Giant-like person, vpon a Table, with this Inscription. In wise mens sight I seeme not strange, Although some friends of Pan will scorne; From time to time all shapes will change, Full well appeares since the first-borne. Deride not that which nought offends, Let reason rule, strong men haue beene; As Sampson tall; loe death all ends: In Stories past may well be seene. Cam en in Cornwall. If you trust our Stories, you must beleeue that Giants, or men of vaste bodily composture, inhabited this our Island in former times. Of whom one Hauillan a Poet, who flourished aboue foure hundred yeares since, wrote pleasantly in this wise, thus translated out of the Latine tongue. In Cornwall There Gyants whilome dwelt, whose clothes were skins of beasts, Whose drinke was bloud; whose cups, to serue for vse at feasts, Were made of hollow wood; whose beds were bushie thornes; And Lodgings rockie caues, to shelter them from stormes. Their chambers craggie rocks, their hunting found them meat. To rauish and to kill, to them was pleasure great. Their violence was rule, with rage and furie led, They rusht into the fight, and fought hand ouer head. Their bodies were interr'd behinde some bush or brake: To beare such monstrous wights, the earth did grone and quake. These pesterd most the Westerne tract: more feare made thee agast, O Cornwall, vtmost doore that art to let in Zephyrus blast. And the vulgar receiued opinion is, that Brute vpon his first arriuall in Kent, was encountred with diuers strong and mightie Giants. Of which an Author of reuerend good antiquitie thus writeth: as also of the wrastling betwixt Corineus and Gogmagog. R b Glocest. Ther was a Geant het Gogmagog, yat was gret and strong, For aboute ane twenty fet men saith. seiy yat he was long: A good oke he wolde braye a doun as hit small yerde were; And bere hit forth in his hond ye folke all to a fere. wi h. He com wiy xx Geants and assayllede Brute faste, Brut wiy his power hem slough echon atte laste, Alle but Gogmagog, for hym ne slough he nought, For he sholde wiy Corneus wrastle by hys thought. In a word, my Author makes Corineus to get the vpper hand of Gog∣magog, and to cast him headlong from one of the rocks not farre from Do∣uer, which for a long time was called the fall or leape of Gogmagog, Gogmagog the last Giant. and af∣terwards the fall of Douer. And this Gogmagog, saith he, was the last of that monstrous generation. Raph the Monke of Coggeshall who wrote aboue three hundred yeares ago, saith, that in king Richards time, on the sea shore at a Village in Essex, called Eadulphnesse, were found two teeth of a certaine Giant, of such an huge bignesse, that two hundred such teeth, as men haue now a dayes, might be cut out of them. These saw I at Goggeshall (quoth he) and not without wondring. And such another Giant-like thing, I wot not what, saith Camden, Camd. in Essex. was in the beginning of Queene Elizabeths raigne, digged vp by R. Candish, a Gentleman neare to this place. Vpon which thus he doth further comment. I do not denie (saith he) but that there haue beene men, that for their huge bodies, and firme strength, were wondrous to behold; whom God, as Saint Austin saith, would haue to liue vpon the earth: thereby to teach vs, that neither beauty of bodie, nor talenesse of stature, are to bee accounted simplie good things, seeing they be common, as well to Infidels, as to the godly. Yet may we very well thinke, that which Suetonius hath written, namely, that the huge limmes of monstrous Sea-creatures elsewhere, and in this kingdome also, were commonly said and taken to haue beene Giants bones. Another iudicious Antiquarie of these times doth also thus illustrate this point. Selden in his Illu r tions, Polyol. Song 1. I could thinke, saith hee, that there now are some as great sta∣tures, as for the most part haue beene; and that Giants were but of a some∣what more then vulgar excellence in body, and martiall performance. If you obiect the finding of great bones, which measured by proportion large∣ly exceed our times. I first answer, that in some singulars, as Monsters ra∣ther then naturall, such proofe hath beene; but that now and of ancient time, the eyes iudgement in such like hath beene, and is, subiect to much imposture, mistaking bones of huge beasts for humane. Claudius brought ouer his Elephants hither, and perhaps Iulius Cesar some (for I haue read that he terriblie frighted the Britons, with sight of one at Coway Stakes, when he passed ouer Thames) and so may you bee deceiued. But more of Giants hereafter. Saint Olaues Iewrie. Thomas Morsted gist ici Tho. Morsted. Dieu de salme eit merci. Amen.

Long prosperity To Charles and Henry, Princes most puissant The one of the Faith, The other of the Church Chosen defendant. These verses were depicted, Hollins. here and in other places about this Citie, the yeare 1514. when Charles the fift Emperour was here in England; to shew in what golden bands of loue these two potent Monarches were en∣linked; for that amongst other couenants (then concluded and confirmed betwixt them by corporall Oathes) one was, that the Emperour promised to stay for, and take to wife the young Princesse Lady Mary, King Hen∣ries then onely daughter, afterwards Queene of England. Why the Titles, Speed Hist. defender of the Church and Faith, were attributed vn∣to these two Princes, is vulgarlie knowne, because Charles chosen Empe∣rour, to purchase the Popes fauour, directed forth a solemne Writ of Out∣lawry against Martin Luther, who then had giuen a great blow to the Pa∣pall Crowne; And King Henry likewise was renowned in Rome, for wri∣ting a booke against the said Luther ; vnderpropping the tottering or downe-cast countenance of the Popes Pardons, which Luther shrewdly had shaken. The Pope therefore, to shew himselfe a kinde Father vnto these his sonnes, gaue them these Titles; which were in truth none other, then the same which they sware vnto, when the Crownes of their Empires were first set vpon their heads.

Camden in the County of Tipperary. Ire∣land. The Ancestors of these Earles (saith learned Camden ) were in old time the Butlers (an honourable office) in Ireland, and from thence came this Surname Le Boteler or Butler imposed vpon them▪ and certaine it is that they were linked in most neere alliance vnto Saint Thomas Becket Archbi∣shop of Canterbury (as who deriue their descent from his sister) (which was a great motiue to make them choose this place for their buriall) and that after he was murdered, Becket was borne neere to this Church, here he had a shrine, and his picture ouer the Chappell dore. they were by King Henry the second remoued into Ireland, who supposed that he should disburden himselfe of the worlds hatred, for that fact, in case hee aduanced the Kinsfolke and Allies of the said Thomas to rich reuenues, and high honours. The first Earle of Ormond (saith he) in this familie, was Iames, sonne to Edmund, Earle of Caricke, who wedded the daughter of Humphrey Bohun Earle of Hereford, whom he had by a daughter of King Edward the first. And here was his first step vnto this honour; hereupon Iames his sonne by this marriage, came to be commonly named among the people, The noble Earle. The fifth Earle of these named Iames (that I may not stand particu∣larly vpon euere one) receiued at the hands of King Henry the sixth, the ti∣tle and honour of Earle of Wiltshire, to him and to the heires of his body, who being Lord Deputie of Ireland, as diuers others of this race, and Lord Treasurer of England; standing attainted by King Edward the fourth, was streight waies apprehended and beheaded: but his brethren, Iohn and Thomas likewise proclaimed Traitors, kept themselues close out of the way.

With this Epitaph made by himselfe a little before his death. Wilingly haue I sought, and willingly haue I found, The fatall end that wrought thither as dutie bound: Discharg'd I am of that I ought to my countrey by honest wound. My soule departyd Christ hath bought: the end of man is ground. This familie of the Blunts is noble and ancient, Camd. in Shrop. surnamed so at the first of the yellow haire of their head; Blunt signifying so in the Norman lan∣guage; they greatly flourished at Kinlet in Shropshire, and by Elwaston in Darbishire, Camd. in Dar∣bishire. where Sir Raph Mountioy had lands in the time of Edward the first: from whence came Sir Walter Blunt, whom King Edward the fourth aduanced to the honour of Baron Mountioy, with a pension. Whose poste∣ritie haue equalled the Nobilitie of their birth, with the ornaments of lear∣ning; and principally amongst them, Charles late Earle of Deuonshire de∣ceased; Baron Mountioy, Lord Lieutenant generall of Ireland, and knight of the honourable order of the Garter: whose sonne Mountioy Blunt enioy∣eth his lands: who by the speciall fauour of our late Soueraigne King Iames was created Baron of Montioy in the North of Ireland. Here also lieth bu∣ried William Blunt, Lord Mountioy, who died but of later times. Saint Martius Vintrie.

This Richard Lion here interred (whose corporall proportion is engra∣uen wondrous curiously vpon his Graue-stone) was a famous Wine-mer∣chant, a skilfull Lapidarie, sometime Sheriffe of London. Hee was drawne and hailed out of his owne house by Wat. Tyler and other Rebels, and by them beheaded in Cheape, the yeare 1381. Not many yeares since, here stood a monument in the North wall, ere∣cted to the memory of Sir George Stanley, Knight of the Garter, and Lord Strange (in right of his wife Ioan, daughter and heire of Iohn Lord Strange of Knocking) sonne and heire of Thomas Stanley, Lord Stanley of Lathum in Lancashire and Earle of Derby: which George died before his Father at Derby house (now the Heralds Office) Anno 1487. the third of Henry the seuenth. And neere to the same place Elianor his mother Countesse of Der∣by, the daughter of Richard Neuill Earle of Salisbury, was likewise en∣tombed. This Church was honoured with the monuments of many wor∣thy personages, of which no mention is now remayning. Saint Michaels Pater Noster in the Royall. This Church was new builded, The Founda∣tion of Whit¦tin on C l∣ledge nd Hospitall. and made a Colledge of S. Spirit and S. Mary, founded by Richard Whitington Mercer foure times Maior, for a Master, foure Fellowes, Masters of Art, Clarkes, Conducts, Quiristers, &c. and an Almes house, called Gods house, or Hospitall for thirteene poore men, one of them to be Tutor, and to haue xvi.d. the weeke, the other twelue, each of them to haue xiiij. d. the weeke for euer, with other neces∣sary prouisions. These were bound to pray for the good estate of Richard Whitington and Alice his wife, their Founders, and for Sir William Whi∣tington Knight, and Dame Ioan his wife, and for Hugh Fitz-Warren, and Dame Maud his wife, the Fathers and Mothers of the said Richard Whi∣tington, and Alice his wife; Stow Suruey. for King Richard the second, and Thomas of Woodstocke, Duke of Glocester, speciall Lords and promoters of the said Richard Whitington. The licence for this foundation was granted by King Henry the fourth, the eleuenth of his raigne, and confirmed by King Henry the sixt, the third of his raigne. This Richard Whitington (saith my Author Stow ) was three times buried in this his owne Church: first by his Execu∣tors vnder a faire monument, then in the raigne of Edward the sixt; the Parson of the Church thinking some great riches (as hee said) to be buried with him, Richard Whit∣ ing thrice bu∣ried. caused his monument to be broken, his body to be spoyled of his leaden sheet, and againe the second time to be buried. And in the raigne of Queene Mary, the Parishioners were forced to take him vp, to lap him in lead as afore, to bury him the third time, and to place his monument or the like ouer him againe: whereupon this Epitaph is engrauen, partly erazed and imperfect. Vt fragrans Nardus fama fuit iste Richardus, Albisicans villam; qui iuste rexerat illam. Flos Mercatorum, Fundator presbiterorum. Sic & Egenorum, testis sit cetus eorum.

Martius hunc vicit, en Annos gens tibi dicit Finijt ipse dies sis sibi christe quies. Amen. Eius sponsa pia generosa probata Sophia, Iungitur. This Whitington flourished in the raigne of King Richard the second. Henry the fourth, Henry the fift, and died about the beginning of Henry the sixt, hauing begun to build Newgate, and the Librarie of Gray Friers at Christ Church, London, with that at Guild hall; all which were finished by his Executors, with his goods. His Colledge here, was suppressed by the Statute of Edward the sixt: the Almes houses, with the poore men, doe remaine to this day, and are paid by the Mercers. Alhallowes the great.

Saint Michaels Crooked lane. . Here lieth entombed in a Chappell of his owne foundation, Sir William Walworth Knight, Lord Maior of London, whose manfull prowesse against that arch-Rebell VVat Tyler and his confederates, is much commended in our English Chronicles: his monument was shamefully defaced in the raigne of King Edward the sixt (as many others were) but since it was re∣newed by the Fishmongers, he died, Anno 1383. as appeareth by this Epi∣taph. Here vnder lyth a man of Fame, William Walworth callyd by name, Fishmonger he was in life time here, And twise Lord Maior as in bookes appere, Who with courage stout and manly might, Slew Wat Tyler in King Richards sight. For which act done and trew entent, The King made him Knight incontinent. And gaue him armes, as here you see, To declare his fact and Chiualrie. He left this life the yere of our God, Thirteene hundryd fourescore and three od.

So that of him it was called, Saint Laurence Poultney, in Candlewickstreet. This Colledge was valued at 79. l. 17. s. 11. d. per ann. and surrendred in the raigne of Ed. the sixth.

Great concourse of people came hither to our Lady of Barking a pilgrimage; vntill the Colledge was suppressed and pulled downe, in the second of Edward the sixth, and the ground whereupon it stood, imployed as a Garden plot.

And Millet Monk whych cam in to this lond wyth Sent Austen was made the fyrst Bishop of London, and hys See was made in Powllys Chyrch.

The truth of this Inscription is questioned in diuers points by some of the learned Senate of our Ecclesiasticall Historians, but I will adhere to the common receiued opinion, that Lucius was the first Christian king of this Island, and indeed of the world, that he founded an Archbishops See here in London: Malmes. lib 1. de Pont. 1. Selden. after which time Christianitie was alwayes profest in some part of this kingdome, and especially in Wales. Of which, if it be not trou∣blesome, reade these old rimes. Rob Glocest. Among ye Brutons in Walys was alway Christendom, Sitthe hit furst thurghe Lucye Brutons king hit com: And that was tofore Sent Austens tyme a cccc yer And about xxiiii, as they writ of er. Iocelin of Fournes seith, that one Thean was the first Archbishop, and the first builder of this Church, by the helpe of one Cyran, chiefe Butler vnto king Lucius. Eluanus was the second, who built a Librarie neare vnto his Church, and conuerted many of the British Druides (learned men in the Pagan law) to Christianitie. The rest vntill you come to Restitutus, who was the 12. Archbishop, are but onely named in my Author. Cadar. Restitutus (saith Bishop Godwin ) was at the Councell of Arles in France, the yeare 326. O i us. vnder Constantius the sonne of Constantine the great, Conan. and subscribed vnto the Decrees of the same Councell, Palladius. which he brought ouer with him. Stephanus. One Decree amongst the rest was, that if a Deacon at the time of his ordering, Il ut. did protest he intended to marrie, Dedwin. it should be lawfull for him so to doe. Thedred. Restitus himselfe was married. One Kebius (the sonne of Salomon, Hillary. a certaine Duke of Cornwall) Bishop of Anglesey in Wales, Restitutus. Harpsfeeld Sex. prim. secul c. 16. flou∣rished in his dayes, and trauelled with him into France; and afterwards, went himselfe into Ireland: where, by his good doctrine, he conuerted ma∣ny of that Nation to Christianitie. Gwitelin. or Guitelnius. Guitelnius the thirteenth Archbishop, trauelled ouer Seas to the king of little Britaine, to craue his aide against the Scots and Picts, which mightily infested this kingdome, insomuch that the Romanes rather chose to remit the Britaines their tribute, then to afoard them any more aide. Of which, this Bishop made an oration to his countriemen a little before his depar∣ture, who at that time (like the Romanes) were wearied out with their of∣ten incursions, and altogether afraid to encounter with the enemie, that fierce valiant Scot. Scots euer valiant. Imagine his words were wondrous old, from our times, and that they were deliuered in this Dialect. Rob. Glocest. Alle ye grete of this lond to London ycome Therchbishop thus sede Gwithelin benome. Our leue frendes of Rome her to speke to yough me bede, But beter wille ich haue to wepe, then to do eny othur dede: For pite hit is of this londe, and of our wretchede.

So it followes how this Bishop went into little Britaine, and entreated Aldroennus the king there, to send ouer Constantine his brother, with a certaine number of men, by whose helpe the enemie might bee expelled, which was granted, and performed accordingly. Fastidius Priscus succeeded him in the gouernement of this See, Fastidius Pris∣cus 4. cent. 1. who writ diuers bookes of diuine learning, mentioned by Bale. Hee was a sin∣cere expositor of the sacred Scriptures, and a painefull Preacher through∣out the whole kingdome. Cui abunde suppeditebant, cum perbenigno ingenio excellens memoria: morum integritas et vita incorrupta, quibus cumulatis∣sime caeteros suae gentis praecedebat verbi Praecones. He flourished vnder Ho∣norius and Theodosius Emperours, Ternckine 15. Lib. in bib. Cott. Mss. Vedinus 16. 420. By an old namelesse Chronicle which I haue read, one Ternekine succeeded Fastidius, a piercing wise Pre∣late into matters of state, and in speciall fauour with Aurelius Ambrose King of great Britaine: but Vodinus followeth next in the catalogue, a man of singular deuotion and good life, who for reprehending King Vortigers vn∣lawfull marriage with Rowenna, Hengists daughter (his lawfull wife being then liuing) was barbarously murdered by the said Hengist, and with him many other Priests, and religious Persons, circa an. 452. After the comming of the Saxons, Godwin de prae∣ful. Ang. the succession of Archbishops was still continued in London for the space of many yeares (but secretly) euen vntill the time that S. Gregorie sent Augustine hither. I finde onely one of them named, to wit, Theonus who with Thadiocus or Tadiacus (of which I haue spoken be∣fore in Rochester) Bishop of Yorke, Theon the last Archbishop. taking their Clergie with them, got them into Wales and Cornewall, to the rest of their countrimen, whom the Saxons had lately driuen thither: this man did not write himselfe Arch∣bishop, which is one cause of some controuersie amongst our Historiogra∣phers. Saint Michaels Cornehill. Robert Fabian Sheriffe. Here lyeth Robert Fabian Alderman and Sheriffe of London, who com∣posed a laborious Chronicle of England and France, with the monuments, and the succession of the Lord Maiors of London, and died Anno Dom. 1511. for whom this Epitaph was made, now altogether defaced.

Hic ..... Willielmus Capel .... Maior Lon: Sir William Ca∣pell Lord Maior. ...fil Iohannis Capel ... Neyland in com. ... ob. ... 1509. Out of this broken Inscription I fynde this whole history how that Sir Richard Empson Knight (a Sieue-makers sonne in Tocester) and Edmund Dudley Esquire, both Lawiers, were two instruments for King Henry the seuenth, to enrich his, and their owne coffers; and to empouer sh the sub∣iects, by way of calling the richer sort into question, for breach of old, moth eaten, vnreuiued penall Lawes; amongst many others (whom they most treacherously abused, by a false packt Iurie) they scruzed from this Sir William Capell aboue sixteene hundred pounds, and some twelue or thir∣teene yeeres after, they were at him againe afresh, for two thousand pounds more; which because he would not pay, he was commanded, by Dudley, Prisoner to the Tower; but by the death of the said King (which happe∣ned the same yeere) he was released both of imprisonment and payment, in which yeere he also departed this world, in the loue of all good men, lea¦uing a great inheritance, and an honourable remembrance to his posteri¦tie; and not long after, Empson and Dudley (cater-pillers of the common-wealth, hatefull to all good people) were beheaded on the Tower hill the 17. of August 1510. leauing behinde them nothing they could dispose of for their heires, saue the staine of euerlasting infamie. He lyeth here entombed in a Chappell of his owne Foundation; he was the sonne of Iohn Capell of Stoke Neyland in the county of Suffolke. Saint Bennets Finke.

Within this Parish was the Hospitall of Saint Anthony, The foundati∣on of Saint Anthonies Hos∣pitall. sometime a cell belonging to Saint Anthonies of Vienna, founded by King Henry the third, for a Master, two Priests, one Schoolemaster, and twelue poore men: the reuenewes of this house were much augmented, and the number of the houshold increased by King Henry the sixt, and Edward the fourth, to which Iohn Tate Mercer was a right bountifull benefactor, who was here entombed vnder a faire monument, he died Anno 1514. and so was VVater Champion Sheriffe of London, 1529. who was here buried. The lands, by yeare, of this Hospitall, were valued in the 37. yeare of Henry the eight, to be 55 l. sixe shillings, 8 d.

The foundati∣on of the Au∣gustine Friers. This religious house was founded (in the well meaning deuotion of for∣mer times) by Humphrey Bohun the fift of that name, Earle of Hereford and Essex, 1253. and was afterward reedified by Humphrey Bohun, the ninth of that name, Earle of Hereford and Essex, Lord of Brecknocke, and Consta∣ble of England, who died Anno 1361. and was buried in the Quire of this Church.

Here sometime did lie entombed the body of Richard Fitz-Alan, the fourth of that name, Earle of Arundell and Surrey, who with Thomas Duke of Glocester, Thomas Earle of Warwicke, Henry Earle of Derby, after∣wards King of England, and others, combined and sware each to other, against Robert Vere, Duke of Ireland, and Michael de la Pole Duke of Suf∣folke, for abusing and misleading the King; for which and some other cau∣ses which Richard the second obiected against them, some of them were banished, others condemned to perpetuall imprisonment: and this Richard beheaded on the Tower hill, Septemb. Anno 1397. the constancie of whose carriage at his arraignement, passage and execution (in all which he did not once discolour the honour of his bloud with any degenerous word, looke, or action) encreased the enuy of his death vpon his prosecutors. Iohn Vere Earle of Ox∣ford▪ and Au∣brey his sonne. Here likewise lay sumptuously interred, Iohn Vere the xii. Earle of Ox∣ford, and Aubrey his eldest sonne, who with Sir Thomas Tudensa knight, (who was also here buried) and others their Councellors (either through malice of their enemies, or some offence conceiued by King Edward the fourth) were attainted by Act of Parliament, anno primo Edward 4, and put to Execution vpon the Tower hill, the 26 of February, 1461. William Lord Berkeley of Berkeley Castle; his wife honoured with the t t es of Viscount, and Marquesse Berkely, Earle of Nottingham, and Earle Mar∣shall of England, was here inhumed; who died, Ann. 1492. This William (as I had it from my deceased friend, Mss. Aug. Vincent ) by his deed dated the third of Nouember, Ann. 6.

Betweene which Al∣tars the body of his wife Ioan (who liued but a few dayes with him, and is not at all mentioned in the Catalogues of Honour) was buried, who was the widow of Sir William Willoughbie, before the marriage with the Mar∣quesse. And to pray for the prosperous estate of the said Marquesse, and of Anne his then wife, and of Edward Willoughby, Richard Willoughby, Anne Beauchampe, and Elisabeth Willoughbie, with all the issue of the said William and Ioane ; and especially for the soules health of the said Ioane, and of Katherine her mother, Duchesse of Norfolke. Here sometime lay sumptuously entombed, Duke . the body of Edward Staf¦ford, Duke of Buckingham; who by the sleights and practises of Cardinall Wolsey, fell into displeasure with king Henry the eight; and being condem∣ned of high Treason, for that (among other matters) hee had consulted with a Monke (or wizard) about succession of the Crowne, was beheaded on the Tower hill, May the 17. 1521. He was a noble Gentleman, excee∣dingly much lamented of good men. Of whose death, when the Emperour Charles the fifth heard, he said that a Butchers dogge (meaning the Car∣dinall, a Butchers sonne) had deuoured the fairest Buck (alluding to the name of Buckingham) in all England. Here was interred the bodie of Edward, Edward the eldest sonne of Edward the black Prince the eldest sonne of Edward the blacke Prince, by Ioan his wife, surnamed the faire Maide of Kent; who was borne at Angolesme, Ann. 1375. and died at 7. yeares of age. Many of the Barons slaine at Barnet-field, vpon Easterday, 1471. were buried here in the bodie of the Church; but now their bodies, with these before remembred, and the bodies of an hundred more (mentioned by Stow ) of exemplarie note and knights degree, are not onely despoiled of all outward funerall ornaments, but digged vp out of their Requietories, and dwelling houses raised in the place, which was appointed for their eternall rest. Some part of this Church is at this day yet standing, but in that no monument of this kinde is remaining; for it is conuerted into a Church for the Duch-Inhabitants of this Citie: who, in that kinde, can hardly brooke any reuerend Antiquitie.

Neare to this gate (if wee giue credit to our owne ancient Chronicles) Nennius the sonne of Hely, Nennius Helius Duke of Loe∣gria. and brother of Lud and Cassibelane, kings ouer the warlike Britaines, was interred. A man of a magnanimous spirit, heroi∣call, and valiant.

But the fifteenth day after this single opposition, hee died of a wound receiued at the hands of Cesar in the same conflict: the yeare of the worlds creation, 3913. before the birth of our alone Sauiour, 51. And here (as I haue said) was entombed with all funerall state and solemnitie: and with him the sword which he tooke from Cesar the Emperour, as he him∣selfe commanded.

For which he is also holden to bee a Founder. This religious house was dedicated to the honour of Saint Helen, and replenished with blacke Nunnes. There was a partition betwixt the Nunnes Church, and the Pa∣rish-Church, but now the whole Church belongeth to the Parish.

This Crosby was Sheriffe of London, the yeare 1470. He was the buil∣der of Crosby house. He gaue fiue hundred Markes towards the reforming of this Church, which was bestowed (saith Stow ) with the better. As ap∣peareth by his Armes both in the stone-worke, roofe of timber, and gla∣sing; it is a fable said of him, to be named Crosby, of being found by a Crosse.

Vnder this defaced Monument, Sir Iohn Erlington knight, with Marga∣ret his wife, daughter and heire to Thomas Lord Itchingham, widow to William Blount, sonne and heire to Walter Blount, the first Lord Mount∣ioy, lye entombed. In this Church diuers honourable persons lie buried, of whom (because they dyed but in these later dayes) I shall speake hereafter. The plates with the Inscriptions of such Monuments as were of more Antiquitie, were all taken away for couetousnesse of the brasse, by one Doctor Hanmer (as I haue it by relation of the Inhabitants) Vicar of this Church, which he con∣uerted into coine, and presently after (ashamed belike of such a detestable act) went ouer into Ireland, and there ignominiously ended his dayes. The Priory of Holywell. This was an house of blacke Nunnes, The founda∣tion of Holy∣well. anciently founded by a Bishop of London, and consecrated to the honour of God, S. Iohn Baptist. Stephen Grauesend, Bishop of this Diocesse, about the yeare 1318. was hereunto a great benefactour. Sir Thomas Louell knight of the Garter, in the raignes of King Henry the seuenth, and of Henry the eighth, with whom hee was of Councell, was another benefactor, not onely in building a beautifull Chap∣pell, wherein his body was interred, but in many other goodly buildings, and endowing the same with lands. In most of the glasse windowes of this house, these two verses following (not long since to be read) were curiously painted: Sir Thomas Louel Knight. Al the Nunnes in Holywel, Pray for the soul of Sir Thomas Louel. He died the 25. of May at Endfield, Ann. 1524. This Priory was valued at the suppression, to haue of Lands two hun∣dred ninetie three pounds ten shillings three pence by yeare, which with the house were surrendred, Ann. 1539. the one and thirtieth of Henry the eight. In ib. Cott. I finde in a pedegree of the right noble Lord Francis, now Earle of Rut∣land, that Sir George Mannors knight, Lord Ros of Hamlake, being with King Henry the eight, at the siege of Turney and Turwine, there tooke a grieuous sicknesse, whereupon he languished, in the same yeare of this their expedition into France; which was Ann. Dom. 1513. And according to his will was here entombed in the Chappell, and neare to the high Altar of this Priory. This Sir George Mannors was the eldest sonne of Sir Robert Mannors knight, by Eleanor his wife, the daughter and heire of Thomas Lord Ros of Hamlake: hee married Anne (the daughter and heire of Sir Thomas, Saint Leoger, or Sellinger knight, begotten of his wife Anne, Duchesse of Exce∣ter, sister to king Edward the fourth) by whom he had issue, Thomas Man∣nors knight of the Garter, Lord Ros of Hamelake, Belvoir, and Trusbut, and Earle of Rutland, the first of that Surname. As also Oliuer, Anthony, Ri∣chard, Iohn, Elisabeth, Katherine, Eleanor, Cicely, or Sisley, and Anne. This house, with a circuite of ground thereunto adioyning, tooke deno∣mination of a certaine sweet, wholesome and cleare fountaine, or well, with∣in the compasse thereof; which for the vertue of the water was amongst the common people reputed and called holy. It is now decayed, and indeed quite spoiled with soile, dung, and other filthinesse, purposely there laid, for the heighthening of the ground for garden plots. The Priory of Clerkenwell. This Priory was likewise so called of a Well not farre from the West end of the Church of the said Priory. Which Well tooke name of the Parish Clarkes in London, who of old time (saith Stow in his Suruay of the said Citie) were accustomed there yearely to assemble, and to play some large history of holy Scripture. This Priory was founded in the yeare of our redemption, one thousand one hundred, or thereabouts, by Iordan Briset, a wealthy and deuout Ba∣ron, the sonne of Rause, the sonne of Brian Briset, who gaue foureteene acres of ground lying in the field neare vnto the said Clarkes well, to build there∣upon an house for religious Votaries, blacke Nunnes. Which donation I haue read depensild vpon a table in the Church, which by the fall of the Steeple (which tooke downe with it a great part of the Church) was bat∣tered all to peeces. The said Iordan with Muriell his wife (for shee is set downe to be co-foundresse with him) dedicated this their sacred structure to the honour of God, and the Assumption of the blessed Virgine Mary. Richard Beauveyes Bishop of London, about the yeare 1112. gaue cer¦taine Lands at Muswell hill to the said Nunnery, now in the possession of Sir Nicholas Roe knight, Lib in lib. C ll confirmed by the Cartulary of king Stephen ; as it is in the Lieger booke of the said house. Sciatis me confirmasse, &c. locum suum, &c. et quicquid Ricardus Episcopus London et Iordanus fil us Bricij, et alij Barones mei rationabiliter in Elemosinam dederunt. Henry the second, he confirmes the scite of the house and land thereunto adioyning, thus. Sci∣atis me concessisse, &c. Ecclesie beate Marie de fonte Clericorum, et Moniali∣bus ibidem deo seruientibus omnia subscripta, &c. scilicet ex dono Iordanis de Briseta et Murielis vxoris eius locum in quo habitant, infra ambitum muri earum, et terram quam extra habent circa muros earum in eodem cam∣po, &c. The names of the Prioresses of this house from the foundation vnto the dissolution, as they are set downe in the same booke, were these. First Chri∣stiana. 2. Ermegard. 3. Hawisia. 4. Eleonora. 5. Alesia. 6. Cecilia. 7. Mar∣gerie Whatvile. 8. Isabell. 9. Alice Oxeney. 10. Amice Marcy. 11 Denys Bras. 12. Margery Bray. 13. Ioan Lewkenor. 14. Ioan Fulham. 15. Kathe∣rine Braybroke. 16. Luce Attewood. 17. Ioan Viene. 18. Margaret Bakwell. 19. Isabell Wentworth. 20. Margaret Bull. 21. Agnes Clifford. 22. Kathe∣rine Greene. 23. Isabell Hussey. And the last Lady Prioresse of this house was Isabell Sackvile, of the right honourable Familie of the Sackviles, the Ancestors of Sir Edward Sackvile, now Baron of Buckhurst, and Earle of Dorset. She lieth buried vnder a marble stone in the Church of the Nun∣nery neare vnto the high Altar, whereupon this Inscription, or Epitaph, is engrauen in brasse. Hic iacet Isabella Sackvile, Isabell Sackvile Prioresse of S. Maries Clerken∣well. quae fuit Priorissa nuper Prioratus de Clerk∣enwel, tempore dissolutionis eiusdem Prioratus, quae fuit 21. Octobris, Ann. Dom. Millesimo quingentesimo septuagesimo: et Ann. Reg. Regin. Elisab. Dei gra. &c. duodecimo. She made her last Will and Testament (as I finde it in the Prerogatiue office) the nineteenth day of February, in the said twelfth yeare of Queene Elizabeth, wherein she bequeathes her body to be buried in Clarkenwell Church, and ordaines the right honourable the Lord of Buckhurst her Cosin, the ouerseer of this her Will, if it shall please his Lordship to take the paines: She liued many yeares in the various dayes of diuers Princes: for I finde in the pedegree of the Earle of Dorset, that one William Sackevyle, by his Will and Testament, dated the tenth day of August, in the 21. yeare of King Henry the seuenth, gaue to his Neece Isabell Sackvyle a certaine Le∣gacie, she being as then a Nunne in the Priory of Clerkenwell. Iordan Briset the foresaid Founder, Iordan Briset & Muriell his wife. died the 17. of September, about the yeare of our Lord, 1124. and Muriell his wife, the first of May next fol∣lowing: they were buried both together in the Chapter-house of this Church, now called the old Vestrie. In the the Chancell is a faire marble Tombe, with the of a dead man lying vpon his shroud: . the most artificially cut n stone that euer man beheld; all the plates of brasse are stolne away, onely some few peeces remaining, containing these words. ..... Hospitalitate inclytus, genere preclarus...... Hanc Vrnam offcij causa....... Ecce quem cernis tuo nomini semper deuotum Suscipe in sinum Virgo Maria tuum. Spes me non fallat quam in te semper habebam Virgo da facilem.......... This Monument was erected to the memory of Sir William Weston knight, Lord Prior of Saint Iohns Ierusalem, at the time of the dissolution of the said Priory, to whom Henry the eight for his maintenance had allow∣ed one thousand pound of yearely pension during his life. Of which summe he receiued neuer a penny: for so it fortuned, that vpon the seuenth day of May, 1540. being Ascention day, and the same day of the dissolution of the house, he was dissolued by death, which strooke him to the heart, at the first time when he heard of the dissolution of his order. All the Funerall Monuments of Antiquitie in this Church (which were many) as you may reade in Stowes Suruay, are quite defaced. This Priory was valued at the suppression to be possest of 282. l. 16. s. 5. d. of yearely reuenues. Within the close of this Nunnery is a faire spatious house, built of late by Sir Thomas Challoner knight deceased: vpon the Frontispice whereof these verses were depensild, now altogether obliterated. Casta fides superest, velatae tecta sorores Ista relegatae desuruere licet: Nam venerandus Hymen hic vota ingalia seruat Vestalemque focum mente fouere studet. The Nunnery (now the inheritance of the right honourable Sir William Cauendish knight, Lord Ogle, Viscount Mansfield, and Earle of Newcastle) being opposite to this new braue building, ministred (belike) occasion and matter for the making of this said Inscription. This Hexamiter following is painted vnder a Sunne diall in the entrance vnto the Nunnery. Non aliter pereo species quam futilis Vmbrae. The Priory of S. Iohn of Ierusalem. Iordan Briset hauing first founded the Priory of Nunnes here by Clerk∣enwell, as aforesaid, bought of the said Nunnes ten Acres of ground, giuing them for the said ten Acres, twenty Acres of land in his Lordship of Wil∣linghale, or Wellinghall in Kent. Vpon which ground (lying neare vnto the said Priory) hee laid the foundation of a religious structure for the knights Hospitalers of S. Iohn of Ierusalem. These following are the words out of the Register booke of the Deedes of the said house, written by one Iohn Stilling-fleete, a brother of the house, circa ann. 1434. to the end that their benefactors names being knowne, Mss. in bib. Cot. they may be daily remembred in their prayers. Iordanus Briset Baro tempore regis Hen. primi circa an. Dom. 110. fun∣dauit domum ac Hospitale S. Iohns de Clerkenwel: Hic etiam erat Funda∣tor domus Monialium de Clerkenwel, ac ab eis emit decem acras terre, super quas dictum Hospitale ac domum fundauit: & pro illis decem acris terre, de∣dit illis Monialibus viginti acras terre in Dominico suo de Willinghale in com. Cant. &c. In ye yere of Criste (as I haue the words out of an old Mss) 1185. ye vj. Ides of Merche, In bib Cott. ye dominical lettre being F, ye Chyrche of ye Hospitall of S: Iohns Ierusalem, was dedicatyd to ye honor of S. Iohn Baptiste by ye worschypfull fader Araclius Patriarke, of ye resurrection of Christe, ye sam dey was dedycatyd ye hygh Altr , and ye Altre of S. Iohn Euangelist by ye sam Patryarke. The said Heraclius in the same yeare, dedicated the Church of the new Temple, as hereafter is spoken. Within a short time, this Hospitall began to flourish, for infinite were the donations of all sorts of people to this Fraternitie, as in the Beadroul of their benefactors is specified; but aboue all their Benefactors, they held themselues most bound to Roger de Mowbray, whose liberalitie to their order was so great, that by a common consent in their chapiter, they made a decree, that himselfe might remit and pardon any of the Brotherhood whomsoeuer, in case he had trespassed against any of the statutes and ordi∣nances of their order, confessing and acknowledging withall, his offence and errour. And also the knights of this order granted, in token of thanke∣fulnesse to Iohn de Mowbray, Lord of the Isle of Axholme, the successour of the foresaid Roger, that himselfe and his successours, in euery of their couents & assemblies, as well in England, as beyond seas, should be receiued & entertained alwaies in the second place next to the King. Thus through the bounty both of Princes & priuate persons, they rose to so high an estate, and great riches, that after a sort (saith Camden ) they wallowed in wealth; Camd. in A dl. for they had about the yeere of our Lord 1240. within christendome, nine¦teene thousand Lordships or Manours: like as the Templars nine thou∣sand (the reuenewes and rents whereof fell afterwards also to these Hospi∣tallers.) And this estate of theirs growne to so great an height, made way for them to as great honours; so as the Priore of this house was reputed the prime Baron of the land, being able with fulnesse & abundance of all things to maintaine an honourable port.

And thus they flourished for many yeeres in Lordly pompe, vntill a Parliament begun the 18. of April, 1540. Anno 32. Henry 8. their corporation was vtterly dissolued, the King al∣lowing to euery one of them, onely a certaine annuall pension during their liues; as you may reade in the Annals of England. The value of this foundation in the Kings bookes, was 3385 l. 19 s. 8 d. of ancient yeerely rent. This Priory Church and house was preserued from spoile, or downe pulling, so long as Henry the 8 raigned, but in the 3 of King Ed. the sixt, the Church for the most part, with the great Bell-tower (a most curious piece of workemanship, grauen, gilt and enameld, to the great beautifying of the Citie, saith Stow ) was vndermined and blowne vp with Gun-powder; the stone whereof was imployed in building of the Lord Protectors house in in the Strand. The Charter-house. The foundati¦on of he Charterhouse. Sir Walter Manny Knight of the Garter, Lord of the towne of Manny in the Dioces of Cambrey, beyond the seas; in that raging pestilence in the 23 of King Ed. the 3. when Churches & Church-yards in London might not suffice to bury the dead, purchased a piece of ground in this place cal∣led Spitle croft, containing 13 acres and a Rodd, and caused the same to bee enclosed for burials, and dedicated by Raph Stratford Bishop of London; in which place, and in the same yeere, more then 50000 persons were bu∣ried, in regard of such a multitude here interred: he caused a Chappell here to be builded, wherein Offerings were made, and Masses said for the soules of so many Christians departed. And afterwards about the yeere 1371. he caused here to be founded, an house of Carthusian Monkes, which he cal∣led the Salutation: which house at the dissolution, was valued to be yeerely worth, sixe hundred forty two pounds, foure pence halfe penny. Stow Suruay. Iohn Stow saith, that he had read this Inscription following, fixed on a stone crosse, sometime standing in the Charter-house Church yard. Anno Domini M.ccc.xl.ix. Regnante magna pestilentia, consecratum fuit hoc Cemiterium, in quo & infra septa presentis Monasterij, sepulta fue∣runt mortuorum Corpora, plusquam quinquaginta millia, preter alia multa abhinc vsque ad presens, quorum animabus propitietur Deus. Amen. Ex Mss. in bib. Cot. This inscription vpon the foresaid Stone Crosse, as also the relation be∣fore, was taken out from the words of his charter, the substance whereof followeth. Walterus Dns. de Many, &c. cum nuper pestilentia esset tam grandis & vi∣ lenta in ciuitate London quod Cemiteria Ecclesiae ciuitatis non possunt suf∣ficere pro sepultura a personarum in eadem pestilentia discedentia, nos moti pi∣etate habentes respectum, &c. Purchased 13. acres of land without Smith∣field Barres, in a place called Spitle croft, and now called new Church-Haw, for the buriall of the persons aforesaid, and haue caused the place to be blessed by Raph then Bishop of London: in which place, plus quam Quinquaginta millia personarum de dicta pestilentia morientium sepulti fuere.

Sir Walter Manny, or de Manie, the foresaid Founder, was buried here in his owne Church, who deceased in the same yeere that he laid his foun∣dation, 137 . His death was much lamented, by the King, the Nobilitie, and commons of all England; for, with singular commendations, hee had for a long time serued vnder Edward the third in the French warres, and was employed by him vpon seuerall Embasies, and his truth and good councell was euer much auailable to the whole state of the kingdome. His obsequies were performed with great solemnity; King Edward the third, and all his children, with the greatest Prelates, and Lord Barons of the king∣dome, being there present. Margaret, La∣dy Many, and Du chesse of Norfolke. His wife Margaret, was here entombed with him; by whom he had issue, Thomas Manye, who in his youth was drow∣ned in a Well at Detford in Kent, and Anne, then his onely daughter, and heire, married to Iohn, Lord Hastings, Earle of Penbroke: Margaret, Suruay. Lady Manye, saith Iohn Stow, here interred, (yet the Cata∣logue of Honour will haue her to be buried in the Minories) died the 24. of March, 1399. she was the onely daughter of Thomas of Brotherton, Earle of Norfolke, and Marshall of England, second sonne of King Edward the first, and her fathers onely heire after the death of her brother Edward, which happened in the same yeare that his father departed the world. She was for the greatnesse of her birth, her large reuenewes and wealth, created Dutchesse of Norfolke for terme of life: she had beene first married to Iohn Lord Segraue, Vin e t C t l. Norf. and her last husband was the foresaid Sir Walter Manny. Here sometime was interred the body of Philip Morgan, Doctor of Law, Philip Morgan Bishop of Ely. Chancelour of Normandy, and Bishop of Ely; a very wise man, who with great commendations gouerned that See nine yeeres sixe mo¦neths, and foure daies, and departed this life at Bishops-Hatfield, Octo∣ber 25. 1434. Many funerall monuments were in this Church, Suttons Hospi∣tall. as you may finde them mentioned in the Suruay of London. This religious house is now turned into an Hospitall, consisting of a Ma∣ster, a Preacher, a Free-Schoole with a Master and an Vsher, fourescore de∣caied gentlemen Souldiers, and forty schollers, maintained with sufficient cloathing, meate, drinke, lodging, and wages; besides Officers and Mini∣sters to attend vpon them all; so that the whole number now in the house with the attendants, is one hundred and fourescore. The greatest gift that euer at any time in England, no Abbey (at the first foundation thereof) ex∣cepted, or therewith to bee compared, being the gift of one man onely, whose name was Thomas Sutton of Castle Campes, in the County of Cam∣bridge Esquire, borne at Knaith in the County of Lincolne, who liued to the age of 79 yeares, and deceased the 12. day of December, 1611. somewhat before this his famous Foundation was fully accomplished. Great Saint Bartholomewes. This Priorie was founded by one Rahere, The foundati∣on of great Saint Bartho∣lomewes. a pleasant conceited wittie gen∣tleman, and a Courtier in the raigne of King Henry the first, which he de∣dicated to the honour of God and Saint Bartholomew, and placed therein blacke Canons, or Canons regular; himselfe became their first Prior; his foundation was confirmed in these words.

Here he died, and was here buried in a faire monument, renewed by Pri∣or Bolton, illiam Bolton the last Prior of S Bartholo∣mewes. which Bolton was the last Prior of this house; a great builder and repairer of the Priorie, and the Parish Church, and of diuers lodgings be∣longing to the same: as also of new he builded the Mannor of Canonbury (now called Canbury) at Islington, which belonged to the Canons of this house. This Bolton and the rest of his brethren were portraied vpon a Ta∣ble sometimes hanging in this Church, now it is in Sir Robert Cottons Li∣brarie, holding vp their hands to the Crucifixe, vnder whom, these verses were depensi d. Gulielmo Bolton precibus succurrite vestris Qualis erat pater hic, Domus hec, & cetera monstrant. He died at his Parsonage house at Harrow vpon the hill (as I haue it by relation) the fourth of Edward the sixt, and was there interred. He surrendred vp this his Priorie the 30 of Henry the 8. which was then valued at 757 l. 8 s. 4 d. ob q. by yeere. Roger Walden Bishop of Lon∣don. Here sometime lay entombed the body of Roger Walden, Bishop of London. Neuer had any man better experience of the variable vncertaintie of worldly felicity, then he; for from the estate of a very poore man, he was suddenly raised to be Treasurer of England (hauing beene first Secretarie to the King, Godwin de prae∣sulibus Angl. Deane of Yorke, and Treasurer of the towne of Calis) and then made Archbishop of Canterbury; which honour he enioyed not past two yeares, but was remoued from the same, and forced to leade a priuate life a long time. At last being once more lift vp to the honour of this Bi∣shopricke of London; he left this present life within the compasse of the yeere following. Of this man thus writeth Thomas Walsingham, who liued in those times, and much what to the same effect. I will vse his owne lan∣guage. Vpodigma Neustricae. Anno 1406.

It was valued at the suppression to 305. l. 6. s. 7. d. yearely. The Church remaineth a Parish to the Tenants dwelling in the precinct of the Hospitall; in which are many faire Funerall Monuments.

The White Friers. The founda∣tion of the white Friers Carmelites. These Friers were called Fratres beatae Mariae de monte Carmeli: first founded by Sir Richard Grey knight, ancestor to the Lord Grey of Codnor, in the yeare 1241. King Edward the first gaue to the Prior and brethren of that house, a plot of ground here in Fleetstreet, whereupon to build their house: which was afterwards new builded by Hugh Courtney (the third of that Christian name Earle of Deuonshire) the yeare before he died, which was Aun. 1350. Sir Robert Knolles knight, was a great builder here also, in the raigne of Richard the second, Stow S uay. and of Henry the fourth: who (being borne but of meane parentage in the County of Chester) was by his valiant behauiour aduanced from a common Souldier (in the French warres vnder Edward the third) to a great Commander; and being sent Generall of an Armie into France, in despite of their power, he draue their people before him like Sheepe, Lamb peramb. destroying Townes, Castles, and Cities, in such a manner and number, that long after in memory of this act, the sharpe points and gable ends of ouerthrowne houses and Minsters, were called Knolles Mi∣ters. After which minding to make himselfe as welbeloued of his countrey, as he was feared of forraine nations, hee built the goodly faire Bridge at Rochester, Lamb. peramb. ouer the Riuer of Medway, with a Chappell and a Chantrie at the East end thereof. He founded a Colledge, with an Hospitall adioyning thereunto; in the Towne of Pontefract in Yorkeshire, of which hereafter. He founded also an Hospitall in the Citie of Rome, for entertainment of English trauellers, or pilgrimes, to that Citie, in place where Thomas Bec∣ket, Archbishop of Canterbury, had builded a Chappell of the holy Tri∣nity, which to this day retaines the name, and is a Seminarie for our Eng¦lish Fugitiues. He deceased at his Mannor of Scone Thorpe in Norfolke, was brought to London, and honourably buried by the Lady Constance his wife, in the body of this Church; which he had newly builded. Ann. 1407. the 15. of August. Of whom in his life, saith Stow, were made verses in Latine, thus by him put into English. O Robert Knowles, most worthy of Fame, By thy Prowesse France was made tame. Thy manhood made the French to yeeld, By dint of sword in towne and feeld. Here sometime lay entombed in a goodly Monument of Alabaster, the body of Robert Mascall, Rob Mascall Bishop of He¦reford. Bishop of Hereford, a man for his good learning and good life admired, and beloued of all men: He was often employed by Henry the fourth (to whom he was Confessor) vpon Embasies to forraine Princes; and in the yeare 1415. sent with two other Bishops to the Coun∣cell of Constance. Hee built the Quier, Presbytery, and Steeple of this Church; and gaue many rich ornaments to this religious house, wherein he died, 22. Decemb. 1416. William Lord Montacute Earle of Salisbury, Will. Montag Earle of Salis¦bury. Ypod g and king of the Isle of Man, was here entombed. Whose noble Acts (saith Walsingham ) to write wor∣thily were a commendable matter. He founded the Abbey of Bisham Mon∣tague in Barkshire, and died at a Iusts and Turney at Windsore, in the yeare 1343. For the rest here interred, I referre my Reader to the Suruay of London. This house was valued at 26. l. 7. s. 3. d. and was surrendred the tenth of Nouember, the 30. of king Hen. the eight. Since the writing of the premisses, Penes T swell. I chanced to haue the perusall of a Manuscript, penned in the praise of this religious Order; out of which I collected diuers Epitaphs, which in times past had beene engrauen vpon the Sepulchers of certaine Carmelites, here in the Church of this Priory in∣terred. And first, Stephen Pa∣trington Bishop of S. Dauids. I finde that Stephen Patrington, vir omnibus praestantio∣ribus animi dotibus, omnibus virtutibus preditus, et multiplici doctrinae va∣rietate instructus, was here buried in the body of the Quire. He was borne in the County of Yorke, and brought vp in the Vniuersitie of Oxford, where he proceeded Doctor of Diuinitie. He writ many learned bookes, and was an admirable Preacher, to whose Sermons alwayes came an incre∣dible concurse of people, saith Leland. Hee was for the space of fifteene yeares Prouinciall of the Carmelites: Confessor he was to king Henry the fourth, and held of him in great estimation, as also to his Queene, and his eldest sonne Henry Prince of Wales; who when he came to the Crowne, preferred him to the Bishopricke of Saint Dauids in Wales. Being at the Councell of Constance, he was, by the Pope, translated to Chichester; not long after which he departed this world: and as it is in the Records in the Tower before his translation could be perfected: in the yeare 1417. the 22. of September. But I will come to the Inscription vpon his Tombe, in verse and prose as followeth. Hic Frater Stephanus de Patrington requiescit, Nomine reque fuit norma, corona, Pater.

Here somtime lay buried the bodie of Nicholas Kenton ; borne in Kenton a village in Suffolke, about ten miles from Ipsewich; he was matriculated and instructed in the rudiments of learning amongst the Carmelites at Ipswich. From whence he went to Cambridge, where he attained to the full perfe∣ction of all solide discipline. In poesie and Rhetoricke hee was exquisitely well exercised, an acute Philosopher he was, and a singular diuine. He writ many learned Comments vpon sundrie places of the Scripture; and many other workes mentioned by Bale ; He was Prouinciall of his order in Eng∣land for the space of twelue yeares; and had vnder his gouernment aboue a thousand and fiue hundred Carmelites. Hee desired, not long before his death, to giue ouer his Prouinciallship, saying, Se iam malle precibus et Deo liberè vacare, quam praxi attendere, parere potius deinceps velle quam pre∣esse. Which was granted after much earnest suite made to all his Couents. He died in the Dormitorie of this house, the fourth day of September, in the yeare of our Lord, 1468. to whose honour this riming Epitaph was an∣nexed to his funerall Monument. Kenton Doctoris Carmilite Nicholai, Sic Peccatricis anime miserens Adonai. Carmeli gentis curam qui rexit in Anglis Ipsa bis senis fungens summus Prior annis. Huic sibi propitius veniam prestet pater almus; Cuius spiramen scandens supra astra sit. Amen. Io. Miluerton. Iohn Miluerton, a Carmelite Frier of Bristow, was here entombed; hee was Doctor of Diuinitie, and of the Chaire, in the Vniuersitie of Oxford; from whence he was sent for to Paris, by Iohn Sorethe the Prouinciall of his Order, where by a generall Synode he was chosen Prouinciall of his order, through England, Scotland, and Ireland. At length (because he defended such of his order as preached against endowments of the Church with tem∣porall possessions) hee was brought into trouble, committed to prison in Castle S. Angelo in Rome, where he continued three yeares, and at length was deliuered through certaine of the Cardinals, that were appointed his iudges; but in the meane time he lost the Bishopricke of Saint Dauids, to which he was elected. He writ diuers learned workes before, after, and du∣ring the time of his imprisonment, which are mentioned by Bale in his fift centurie. At the last, full of yeeres and cares, he here ended his life, the last day saue one of Ianuary in the yeare of our redemption, 1486. and was bu∣ried in the Quire of this monasterie, with these nicking Hexameters engra∣uen vpon his monument. Clauditur hic subtus prudens veri reserator, Carmeli cultor, Doctrine firmus amator. Rite Iohannes Oxoniensis in ordine Doctor Sic orthodoxe sidei validus releuator. Post Prouinquecialis vixit pluribus annis, Mirifice crebro vexatus tempore dampnis Huic reus est sceleris annus magni tribulantis, Gaudeat ob meritum constans robur patientis, Ipsum turbauit vir fortis perniciose, Tandem Catholice trusus superat speciose. Aureolam Deus vt det Myluerton numerose, Optemus, fuerat plexus licet inuidiose. Iohn Loneye Doctor of Diuinity, Iohn Loney. and a Carmelite Frier, was here inter∣red in the cloister of the Church, to whose memory this distich was made. Clauditur hoc claustro Frater Loneye Iohannes Expertus mundo celo fruiturus vt heres. This Loney, Pits. de illust. Aug. Scriptori∣bus. saith a late writer, was vir acu i ingenij, magnae doctrinae, multae lectionis, boni zeli, multae industriae : A man of an acute wit, excel∣lent doctrine, much reading, ardent deuotion, great industrie. Hee with twelue other Doctors did condiscend to the decree (saith my Mss ) of Ma∣ster William Barton, Chancellour of the vniuersitie of Oxford, for the con∣demning of the sixteene Articles of Iohn Wickliffe of the Sacrament of the Altar. An Epitaph vpon Iohn Palgraue, Prior sometimes of this house. Huius confratris grauis est instantia, causa Qua domus hec superest proceraque fabrica libris, Et murus validus excludit Tamesis vndas. Vestes dat sacras sibi det vestes Deus albas. Of this Prior I finde no further; neither of any other of the Carmelites buried within this conuentuall Church. Black Friers Church in Oldborne: In old time about the yeere 1221. there was a religious house of Friers Predicants, without the Bars in Oldborne; to which order, Hubert de Bur∣go Earle of Kent, was an especiall Benefactor: giuing vnto them that noble Pallace at Westminster, now called White Hall: Thus Hubert was a faith∣full seruant to King Iohn, and to his sonne Henry the third, a carefull Patriot of the State, and one who vnfainedly loued his Country, who when he had made triall of the variable changes of Fortune, Hubert de Bur∣go Earle of Kent. as being seldome, or neuer, but either highly in the Kings loue, or in the Subiects hatred, or in the Kings heauy displeasure, and the peoples generall applause; lastly, being full fraught with yeers, as he was with many eminent vertues, he died, in the fa∣uour of God, the King, and all good men, at his Mannor of Bansted in Sur∣rey, the Ides of May, Anno 1243. Hee was first here intombed, but after∣wards (as though he had beene fatally ordained to take no more rest in his graue, then quietnesse in his world y employments) his body was transla∣ted, at the same time when these Friers were remoued from Oldborne into London, to that house now called the blacke Friers, neere vnto Ludgate: where belike it takes no better rest, then others haue done so buried.

Clericus paruae Bagiae or Clarke of the Petit Bagge, is an Officer in the Chancerie, Cowell lit. c. of which sort there be three, and the Master of the Rolles is their chiefe. Their Office is to record the returne of all Inquisitions, out of euery Shire, all Liueries granted in the Court of Wards, all ouster les maines, to make all Patents of Customers, Gawgers, Controllers and Aulnegers; all Conge d'eslires for Bishops, all Liberateis vpon extent of Statute Staples; the recouery of Recognisances forfeited, and all Elegits vpon them; the sum∣mons of the Nobilitie, Clergie, and Burgesses of the Parliament, Commis∣sions directed to Knights, and other of euery shire, for seassing of the Sub∣sidies, Writs for the nomination of Collectors, and all trauerses vpon any Office, bill, or otherwise, and to receiue money duel to the King for the same. This Officer is mentioned, Anno 33. Hen. 8. cap. 22. and it is like hee had first this denomination and stile of Petie Bagges, because hauing to doe with so many Records of diuers kindes, as aboue mentioned, they were put in sundry leather Bagges, which were not so great as the Clarke of the Ham∣per now vseth, and therefore might be called Petits Bagges, small or little bagges. This Iohn Gyles was also keeper or Clerke of the Rolles and Records in the Tower of London; an Office generally well knowne throughout all England; the master whereof at this day is that learned Gentleman, Sir Iohn Borrowes Knight; vnder whom my vnderstanding friend Will. Collet, and my industrious country-man, Will. Riley, alias Rouge-Rose, Pursiuant at Armes, doe officiate the place. Lawrence Bar∣telet.

The first Founder hereof is not certainely recorded, The first San∣ctuary. some hold that it was built by Dunwallo Mulmutius, about the yeare of the worlds creation, 4748 the precincts whereof, he made a Sanctuary, or a place of refuge for any person therein to be assured of life, liberty, and limbs, of which I haue spoken elsewhere. Besides these priuiledges vnto Temples, hee constituted diuers good lawes. Of which he writ two bookes, the one called Statuta municipalia, the other Leges iudiciariae, which is as much to say, as the statute Law, and the common Law.

Hee raigned 40. yeares, died the yeare of the worlds creation, 4768. and was buried in this place, with other of the British Kings. But it appeareth by this inscription following ouer the Church doore in the stone worke, that this holy Stru¦cture was newly founded of farre later times, and dedicated to the honour of the blessed Virgine: yet I thinke it is farre more ancient. Anno ab incarnatione Domini M.C.lxxxv. dedicata hec Eccle∣sia in honorem beate Marie, The Founda∣tion of the Temple Church. a Domino Eraclio dei gratia Sancte Resurrectionis Ecclesie Patriarcha, 11 Idus Februarij. Qui eam annatim petentibus de iniuncta sibi Penitentia lx. dies indulsit. Knights Templers were the last Founders of this house, which at the first were certaine noble Souldiers religiously bent, who bound themselues by vow in the hands of the Patriarke of Ierusalem to serue Christ after the manner of Regular canons, in chastitie and obedience, and to defend Chri∣stian Religion, the holy land, and Pilgrimes going to visite the Lords Se∣pulchre, they flourished for a time in high reputation, for pietie and deuo∣tion, but as they increased in wealth, so they fell to wickednesse; insomuch that in the yeere 1308. all the Templers in England, as also in other parts of Christendome, were apprehended and committed to diuers Prisons, and in the yeare 1312. all their lands were giuen to the Knights Hospitalers of the order of Saint Iohn Baptist, called Saint Iohn of Ierusalem, as I haue said elsewhere. There are in this Temple many very ancient monuments of famous men, (for out of what respect I know not King Henry the third, and many of the Nobility, desired much to be buried in this Church) shaped in marble, ar∣med, their legges crosse, whose names are not to be gathered, by any in∣scriptions, for that time hath worne them out; vpon the vpper part of one of their portraitures, Camden saith that hee hath read. Comes Penbrochie, and vpon the side this verse. Miles eram Martis Mars multos vicerat armis. Cant. in Mid∣lesex London. Of Mars I was a doughty knight, Mars vanquisht many a man in fight.

Vnder which monument lieth William Marshall the elder, Earle of Pen∣broke, a most powerfull man in his time, being the Kings Marshall, Gene∣rall of his Armie, and Protector of the kingdome in the minority of King Henry the third, vntill such time as he the said William died, which was in the yeare 1219. 27 die Martij. This Epitaph following goes also currant for this glorious and triumphant Earle, as an Epitome of his noble vertues. Sum quem Saturnum sibi sensit Hibernia, Solem Anglia, Mercurium Normannia, Gallia Martem. Irelands Saturne, Englands Sunne am I, The Mars of France, and Normans Mercury: or thus. Whom Ireland once a Saturne found, England a Sunne to be, Whom Normandy a Mercury, and France Mars, I am he. This William had fiue sonnes, William, Richard, Gilbert, Walter, and Anselme, all Earles of Penbroke, and Marshals of England. William Mar¦shall. the yon∣ger, Earle of Penbroke. Here by his father vnder the like monument, lieth William the eldest sonne, Earle of Penbroke, Lord of Strighull, Chepstow, Caerwent, Leigh (or Liege) Weshford, Kildare, Ossorie and Carlogh, who died the sixt of Aprill, 1231. as it is in the booke of Wauerly, wherein this Epitaph is made to his memory. Militis istius mortem dolet Anglia, ridet Wallia, viuentis bella minasque timens. England laments the death of this braue Knight, Wales laughs, he liuing did her so affright. The Annales of Ireland will haue him to be buried by his brother Ri∣chard, in the Quire of the Friers Predicants in Kilkennie, of whom it was thus written. Cuius sub fossa Kilkennia continet Ossa, Whose bones bestowed in graue so deep, Kilkenny Towne doth safely keep. Wheresoeuer he was buried, a Martiall braue Earle he was, which hee worthily shewed, when as he set vpon Lehwellin Prince of Wales, who inuaded his Territories, in his absence whilst he was prosecuting the warres in Ireland, and returned from that battell a triumphant Conqu rour. Vnder another Monument lieth the body of Gilbert Marshall, G lbe Ma shall Earle of Penbroke. Earle of Penbroke, and Marshall of England: Lord of Longevile in Normandy, Leinster in Ireland, and of Chepstow, Strighull, and Caerwent in Wales. This Potent Peere of the Realme (saith Mathew Paris, in Ann. 1241.) proclaimed a Turnament (in scorne of the kings authoritie; whereby such disports were forbidden) to be holden at Hertford in the County of Hert¦ford; to which place, when many both of the Nobilitie and Gentrie were assembled; it happened that himselfe running, by the flinging of his horse was cast out of his sadle; and the horse gaue him such a blow on the breast, that he died the same day, being the fifth of the Kalends of Iuly, 1241. as aforesaid. Paris 1 4 . His bowels were interred in the Abbey Church in the Towne of Hertford, with the bowels of one Sir Robert de Say knight, a gallant gen∣tleman, slaine in the same exercise. These kinde of Iusts or Turnaments were brought in with king Stephen, and practised in many places of England, in such an outragious manner, and with such slaughter of Gentlemen, Hastiludium. Paris. that to suppresse such an heathenish disport, it was decreed by Parliament, that whosoeuer therein were slaine, should want Christian buriall; and their heires be disinherited. Hic requiescit ..... R... Ep.... Quondam Visitator generalis ordinis Milicie Templi, Sir Rob. Rosse knight. in Anglia & in Francia & in Italia. .... This was a fragment of a funeral Inscription insculped vpon one of these crosse-legged Monuments; as I found it amongst other Collections by one studious in Antiquities, in Sir Robert Cottons voluminous Librarie: which he proues by the pedegree of the said Lord Rosses, to haue beene made to the memory of one Robert Rosse a Templer, who died about the yeare 1245. and gaue to the Templars his Mannor of Ribston.

So called because Harold (surnamed Harefoot, for his swift footman∣ship) king of England, of the Danish line, and other Danes, were here buried. This Harold was the base sonne of king Canut, by his concubine Alice of Woluerhampton in Staffordshire, a Shoomakers daughter. His body was first buried at Westminster, Stow Annal. but afterwards Hardicanut, the lawfull sonne of Canut being king, commanded his body to bee digged out of the earth, and to be throwne into the Thames, where it was by a Fisherman taken vp and buried in this Churchyard. He died at Oxford, 1040. hauing raigned three yeares and eight moneths. Io. Arundel Bi∣shop of Exce∣ter. Hic iacet .... Iohannes Arundell .... Episcopus Exon. qui ob. die mens. Maij 15... 1503.

Of which you may reade this Inscription en∣grauen ouer the Gate, towards the Street. 1505. Hospitium hoc inopi Turbe Sauoia vocatum, Septimus Henricus fundauit ab imo solo.

Saint Mary Rounciuall. The Hospitall of Saint Mary Rounciuall. This was an Hospitall by Charing Crosse, and a cell to the Priorie, and couent of Rounciuall in Nauar, in Pampalone Diocesse, where a Fraterni∣tie was founded in the 15 of Edward the fourth. Hospitall of Saint Iames. Hospitall of Saint Iames. This Hospitall was anciently founded by the Citizens of London, for fourteene Sisters maidens, that were leprous, liuing chastly and honestly. This Hospitall was surrendred to Henry the eight, the 23 of his raigne: the Sisters being compounded withall, were allowed Pensions for the terme of their liues; and the King builded there a goodly mannor house annexing thereunto a Parke. The Foundation of the religious house of Conuerts in Chancerie lane, (anciently called New-streete,) now knowne by the name of the Rolles. Henry the third, about the twentieth yeare of his raigne, built this house for the Iewes, conuerted & to be conuerted to the faith of Christ: these are the words in his grant.

But this Foundation did not continue long, for Edward the first (his sonne) in the eighteenth yeare of his raigne, banished all the Iewes out of England, confiscating all their goods, and leauing them nothing but mo∣ney (barely) to beare their charges. King Edward the third appointed this house for the custody of the Rolles and Records of the Chancerie; des s Ca al.

This was a religious Structure, first begun by King Stephen, The foundati∣on of S. Stephens Chappell. and after∣wards finished, and her reuenewes greatly augmented by King Edward the third; in which he placed a Deane, twelue Canons secular, as many Vicars, and other Ministers, who had their lodgings in Canon Row, now the ha∣bitations of diuers Noblemen and Gentlemen. These are the words of King Edwards Grant. In dei nomine Amen. Charta Regis Ed. tetijs. ex Re∣cord turr s Lon∣don. Edwardus dei gratia, &c. Salutem.

The reuenewes wherewith King Edward endowed this couent, amoun∣ted to the value of fiue hundred pounds by yeare; and at the suppression, the whole foundation was rated to be yeerely worth, (as I haue it in the ca∣talogue of Religious houses,) one thousand, fourescore, and fiue pound ten shillings, fiue pence. This Chappell serueth now for the lower house of Par∣liament. Westminster Abbey. The foundati∣ West∣ inster Ab∣bey. CAmden out of Sulcardus reporteth, that here sometime stood an I∣doll Temple, dedicated to Apollo ; ouerthrowne by an earthquake, about the yeare of grace, 153. Of the ruines of which, Sebert, King of the East Saxons, erected another Temple for the seruice of the liuing God, and consecrated the same to Saint Peter, about the yeare 610. neere about the time of the building of Paules, Mellitus as then being Bishop of London, and Austin of Canterbury, which agrees with these words in the charter of Edward the Confessor. In Arch. turris London. Basilica sancti Petri VVestmon. edificata fuit antiquitus sub Mellito Lon∣donie primo Episcopo socio et contemporaneo Sancti Augustini primi Cantu∣ar.

King Ethelbert, Sainct Poules edefied: Iohn Harding ca. 88. And King Sebert Westminster founded: Mellito theim both halowed and blessified, Austin then, made Clerke full well grounded. Afterwards this Church being destroyed by the Danes; Dunstan Bishop of London, reedified it about the yeare of Christ, 960. and made here a monastery for twelue Monkes. After him Edward the confessor with the tenth penny of all his reuenewes, built it new for to be his owne Sepulture: and a Monastery for Benedictin Monkes, endowing it with liuings and ands, lying disperst in diuers parts of England. But, after an hundred and threescore yeeres, King Henry the third subuerted this Fabricke of King Edwards, and built from the very Foundation, a new Church of very faire workemanship, supported with sundry rowes of Pillars.

The first stone of this admirable Structure, con∣secrated to the honour of the blessed Virgine, was laid by the hands of Iohn Islip Abbot of this monastery, Sir Reginald Bray, Knight of the Garter, and others, in the 18 yeare of his raigne, the 24 day of Ianuary, vpon which stone this Inscription was engrauen. Illustrissimus Henricus Septimus Rex Anglie et Francie, et Dominus Hi∣bernie, posuit hanc Petram in honore beate virginis Marie xxiiij. die Ian a∣arij, anno Domini M.ccccc 11: et anno dicti Regis Henrici septimi decimo octauo. Harpsfeeld, Hist. Ecclesiast. Angl. vnde . ae∣cul. ca. 16. sometime Archdeacon of Canterbury, writing of the Anti∣quitie and famous renowne of this Monastery, hath these words. Vt Albanense, propter protomartyris nostri Albani nobile eo loci mar∣tyrium, sacrasque etiam ibi reconditas reliquias, coenobium reliquorum sem∣per princeps habitum est, ita posterioribus seculis Westmonasteriense, post il∣lud maxime eminebat. It is likewise of especiall note and reuerend regard, by reason of the con∣secration, the inauguration, and vnction of our kings of England; of which two riming Hexameters are wrought in the cloth of Arras, which adorne the Quire. Hanc Regum sedem sibi Petrus consecrat Edem; Quam tu Papa regis, insignit & vnctio Regis. This Church is also greatly honoured by the glorious Monuments of kings, Queenes, grand Peeres, and others of eminent place and qualitie here interred. And first of all, Sebert the first founder; Sebert king of the East Saxōs with his Queene Aethel∣goda. the sonne of Sledda, and Queene Ricula, the si∣ster of Ethelbert, king of Kent, with his wife Ethelgoda lie here entombed; who died the last day of Iuly, Ann. Dom. 616. hauing raigned 13. yeares. Som 692. yeares after their bodies were translated from their first place of buriall to the South side of the Communion Table, where they rest within a Tombe of lead, with this Epitaph. Labilitas, breuitas mundane prosperitatis Celica premia, gloria, gaudia danda beatis Sebertum certum iure dedere satis. Hic Rex Christicola ver x fuit hac regione, Qui nunc celicola gaudet mercede corone. Rex humilis, docilis, scius, & pius, inclytus iste Sollicite, nitide, tacite, placide, bone christe Vult servire tibi perficiendo sibi. Ornat mores, spernit flores lucis auare, Gliscens multum, christi cultum letificare. Ecclesiam nimiam nimio studio fabricauit. Hec illesa manus que fundamenta locauit; Hic septingentis annisterra cumulatus, Christi clementis instinctibus inde leuatus. Isto sub lapide nunc iacet ipse, vide. Atque domum Christo quia mundo fecit in isto, Nunc pro mercede celi requiescit in ede. Respice mortalis, promissio sit tibi talis. Accipies si des, nil capies nisi des. Es Christo qualis, Christus erit tibi talis, Dapsilis esto sibi, largus eritque tibi. Effectus non affectus si reddere possis, Debet censeri; si nihil reddere possis, Tunc bonus affectus pro facto debet haberi. Sicut de lignis per aquam depellitur ignis. Sic malo commissa fiunt donando remissa. Reddet ad vsuram quod quis dat nomine Christi, Nam vitam puram pro parvo dat Deus isti. His wife Aethelgoda died the 13. of September, Ann. Dom. 615: Vpon the wall by this Tombe, the image of Saint Peter is depicted, spea∣king to king Sebert in these verses. Hic Rex Seberte pausas, mihi condita per te Hec loca lustraui, demum lustrando dicaui. Edward king of England, surnamed the Confessor. Here lieth honourably interred in a marble Tombe, checquered with variety of stones, of beautifull colours; the body of Edward king of Eng¦land, who for his singular pietie was numbred among the Confessors; a principall Founder of this Church. Thus commended by a late writer. . arn r. lb. Engl. Religious, chast, wise, fortunate, stout, franke, and milde was hee, And from all taxes, wrongs, and foes, did set his kingdome free. His Epitaph here inscribed consists of these three Hexameters. Omnibus insignis virtutum landibus Heros, Sanctus Edwardus Confessor, Rex venerandus; Quinto die Iani moriens super Ethera scandit. Sursum corda. Moritur Ann. Dom. 1065. Serlo of Paris hath another Epitaph to his memory in these words. Mss. in bib. Cot. Edwardus probitate potens, pietate verendus, Seque suosque regens rexerat egregius. Formosam faciem procerum corpus habebat, Leticiam vultus moribus exuperans. Hic bello, sic pace suos exterruit hostes Presumpsit pacem rumpere nemo suam. Quinque dies anui reserebat ianua Iani, Cum Rex egrediens carnea templa finit. My old Author Robert of Glocester goes more punctually to the period of his life, the yeares, moneths, weekes, and dayes of his raigne, and time of his buriall. When Seynt Edward hadde thus told, he ganne to clos hys eyghe The iiii dey of Ianuar then gan he deye, In the yer of owr Lord M.lxvi. ryght Aftur that owr swete Lord in hys moder alyght, Kyng he was xxiiii yer, and ii monyethes therto, And three wekes, and vi deyes, r his lyf was ido. Al the Franchyse of Engelond, and al the ioy and blis, Wyth hym faste i beryd was thulke tym I wis; And that men fonde sone aftyrward wyth meny delful cas. Atte Westmynster a twelfth dey this Godeman beryed was. Rob. Glocest. He was for his simplenesse (saith the same Author) i callyd Edward Simple, yet sothe our Lord noryshede hys symplenes, and yaf hym grete grase that men shold be adradde of hym that courhe natte be wrothe, and though men trowed hym to be slow and sim le, he hadde such subiects vndyr hym that atte his hes dauntyd his ene∣myes as Syward Erle of Northumbyrlonde, and Leofricus Erle of Hereforde, that defendyd the kyng euer mor wyth ther manhode, and fauor ayenst the mantenors of Duc Godwy e. Questionle , for sanctitie of life and sweete conuersation, he did farre excell all other Princes; and kings of that disposition are for the most part too soft and pii∣ant (an imperfection in supreme authoritie) to command the turbulent spi∣rits of an vnsetled kingdome; and their vnderstanding too shallow to d ue into the depth of their enemies designes. This Edward was the seuenth sonne of King Etheldred, by Emma his second wife, daughter of Richard the second, Duke of Normandy; he was borne at Islip in the County of Oxford; The first oure of the i gs . he was about fourty yeares of age when he was enthroned in the seat Imperiall. He was the first king of Eng¦land that healed the disease, since called the kings Euill. His wife Editha lieth buried at the North si e of his Tombe, king Edwards wife. who was the daughter of Godwin, that treacherous Earle of Kent; a virgine most chast, whose breast was a schoolehouse of all liberall sciences, milde, mo∣dest, faithfull, innocent, and vnfainedly holy, no way sauouring of her fa∣thers barbarousnesse, being neuer hurtfull to any. Whereupon this verse was applied vnto her, and her father. Sicut Spina Rosam genuit Godwinus Editham: From pricked stalke as sweetest Rose, So Edith faire from Godwin growes. Of which another writeth thus. Godwyne Erle a dawghtyr he hadde, Rob. Glocest. that was of grete fame And of clene lyf also, Edithe was her name. And as the Roos of a brere spryngeth that kene is, Also sprunge this holy mayd of liche kynd I wis. She died in December, 1074. in the eight yeare of her widowhood, and in the eight yeare of the Conquerours raigne. Professing vpon her death∣bed, that notwithstanding she had beene king Edwards wife the space of eighteene yeares, yet she died a pure Virgine. For this, king Edward (not without reason) is taxed, in that he vnder a godly pretext of Religion, and vowed virginitie, cast off all care of hauing issue, and exposed the kingdome to the prey of ambitious humours. Yet some, that would excuse him in this, affirme, that this holy king was not willing to beget any heires, that should succeed him out of a treacherous race. Here lieth, Maud wife to king Henry the first. without any Tombe, Maude, daughter to Malcolm Camoir, king of Scots, and wife to king Henry the first; who brought vnto him children, William, Richard, and Mary, which perished by shipwracke, and Maud Empresse, who was wise to Henry the fift Emperour. She died the first day of May: Maij prima dies nostrorum nocte dierum, raptam perpetua fecit inesse die, Ex Mss. in bib. Cot. 1118. She had an excellent Epigram made to her commen∣dation whereof these foure verses onely remaine. Prospera non laetam fecere, nec aspera tristem, Aspera risus erant, prospera terror erant. Non decor effecit fragilem, non sceptra superbam; Sola potens humilis, sola pudica decens. Thus paraphrastically translated. No prosperous state did make her glad; Nor aduerse chances made her sad. If Fortune frown'd she then did smile, If Fortune smil'd, she fear'd the while. If Beauty tempted, she said nay; No pride she tooke in Scepters sway. She onely high her selfe debast; A Lady onely faire and chast. She went euery day in the Lent time to this Church bare-foot, and bare-legd, wearing a garment of haire; she would wash and kisse the feet of the poorest people, and giue them bountifull Almes. For which being repre∣hended by a Courtier, shee gaue him a short answer, which I haue out of Robert of Glocester. The Courti∣ers speech. Madame for Goddes love is this wel i doo To handle sich vnclene ymmes, and to kisse so Foule wolde the kyng thynk if that hit he wiste, And ryght wel abyse hym er he your mouth kiste, The Queenes answer. Sur sur qd the Quene be stille why sayste thow so Owr Lord hymself ensample yaf so for to do. She founded (as I haue said before) the Priory of Christ-church within Aldgate, and the Hospitall of S. Giles in the Fields. She builded the Bridges ouer the Riuer of Lea at Stratford Bow, and ouer the little Brooke called Chanelsebridge; shee gaue much likewise to the repairing of high-wayes. But I will take my leaue of her with these words of Paris: Mat. Paris ad Ann. 1118. Obijt eodem anno Matildis Regina Anglorum cuius corpus apud Westmonasterium quietem se∣pulturae accepit, & anima eius se coelum possidere evidentibus signis et mira∣culis crebris ostendit. King Henry the third. Here lieth vnder a rich Monument of Porphery, adorned with precious stones, the body of Henry the third, king of England. In the fifth yeare of whose raigne, and the Saturday next before his second time of Coronation, the New worke (the old being ruinous and pulled downe) of this Church of Westminster, Mat. West. was begun. To which sacred Edifice this king was a per∣swader: he was the Founder, and laid the first stone in the ground-worke of the building. Rob. Glocest. The Newerke atte Westmynstre ye kyng tho ganne anone, Aftyr hys coronyng and leyde the fyrst stone. As if he meant the world should know, his intention was to consecrate his future actions to the glory of God. He gaue to this Church royall gifts of Copes, Iewels, and rich vessels: and for the holy Reliques of Edward the Confessor, he caused a coffin to be made of pure gold and pretious stones, and so artificially by the most cunning Goldsmiths that could be gotten; that although the matter it was made of, was of an inestimable valew, ta∣men Materiam superabat opus, yet the workmanship excelled the matter, saith Mathew Paris. A Prince he was, as our histories affirme, of greater deuotion then discretion, in permitting the depredation of himselfe and his subiects by papall ouerswayings. This King (saith Robert of Glocester ) as in worldlich doyng was not hald ful wyse, but mor deuout to spiritual things; he was euery dey woned to here thre Masses by note. Quante innocentie, quante patientie, quanteque deuotionis, et quanti meriti in vita sua erat apud Deum, testantur post ipsius mortem miracula subsecuta: Of how much integrity, of how much patience, of how much deuotion, and of how much merite he was in his life time before God, the miracles which followed after his death, doe testifie, saith the compendi∣ous chronicle of Canterbury. He died the 16 of Nouember 1273. when he liued sixty fiue yeares, Mss. in bib. Cot and raigned fiftie sixe yeares, and eighteene daies, this Epitaph following is an∣nexed to his Tombe. Tertius Henricus iacet hic pietatis amicus Ecclesiam strauit istam, quam post renouauit Reddet ei munus qui regnat trinus et vnus: Tertius Henricus est Templi conditor huius. Dulce bellum inexpertis. Which is thus Englished by Robert Fabian.

At the head of the foresaid King Henry, his sonne Edward, surnamed Long-Shanks, lieth entombed; King of England, the first of that Christian name since the Conquest: and as he was the first of his name, so was he the first that setled the law and state, Sir Rob. . deseruing the stile of Englands Iustinian, and freed this kingdome from the wardship of the Peeres; shewing him∣selfe in all his actions after, capable to command not the Realme onely, but the whole world. At the time of his Fathers death, he was abroad in Palestine, pursuing his high desires for the Holy Warres, and after sixe yeares, from his first setting out, he returnes into England, receiues the Crowne (without which he had beene a King almost three yeares) at the hands of Robert, Arch∣bishop of Canterbury; and with him is Eleanor his vertuous Queene, like∣wise crowned at Westminster. To the which their magnificent pompous Coronations, the presence of Alexander, King of Scotland, (who had married Margaret his eldest sister) was required, as appeares by this Re∣cord following. Ex.

The said King Alexander comes accordingly to his Brothers Coronati∣on (which was in September 1275) guarded with a goodly troupe of Knights and Gentlemen; at which solemnity also were present, Iohn, Duke of Britaine, who had married Beatrice his second sister; Eleanor his mother, with multitudes of Peeres and others: and for the more royall celebration of this great Feast, and honour of so martiall a King, there were fiue hun∣dreth great horses let loose, euery one to take them for his owne, who could. Of which, out of an old oreworne Manuscript, a piece as follow∣eth. King Edward was coronyd and anoyntyd as ryghte heyre of Engelond, withe moche honor and worsschyp. And aftur Masse, the Kyng went to hys Paleys for to holde a ryall feste, amonges them that hym had doon seruyse and worsschyp. And whanne he was set at hys mete, Kyng Alexandre of Scotland come to doo hym seruyse and worsschyp wyth a queyntyse, and an hondryd knyghtes with hym, horsed and arayd. And whanne they weren lyght of theyr horse, they let theyr horse goon whether they wolde, and they that wolde take them, hadde them to their owne behofe, wythoute any chalange. And aftyr that come Syr Edmond King Edwardes Broder, a curtayse Knyght and a gentyll of ren on, and the Erle of Cornwayle, and the Erle of Glowcesire. And aftyr theym come the Erle of Penbroke, and the Erle of Warren, and eche of them ledde on theyr hondes be them selfe an hordryd knights, disgyse in their armes. And whan they weren alyght of their horse, they lete them goo whedyr they wolde, and they that cowde them take, hadde them stylle at theyr owne lyking. And whanne all this was doon, Kyng Edward dyd hys dyligens and hys myght to amende the Relme, and redresse the wronges in the best maner, to the honor of God, and profyte to the crowne, and to holy cherche, and to amende the anoyance of the comon peple. The worthiest knyght he was of alle the world of honor and worsschyp, for the grace of God was in hym, and euer hadde the vyctory of hys enemyes. Expugnauit Saracenos, Chron. Compend. Cant. Mss. in bib. Cot. Francos, Scotos, Wallenses et perfidos christianos; et quicquid regale glorie et honori tam in actibus quam in moribus competit in ipso potuit reperiri. He vanquished the Sarasines, the French, the Scots, the Welsh, and perfidious Christians, and whatsoeuer appertained to Re∣gall glory and honour, as well in actions as in condition, state, and prince∣ly deportment, was in him to be found. Dum vi it Rex, et valuit sua magna potestas, Fraus latuit, pax magna fuit, regnauit honestas. Saith an old Latin Rimer of this King; which is thus translated into the like English.

Scotos Edward dum vixit suppeditauit Tenuit, afflixit, depressit, dilaniauit. Whilst Edward liu'd, the Scots he still kept vnder, Bridled, deprest, debased, rent asunder. Yet here giue me leaue to tell my Reader, (maugre this our English Ri∣mer) that the valiant Scots did not alwaies suffer King Edward to scape scotfree; for hee laying siege to the strong Towne of Berwicke, they defended it manfully, bet the English men backe, and burnt some of the English Ships; vpon which their fortunate enterprise in derision of our King, they made this mockish rime doggerell.

This scornefull dittie came no sooner to king Edwards eares, then that through his mighty strength, he passed dikes, assailed the Towne, and wan it with the death of fifteene thousand Scots, S.

Vpon these victories, king Edward endeauours to extinguish, if it were possible, the very memory of the Nation: abolishing all their ancient lawes; tradu∣cing their Ecclesiasticall rites, to the custome of England: dispoiling them of their Histories; their instruments of State: their antique monuments, left either by the Romanes, or erected by themselues, transporting all their Bookes and Bookemen into England.

And for a grete Iewyll long hit was yholde ther, Kyng Edward wyth the lang Shankes fro Scotland hit fette Besyde the Shryne of Seynt Edward at Westminstre h te s tte. Vpon the Chaire wherein the stone is inclosed, this famous propheticall Distichon is inscribed. Ni fallat vatum Scoti hunc quocunque locatum Invenient lapidem, regnare tenentur ibidem. If Fates goe right where ere this stone is pight, The Regall race of Scots shall rule that place. Which, by whomsoeuer it was written, we, who now liue, finde it happily accomplished. Of the worthinesse of this our matchlesse King, will it please you heare a little from a late Writer, namely, M. Drayton, in the seuenteenth Song of Polyolbion. Henry the third. This long-liu'd Prince expyr'd: the next succeeded; he Of vs, that for a God might well related be. Our Longshanks, Scotlands scourge, who to the Orcads taught His Scepter, and with him from wilde Albania brought, The reliques of her Crowne (by him first placed here) Henry the third. The seate on which her Kings inaugurated were. He tam'd the desperate Welsh, that out so long had stood, And made them take a Prince sprong of the English blood. This Isle from Sea to Sea, he generally controld, And made the other parts of England both to hold. The learned Antiquarie and Lawyer, Iohn Selden, in his Illustrations vpon the said Song, giues vs this Glosse following vpon the Verse. The seate on which our Kings inaugurated were. This seate (saith he) is the Chaire and Stone at Westminster, whereon our Soueraignes are inaugurated. The Scottish Stories affirme, that the Stone was first in Gallicia of Spaine at Brigantia (whether that be Compo∣stella, as Francis Tarapha wills, or Coronna, as Florian del Campo conie∣ctures, or Betansos according to Mariana, I cannot determine) where Gathel, king of Scots there, sate on it as his Throne. Thence was it brought into Ireland by Simon Brech, first king of Scots, transplanted into that Isle, about seuen hundred yeares before Christ. Out of Ireland, King Ferguze (in him by some is the beginning of the now continuing Scottish raigne) about three hundred and seuenty yeares afterward brought it into Scotland. King Kenneth some eight hundred and fifty of the Incarnation, placed it at the Abbey of Scone (in the Shrifdome of Perth) where the Coronation of his Successours was vsuall, as of our Monarchs now at Westminster; and in the Saxon times at Kingston vpon Thames. This Kenneth, some say, caused the Distich. The fatall Marble. Ni fallat vatum, as before, to be engrauen vpon it. Whereupon it is called Fatale Marmor in Hector Boetius, and inclosed it in a wodden Chaire. It is now at Westminster, and on it are the Coronations of our Soueraignes: Thither first brought (as the Author here speakes) among other spoiles, by Edward Longshanks, after his warres and victories against King Iohn Balliol, Ann. 1297. Reg. Regis Ed. 1.24. Thus much of this po∣tent king out of Polyolbion. But to returne, these high spirited Scots (then which no people in the world are more valiant) not minding to endure the tyranny of King Ed∣ward, entred into England at seuerall times; and in Northumberland and Cumberland, The cruelty of the Scots. slew the aged and impotent, women in childbed, and young children; spoiled the Abbey Church at Hexham, and got a great number of the Clergie, as well Monkes, Priests, as Schollers, whom they thrust into the Schoolehouse there, Rich Southwell. Ho inshead. and closing vp the doores, set fire on the Schoole, and burned all them to ashes that were within it. They burned Churches, they forced women without respect of order, condition, or qualitie, as well the maids, widowes, and wiues, as Nunnes, that were reputed in those dayes consecrated to God, & when they had beene so abused, many of them were after murthered. So that the cruell and bloudy desolation whereof Lucan speaketh in his second booke of the Pharsalian warres, may aptly be infer∣red here, as fitly describing the mercilesse murther of all states and sexes, without partiality, vnder the hand of the enemy. For, saith he, Nobilitas cum plebe perit, lateque vagatur Ensis, & a nullo revocatum est pectore ferrum, Stat cruor in templis, multaque rubentia caede Lubrica saxa madent, nulli iam prosuit aetas, Non senis extremum piguit vergentibus annis Praecipitasse diem, non primo in limine vitae Infantis miseri nascentia rumpere fata. Thus exquisitely translated into English. Senatours with Plebeians lost their breath, ro. May. The sword rag'd vncontrold: no brest was free: The Temples stainde with bloud, and slippery Were the red stones with slaughter: no age then Was free: the neere spent time of aged men They hastened on; nor sham'de with bloudy knife, To cut the Infants new spunne thread of life. Bloud worthy to haue beene shed on both sides, against another kinde of enemy, then Christians: the deformity of which effusions, may iustly re∣present vnto vs the blessed estate of our now setled Vnion. Ranulph the Monke of Chester, speakes somewhat more succinctly of the warlike passages in those times, betwixt the puissant braue English, and the terrible neuer-tamed Scot on this manner; I will vse the old language of his Translatour Treuisa, who flourished in the raigne of king Henry the sixth. Polychron. l. 7. cap. 40. Iohn de Baillol (saith he) that was made kyng of Scotlond, aroos ayenst the kynge of Englonde, and ayenste his owne othe; and by the counseylle of some men of Scotland, and namely of thabbot of M ros, was taken and dysheryted. Then the yere after Willi m of Scottes arayed werre ayenste kynge Edwarde, but he was se∣cond yere after; Kynge Edwarde slew x and Scottes on a Mary Mawdelyn day. But the Scottes w x d stronger and stronger ty yeres togyder, vnto kyng Edwardes tyme the thyrd after the and bete down Englyshemen of , and Englysh places that were her Marches. Some sayd that that myshappe fell for so nesse of the Englyshe men▪ And some said that it was goddis owne wer he as the That Englyshe men sholde be destroyed by Danes, by Fren he men, by Scottes. Of this propheticall prediction I haue spoken elsewhere, which that of the marble stone) vpon the inauguration of our late Souer Lord King Iames, of happie memory, in his Regall Chaire of Impe gouernment, had full accomplishment. The period of the dayes, as also the character of this magnificent Mo¦narch Edward, are thus deliuered by a late Writer. In Iuly, 1307 although he found himselfe not well, he enter; Scotland with a fresh Army, which he led not arre; for falling into a Dissenterie, he dies at Borough vpon the sand , as if to show on what foundation h d built all his glory in this world: hauing raigned thirty foure yeares, seuen moneths, aged sixty eight. A Prince of a generous spirit, wherein the fire held out euen to the very last: borne and bred for action and militarie af faires, which he mannaged with great iudgement: euer warie and proui∣dent for his owne businesse: watchfull and eager to enlarge his power: and was more for the greatnesse of England, then the quiet thereof. And this we may iustly say of him, that neuer king before, or since, shed so much Christian bloud within this Isle of Britaine, as this C ristian warrior did his time, and was the cause of much more in that following. By our great and iudicious Antiquary Camden, he is thus , as followeth. For no one thing was this little Burgh vpon Sands more famous, than, that King Edward the first, that triumphant Conquerour of his enemies, was here taken out of the world by vntimely death A ight noble and wor∣thy Prince, to whom God proportioned a most princely presence and per∣sonage, as a right worthy seat to entertaine so heroicall a minde For he not onely in regard of fortitude and wisedome, but also for a beautifull and per∣sonall presence was in all points answerable to the height of Royall Maie∣stie, whom fortune also in the very Prime and flower of his age, inured to many a warre, and exercised in most dangerous troubles of the state, whiles she framed and fitted him for the Empire of Britaine; which he, being once crowned King, mannaged and gouerned in such wise, that hauing subdued the Welsh, and vanquished the Scots, hee may most iustly bee counted a chiefe ornament and honour of Britaine. Amongst other admonitions and precepts, which he gaue to his sonne Edward (after him king of England) vpon his death bed he charged him, of a singham. that he should carry his Fathers bones about with him in some Coffin, till he had marched through all Scotland, and subdued all his enemies, for that none should bee able to ouercome him while his Skeleton marched with him: thinking, belike, that the care to preserue them from enemies would make a Sonne fight nobly. Moreouer he commanded the said Prince, That whereas himselfe, by the continuall new attempts of Bruce, king of Scot∣land, could not in person (according to his vow) make warre in the Holy∣land, therefore he should send his Heart thither, accompanied with seuen∣score knights, and their retinues, for whose support he had prouided thirty and two thousand pounds of siluer. That his Heart being so by them con∣uayed, he did hope in God, that all things there would prosper with them. Lastly, That vpon paine of eternall damnation, the said money should not be expended vpon any other vses. Walsing. Sed filius immorigerus patris mandata negligit: But the disobedient Sonne little regarded the commandement of his Father. He died the seuenth of Iuly, the yeare aforesaid; his body was conuayed to this Abbey, and accompanied most of the way with the Popes Legate, the reuerend Bishops, and most of the English Nobilitie, where it was in∣terred with that state as became the person of so potent a Prince; The dead bo∣dies of our English kings (anciently) preserued from corruption. And such was the care of his Successours, to keepe his body from corruption, as that the Searecloth wherein his embalmed body was enwrapt, was often re∣newed, as doth appeare vpon Record thus.

Mors est inesta nimis magnos que iungit in imis, Maxima mors minimis coniungens vltima primis; Nullus in orbe fuit homo viuens nec valet esse Qui non morte ruit: est hinc exire necesse. Nobilis & fortis, tibi tu considere noli, Omnia sunt mortis, sibi subdit singula soli, De mundi medio magnum mors impia mouit, Anglia pre tedio satis anxia plangere novit: Corruit Edwardus vario veneratus honore, Rex nuper vt Nardus fragrans virtutis odore, Corde Leopardus, invictus & absque pauore, Ad rixam tardus, discretus, & eucharis ore. Viribus armorum quasi Gigas ardua gessit, Colla superborum prudens per prelia pressit, Inter Flandrenses fortuna sibi bene fauit, Vt quoque Wallenses & Scotos suppeditauit. Rex bonus absque pari strenue sua regna regebat. Quod natura dari potuit bonitatis habebat. Actio iustitie, pax regni, sanctio legis, Et fuga nequitie premunt precordia Regis. Gloria tota ruit, Regem capit hec modo fossa, Rex quandoque fuit, nunc nil nisi puluis et ossa: Filius ipse Dei quem corde colebat et ore, Gaudia fecit ei nullo permista dolore. The which verses (saith Fabian ) to the entent that they should be had in minde, and also that the reader might haue the more desire to ouer-reade them; I haue therefore set them out in Baladde Royall, after my rude ma∣king as followeth. This sorrowfull deth which bryngeth great full low, Fabians Ballad Royall. And moost and leest he ioyneth into one, Thys man to whome his pere was not y knowe Hath now subdued, nat sparyng hym alone, Whyche of all order thys world to ouergone, None was to be spared, of so great equyte As he, yf any, for noblesse spared shuld be. Therfore thou noble or myghty, trust none oder grace, But thou shalt pay to deth thy naturall dette; And lyke as he from thys world did chace Thys mighty Prynce, and from his frendys fette, For whome all Englond loude mourned and grette: So shalt thou and oder in deths snare fall, None shall escape, to reckyn kyndes all. Edward wyth many and dyuers graces endowed, And like as Nardus most sweetest of odoure, In smellynge passyth, and moost he is allowed Of all swete odours, so dyd this knyghtly floure By vertuous artes surmounte in honoure, All oder Prynces; whose hert was Lybar delyke, And without fere, were he hole or syke. Thys Prynce was slowe to all maner of stryfe, Discrete, and wise, and trewe of his worde, In armys a Geaunt, terme of all his lyfe, Excelling actes doing by dynte of the sworde, Subduyd the proud, of prudence he bore the horde, Of Flaunders by fate he had great amyte, And Walshe, and Scottes, by strength subduyd he. This good King perelesse, his landes firmly gyded, What nature might giue he failed in nothynge, No parte of bounte from his was discided, He was iustice, and peace, and of lawe stablishyng, And chaser of iniquyte by his vertuous liuyng: In whome these graces with innumerable mo, Fermly were roted, that deth hath tane vs fro. That whylom was a Kyng, now is but duste and bone, All glory is fallen, and this pitte kepeth the kynge, But he that yeldeth all thing by his one, The Sonne of God, to whom aboue all thynge With herte and mouth he did all worsshyppyng, That Lord of his ioy perdurable to laste, Graunt him sorrowlesse euermore to taste. All Kings haue long hands, alluding to the extensure of their Regall go∣uernement, of which Ouid in one of his Epistles: thus, An nescis longas Regibus esse manus? This King had also long legges, and, a longis tibijs, surnamed hee was Longshankes. But I stray beyond my limits, his vertues haue taken me pri∣soner, and detained me much longer then I expected; let me take liberty to conclude with these verses, in commendation of his valour, out of the fore-remembred additions to Robert of Glocester.

Queen of England. Here lieth entombed, Eleanor his first wife, Queene of England, who went with him into the holy land, in which voyage her husband was stab∣bed with a poysoned dagger by a Sarazen, the rankled wound whereof was iudged incurable by his Physitians, yet shee daily and nightly sucked out the ranke poison, and so by aduenturing her owne, saued her husbands life. She was the onely daughter of Ferdinando, the third King of Castile and Leons: she died at Herdby in Lincolnshire, 29 Nouember 1290. hauing beene King Edwards wife 36 yeares, who erected to her honour those Cros∣ses, as Statues, at Lincolne, Grantham, Stanford, Geddington, Northamp∣ton, Stony Stratford, Dunstable, (now destroyed) Saint Albans, Wal∣tham, and Westminster, called Charing-Crosse, all adorned with the armes of Castile, Leon, and the Earldome or Countie of Ponthieu, which by her right was annexed to the Crowne of England. Moreouer the said King Ed∣ward (so ardent was his affection to the memory of his deceased Eleanor ) gaue twelue Mannors, Lordships, and Hamlets, to Walter then Abbot of Westminster, and his successors for euer, for the keeping of yeerely Obits for his said Queene, and for money that should be geeuen to the poore, that came to the solemnization of the same. Her Epitaph. Nobilis Hispani iacet hic soror inclita Regis, Eximij consors Eleanora thori. Edwardi primi Wallorum principis vxor, Cui pater Henricus tertius Anglus erat. Hanc ille vxorem gnato petit: omine princeps Legati munus suscipit ipse bono, Alfonso Fratri placuit felix Hymeneus, Germanam Edwardo nec sine dote dedit. Dos preclara fuit, nec tali indigna marito Pontino Princeps munere diues erat. Femina consilio prudens, pia, prole beata; Auxit amicitijs, auxit honore virum. Disce mori. Here lieth gloriously entombed, Edward the third King of England. the most mighty Monarch that euer ware the Crowne of England, who conquered Calis, recouered Aquitaine and Normandy, tooke Iohn, King of France, and Dauid King of Scots, pri∣soners; added the armes and title of France to his owne, declaring his claime in this kind of verse: thus, Rex sum regnorum bina ratione duorum, Remaines. Anglorum Regno sum Rex ego iure paterno; Matris iure quidem Francorum nuncupor idem. Hinc est Armorum variatio facta meorum. To which the French answered scornefully in verses to the same tem∣per, but some what touching Edward with ill grounded vanitie, pretending right to the Crown of France, by Queen Isabell his mother: before whom, (if Daughters should succeed in the sacred Lillies of France) her eldest Si∣ster must march, Madam Margaret of France, wife to Ferdinand, fourth of that name, King of Castille. Praedo Regnorum qui diceris esse duorum, Fauine in the orders of En∣gland. Francorum Regno priuaberis, atque Paterno. Matris vbique nullum Ius Broles non habet vllum, Iure Mariti carens alia est Mulier prior illa. Succedunt Mares huic Regno non Mulieres. Hinc est Armorum variatio stulta tuorum. He excelled his Ancestors also in the victorious valour of his children; in their obedience to him, and loue among themselues; and one of his grea∣test felicities was, that he had a Lady to his wife (the fruitfull mother of a faire issue) of such excellent vertue and gouernement, as that then King Ed∣wards Fortunes seemed to fall into Eclipse when she was hidden in her Se∣pulchre. He was the sonne of Edward the second by Isabel, daughter to Phi∣lip the Faire, King of France; his father being amoued from the kingdomes gouernement, (against whom he had no guilty thought) he was by pub∣like Sanction thereupon established in the royall Throne, being of the age of fourteene yeeres; and when he had raigned 50 yeeres, died at his Manor of Shine, Iune 21. 1377. these verses are annexed to his monument.

Tertius Edwardus Fama super ethera notus pugna pro patria. Foure of these verses are thus translated by Speed in his History of the said King, where, vpon the words Pollens bellis Machabeum he giues this marginall note, as followeth. He meanes (saith he) more able in battaile, then Machabeus ; you must beare with the breaking of Priscians head, for it is written of a King that vsed to breake many.

Hic vero Edwardus quamuis in hostes terribilis extiterat, in subditos tamen mitissi∣mus fuerat et gratiosus, pietate et miserecordia omnes pene suos precellens an∣tecessores. Sam. Daniel. A late writer saith, hee was a Prince the soonest a man, and the longest that held so, of any we reade; he was of personage comely, of an euen sta∣ture, gracefull, respectiuely affable, and well expressing himselfe. A Prince who loued Iustice, Order, and his people, the supreme vertues of a Soue∣raigne. First his loue of Iustice, His Iustice. was seene by the many Statutes hee made for the due execution thereof, and the most straight-binding oath, hee or∣dained to be ministred vnto his Iudges and Iusticiars: the punishment in∣flicted on them for corruption in their offices, causing some to be thrust out, and others grieuously fined. He bettered also that forme of publique Iustice which his Grandfather first began (and which remaines to this day) ma∣king also excellent Lawes for the same. His regard of Order. His regard to the obseruation of Order among his people, so many Lawes do witnesse, as were made to re∣straine them from Excesses in all kinds. His loue to his Subiects, His loue to his people. was exprest in the often easing of their grieuances, and his willingnesse to giue them all faire satisfaction, as appeares by the continuall granting of the due obser∣uation of their Charters in most of his Parliaments. And when ( Ann. Reg. 14.) they were iealous, vpon his assuming the title of the kingdome of France, lest England should thereby come to bee vnder the subiection of that Crowne, as being the greater, he to cleare them of that doubt, passed a Statute, in the firmest manner could bee deuised, that this kingdome should remaine intire as before, without any violation of the rights it had. Prouident he was in all his actions, His Proui∣dence. neuer vnder-taking any thing before he had first furnished himselfe with meanes to performe it. For his gifts we finde them not such as either his owne fame and repu∣tation, or any way distasted the State. To be short, hee was a Prince who knew his worke, and did it: and therefore was he better obeyed, better re∣spected and serued, then any of his Predecessours. His workes of Pietie were great and many, His works of Pietie. as the founding of East-min∣ster an Abbey (of the Cisteux order) neare the Tower. An Abbey for Nunnes at Dartford in Kent (of both which I haue already written) The Kings Hall in Cambridge for poore Schollers. An Hospitall for the poore at Calais. The building of Saint Stephens Chappell at Westminster, with the endowment of three hundred pound, per annum, to that Church. His augmenting the Chappell at Windsore, and prouisions there for Church∣men, and twenty foure poore knights, His buildings. &c. These were his publique works, the best Monuments and most lasting to glorifie the memory of Princes. Besides these, his priuate buildings are great and many; as the Castle of Windsore, which he re-edified and enlarged. His magnificence was shewed in Triumphs and Feasts, which were sumptuously celebrated, with all due rites and ceremonies, the preseruers of Reuerence and Maiestie: To conclude, he was a Prince, whose nature agreed with his office, as onely made for it. On this manner, as he was in the strength of his yeares, and in the height of his vigorous actions, his character is exprest by many Authors. Now may it please you in this place to take a view of this the mighty great Mo∣narch of England, France, and Ireland, as he was wrinkled with age, weak∣ened with a sore lingring disease, and laid downe vpon his Deaths-bed. When he had attained to the age of threescore and fiue yeares, or there∣abouts, and wrastled with a sicknesse which gaue him the ouerthrow; ly∣ing in the bed, and at the point of death, his eyes darkened, his speech al∣tered, and his naturall heate almost extinguished, Walsing. in vit. Ed. 3. one, whom of all other he most entirely affected, tooke the rings from his fingers, which for the roy∣altie of his Maiestie he was wont to weare, so bad him adiew; and with∣drew herselfe into another roome (a woman she was, inuerecunda p llex, as Walsingham calls her, whose name was Alice Piers ) neither was hee left onely of her the said Alice, but of other the knights and Esquires, who had serued him, allured more with his gifts then his loue. Amongst many there was onely present at that time a certaine Priest (other of his seruants applying the spoile of what they could lay hands on) who lamenting the kings miserie, and inwardly touched with griefe of heart, for that amongst so many Councellers which hee had, there was none that would minister vnto him the word of life, came boldly vnto him, and admonished him to lift vp the eyes as well of his body, as of his heart, vnto God, and with sighes to aske mercy of him, whose Maiestie he well knew he had grieuous∣ly offended. Whereupon the king listened to the words of the Priest, and although a little before he had wanted the vse of his tongue, yet then taking strength to him, hee seemed to speake what was in his minde. And then what for weaknesse of his body, contrition of his heart, and sobbing for his sinnes, his voice and speech failed him, and scarce halfe pronouncing this word Iesu, he gaue vp the Ghost, at his Mannour of Sheene (now Rich∣mount) as aforesaid. If you will heare any more of this Martiall king, you must haue the pa∣tience to trouble your selues in the reading of these obsolete old rimes. Aftur Add. Rob.

Edward the third through mothers will, and Nobles good consent; Tooke her to wife, and ioyfully with her his time he spent. His brother Iohn a Martiall man, and eke a valiant knight, Did linke this woman to this king in bonds of marriage right. This match and marriage thus in bloud, did binde the Flemings sure To Englishmen, by which they did the Frenchmens wracke procure. This Philip flowr'd in gifts full rare, and treasures of the minde, In beauty bright, Religion, Faith; to all and each most kinde, A fruitfull Mother Philip was, full many a sonne she bred, And brought forth many a worthy knight, hardy, and full of dred. A carefull Nurse to Students all, at Oxford she did found Queenes Colledge, and Dame Pallas Schoole, that did her fame resound. The wife of Edward, deere, Queene Philip lieth here: Learne to liue. She was the youngest of the fiue daughters of William Earle of Henault aforesaid; especially chosen before any of her Sisters for king Edwards wife, by a Bishop (of what See I am vncertaine) and other Lords tempo∣rall, sent thither, were sent as Embassadours, to treate of the marriage. Of which thus much out of Harding. cap. 178. as followeth. He sent furth than, to Henauld for a wife, A Bishop, and other Lordes temporall, Wher in Chaumbre prevy and secretife, At discouerit dischenely also in all, As semyng was to estate Virginall Emong theim selfes, our lordes for hie prudence Of the Bishop asked counsaill and sentence. Whiche daughter of fiue should be the Queene, Who counsailled thus, with sad auisement, Wee will haue hir with good hippis I mene, For she will bere good soonnes at myne entent; To which thei all accorded by one assent, And chase Philip, that was full feminine, As the Bishop moost wise did determine. But then emong theim selfes thei laugh fast ay, The lordes than saied, the Bishop couth Full mekill skill of a woman al way, That so couth chese a lady that was vncouth, And for the mery woordes that came of his mouth Thei trowed he had right great experience Of womanes rule and hir conuenience. Now, what experience this Bishop had in womens conueniency of brin∣ging forth children, I know not, but it so fell out, that she had issue by her said husband King Edward, seuen sonnes, and fiue daughters, borne for the glory of our Nation. 1. Edward Prince of Wales, borne at Woodstocke. 2. William, borne at Hatfield, in the County of Hertford. 3. Lionell, borne at the Citie of Antwerpe, Duke of Clarence. 4. Iohn, borne at Gaunt, the chiefe Towne of Flanders, Duke of Lan∣caster. 5. Edmond, surnamed of Langley, Duke of Yorke. 6. William, another of their Sonnes, surnamed of Windsore, where he was borne. 7. Thomas, the youngest sonne of King Edward and Queene Philip, sur∣named of Woodstocke, the place of his birth, Duke of Glocester. Daughters. 1. Isabell, the eldest Daughter, was married with great pompe at Wind∣sore, to Ingelram of Guisnes, Lord of Coucy, Earle of Soissoms, and after Archduke of Austria, whom king Edward his Father in law created also Earle of Bedford. 2. Ioane, desired in marriage by solemne Embassage from Alphons, king of Castile and Leon, sonne of king Ferdinando the fourth, was espoused by Proxie, intituled Queene of Spaine, conueyed into that countrey, where she presently deceased of a great plague that then raigned. 3. Blanch the third daughter, died young, and lieth buried in this Abbey Church. 4. Mary the fourth daughter was married to Iohn Montford, Duke of Britaine. 5. Margaret their youngest daughter was the first wife of Iohn de Hast∣ings, Earle of Penbroke. It is reported of this Queene (saith Milles ) that when she perceiued her life would en , she requested to speake with the King her husband, who accordingly came to her in great heauinesse: being come, she tooke him by the hand, and after a few words of induction, shee prayed him that hee would in no wise deny her, in three requests. First, that all Merchants and others to whom she ought any debt, (whether on this side or beyond the seas) might be payd and discharged. Secondly, that all such promises as she had made to Churches, as well within the realme as without, might be performed. Thirdly, that hee would be pleased (whensoeuer God should call him,) to chuse none other Sepulchre, but that wherein her body should be layed: all which were performed, and so I leaue them both lying in one Graue, expecting a ioyfull resurrection. Richard the second, Richard the se∣cond, King of England. King of England and France, Lord of Ireland, sonne to Edward, Prince of Wales, by Ioane, daughter to the Earle of Kent, be∣ing depriued both of liuing and life, by that popular vsurper Henry the by his commandement, obscurely buried at Langley in Hert∣fortshire, in the Church of the Friers Predicants; was by the appointment of Henry the fift, remoued from thence with great honour, in a Chaire roy∣all, himselfe and his nobilitie attending the sacred reliques of this annointed King: which he solemnly here enterred amongst his ancestors, and foun∣ded perpetually one day euery weeke, a Dirge, with nine Lessons and a morning masse to be celebrated for the soule of the said King Richard, Ranulph, Monke of Chester. Lib. vltimo. and vpon each of those daies, sixe shillings eight pence to be giuen to the poore people; and once euery yeare vpon the same day of his Anniuerse, twentie pounds in pence to be distributed to the most needfull: He made for him a glorious Tombe, and this glosing Epitaph deciphering the lineaments of his body, and qualities of mind; which to any, who knowes vpon what points he was put out of Maiestie and State, may seeme strange, if not ridi∣culous; thus it runnes. Prudens et mundus Richardus iure secundus, Per fatum victus, iacet hic sub marmore pictus. Verax sermone, prudens suit et ratione. Corpore procerus, animo prudens vt Homerus, Ecclesie fauit, elatos suppeditauit. Quemuis prostrauit Regalia qui violauit. O bruit hereticos, et eorum strauit amicos. O clemens christe tibi deuotus suit iste Votis Baptiste, salues quem protulit iste. Hic iacet immiti consumptus morte Richardus fuisse felicem miserrimum. Fabian who translated this Epitaph into English, Folio 166. desirous, as it seemes, to extenuate the force of such palpable grosse flattery; annexeth this stanza. But yet, alas, although this meter, or ryme, Thus doth embellish this noble Princes fame; And that some Clerke which fauored him somtyme, L st by his cunnyng thus to enhanse his name, Yet by his story appereth in him some blame. Wherfore to Princes is surest memory, Their lyues to exercyse in vertuous constancy. But Iohn Harding, speaking of the greatnesse of his houshold, and the pride and whoredome therein, as well amongst the Clergie as Laitie, is more inuectiue in his rimes, which to reade I hope will not be troublesome: thus he begins. Truly I herd Robert Ireleffe saye Clerke of the Grenecloth; and that to the Houshold Came euery daye, forthe most partie alwaye Ten thousand folke, by his messis told, That folowed the hous aye as thei wold. And in the Kechin three hundred Seruitours, And in eche office many occupiours. And Ladies faire, with their gentlewomen, Chamberers also and lauenders, Three hundred of theim were occupied then. There was greate pride emong the Officers. And of all men far passyng their compeers, Of rich araye, and much more costious, Then was before, or sith, and more pretious. In his Chappell, were Bishoppes then of Bohemia. Beame, Some of Irelond, and some also of France; Some of Englond, and clerkes of many a realme, That litill connyng had or conisance. In musike honorably God his seruice to auance In the Chappell, or in holy Scripture On mater of Goddis to refigure. Lewed menne, thei were in clerkes clothyng, Disguysed faire, in fourme of clerkes wise, Their Perishyns full litill enfourmyng In Lawe diuine, or else in God his seruise. But right practyfe they were in couetise Eche yere to make full greate collection At home, in stede of soules correction. Greate Lechery and fornication Was in that house, and also greate aduoutree. Of Paramours was great consolacion, Of ech degre, well more of Prelacie Then of the temporall, or of the chiualrie. Greate taxe ay the kyng tooke through all the lond, For whiche Commons him hated both free and bond. Iohn Gower concludes his cronica tripartita, annexed to his booke entitu∣led Vox Clamantis, with these riming verses concerning the said King. Cronica Richardi qui sceptra tulit Leopardi Vt patet est dicta, populo sed non benedicta Vt speculum mundi quo lux nequit vlla resundi, Sic vacuus transit, sibi nil nisi culpa remansit, Vnde superbus erat, modo si preconia querat. Eius honor sordet, laus culpat, gloria mordet: Hoc concernentes caueant qui sunt sapientes; Nam male viuentes Deus odit in orbe regentes: Est qui peccator non esse potest dominator, Ricardo teste finis probat hoc manifeste: Post sua demerita perijt sua pompa sopita Qualis erat vita cronica stabit ita. He was murdered at Pomfret Castle in the bloudie Tower, (so called from that time (vpon that bloudie act) to this day,) on Saint Valentines day, 1399. the first of Henry the fourth, when hee had raigned 22 yeares. That beautifull picture of a King sighing, crowned in a chaire of estate, at the vpper end of the Quire in this Church, is said to be of him, which wit¦nesseth how goodly a creature he was in outward lineaments: but I will conclude with these rimes out of my old Manuscript, the Addition to Ro∣bert of Glocester. This Rychard than regnyd sone Aftur his Belsire as was to done, Atte x yere of age crownyd was he, He was a man of grett beute.

Anne his first wife here entombed with him, Anne, Queene of England. was the daughter of Wen∣ceslaus, King of Bohemia, and Emperour of the Germanes; she died in An∣no 1394. the seuenth of Iune, at Sheene in Surrey: whom her husband so feruently loued, yea, vsque ad amentiam, euen to a kinde of madnesse, that for very griefe and anger, Stow.

Henry the fift King of Eng∣land. Henry the fift, sonne of Henry the fourth, King of England, and conque∣rour of France, died at Boyes de Viscenna, not farre from Paris, the last of August, 1422. hauing raigned 9 yeares, 5 moneths, and odde daies, from thence his body was conuaied to this Abbey; vpon whose Tombe, Kathe∣rine his wife, caused a royall picture to be layed, couered all ouer with siluer plate gilded, the head whereof was all of massie siluer: all which (at the suppression, when the battering hammers of destruction, (as Master Speed saith) did sound almost in euery Church) were sacrilegiously broken off, and by purloyning, transferred to farre prophaner vses, where at this day, the headlesse monument is to be seene, and these verses written vpon his Tombe. Dux Normanorum, verus Conquestor eorum, Heres Francorum; decessit et Hector eorum. Here Normans Duke, so stil'd by conquest iust, True heire of France; Great Hector, lies in dust. Gallorum mastix iacet hic Henricus in vrna Domat omnia virtus. So many vertues are attributed, by all writers, to this heroicall King Henry, the renowne of England, and glory of Wales, that where to begin, or when to make an end in his deserued praise, I know not: so I will leaue him, amongst the many Monarchs of this most famous Empire, none more complete, relating onely a few rimes, which in some sort doth particula∣rize his memorable exploits.

Queene of England, wife to the foresaid King Hen∣ry the fifth, in a chest or coffin with a loose couer to be seene and handled of any that will much desire it, and that by her owne appointment (as he that sheweth the Tombes will tell you by tradition) in regard of her diso∣bedience to her husband for being deliuered of her Sonne Henry the sixth at Windsore, the place which he forbad. But the truth is that she being first buried in our Ladies Chappell here in this Church, her corps were taken vp; when as Henry the seuenth laid the foundation of that admirable stru∣cture his Chappell royall, which haue euer since so remained, and neuer re∣buried. She was the daughter to Charles the sixth, king of France: she died at Bermondsey in Southwarke, the second of Ianuary, Ann. Dom. 1437. Her Epitaph. Hic Katherina iacet Francorum filia Regis, Heres & Regni, Carole Sexte, tui. Henrici quinti thalamo bis leta iugali Nam sic vir duplici clarus honore fuit: Iure suo Anglorum, Katherine iure triumphans Francorum obtinuit ius, decus imperij. Grata venit letis felix Regina Britannis Perque dies celebrant quatuor ore Deum. Edidit Henricum gemebunda puerpera Regem, Cuius in imperio Francus & Anglus erat. Non sibi sed Regno felici sidere natum; Sed Patri & Matri Religione parem. Post ex Owino Tiddero tertia proles, Nobilis Edmundus te Katherina beat: Septimus Henricus quo non prestantior alter, Filius Edmundi, gemma Britanna fuit. Felix ergo vxor, mater, ter filia felix, Ast Auia hec felix terque quater que fuit. Henry the se∣uenth king of England. Here lieth buried in one of the stateliest Monuments of Europe, both for the Chappell, and for the Sepulchre, the body of Henry the seuenth, King of England, the first begotten Sonne of Edmund, Earle of Richmond, by Margaret, daughter and heire to Iohn Duke of Somerset. This glorious rich Tombe is compassed about with verses, penned by that Poet Laureat (as he stiles himselfe) and Kings Orator, Iohn Skelton: I will take onely the shortest of his Epitaphs or Eulogiums, and most to the purpose, Septimus hic situs est Henricus, gloria Regum Cunctorum, ipsius qui tempestate fuerunt, Ingenio atque opibus gestarum & nomine rerum, Accessere quibus nature dona benigne: Frontis honos, facies augusta, heroica forma, Iunctaque ei suanis coniux perpulchra, pudica, Et secunda fuit: felices prole parentes, Henricum quibus octauum terra Anglia debes. He deceased at Richmond the 22. of Aprill, 1509. when hee had raigned 23. yeares, and somewhat more then seuen moneths, and liued fifty two yeares. Whosoeuer would know further of this king, let him reade his Hi∣story, wherein hee is delineated to the life, by the matchlesse and neuer enough admired penne of that famous, learned, and eloquent knight, Sir Francis Bacon, not long since deceased, Lord Verulam, and Viscount Saint Alban. Elizabeth the wife of king Hen. the se∣uenth. Here lieth entombed by her Husband Henry the seuenth, Elizabeth, the first childe legitimate and eldest daughter of king Edward the fourth; to whom she was married the eighteenth of Ianuary, 1488. whereby was vni∣ted the long contending Families of Lancaster and Yorke, and the Roses red and white ioyned into one, to the great ioy of the English Subiects. She was his wife eighteene yeares and twenty foure dayes, and died in child-bed in the Tower of London, the eleuenth of February, euen the day of her owne Natiuitie, the eighteenth of her Husbands raigne, and yeare of our Saluation, 1503. I haue an Epitaph of this good Queene (borne for Englands happinesse) which I transcribed out of a Manuscript in Sir Robert Cottons Library. Extinctum iacet hic genus a Plantagine ductum, Et Rosa purpureis candida nupta Rosis. Elisabet claris Anglorum Regibus orta, Regina & Patrij gloria rara soli. Edwardi soboles quarti, tibi septime coniux Henrice, heu populi cura benigna tui. Exemplex vite qua nec prestantior altra Moribus, ingenio, nec probitate fuit. Reginam Deus eterno dignetur honore Et Regem hic annos viuere Nestoreos. Margaret Coū∣tesse of Rich∣mond. Here lieth magnificently entombed, Margaret, Countesse of Richmond, and Darby, daughter and onely heire to Iohn Duke of Somerset, by Mar∣garet, daughter to the Lord Beauchampe of Powicke, first married to Ed∣mund the sonne of Owen Tedder, who begat Henry the seuenth, King of England, and afterwards to Thomas Stanley, Earle of Derby. Two Col∣ledges, namely, of Christ, and Saint Iohn Baptist, she erected for Students in Cambridge. Shee instituted also two Diuinitie Lectures, one at Cam∣bridge, and the other at Oxenford, who, hauing liued so long to see her Grandchilde, Henry the eight, crowned King, died the twelfth of Iuly, 1509. in the first yeare of his raigne. Here is a long Elegie made to her me∣morie by the foresaid Skelton, with this terrible curse to all those that shall tread, spoile, or take it away. Qui lacerat, violatue, rapit presens Epitoma, Hunc laceretque voret cerberus absque mora. Hanc tecum statuas Dominam precor O Sator orbis, Quo regnas rutilans Rex sine fine manens. Here lieth Margaret, Margaret the daughter of King Ed. 4. one of the daughters of King Edward the fourth, by Elizabeth his royall Queene and wife. She died an Infant, the eleuenth of December, 1472. Nobilitas & forma, decorque tenella inuentus Insimul hic ista mortis sunt condita cista. Vt genus, & nomen, sexum, tempus quoque mortis Noseas; cuncta tibi manifestat margo Sepulchri. Here lieth Elizabeth, Elizab. the daughter of king Hen. 7. the second daughter of King Henry the seuenth, by his louing consort and Queene, Elizabeth, who was borne the second day of Iuly, 1492. and died the 14. day of Nouember, 1495. Vpon her Tombe this Epitaph. Hic post sata iacet proles regalis in isto Sarcophago, inuenis, nobilis Elizabeth, Princeps illustris, Hen. Sept. filia Regis Qui bini regni florida sceptra tenet. Atropos hanc rapuit seuissima nuntia mortis, Sit super in celo vita perhennis ei. Here lieth interred, Anne Queene of England. without any Monument, Anne, the second daugh∣ter and coheire to Richard Nevil, the stout Earle of Warwicke, and Salis∣bury: who was first married to Edward Prince of Wales, the sonne and onely childe of king Henry the sixth, and after remarried to Richard Duke of Gloucester (who at the battell of Tewxbury had stabbed her husband into the heart with his dagger) afterwards by vsurpation king of England, surnamed Crook-backe. She died (not without suspition of being poysoned) the 16. of March, 1485. Here lieth entombed Edmund, Edmund Earle of Lancaster. the second sonne of King Henry the third, Earle of Lancaster, Leicester, and Darby, surnamed Crouch-backe, of his bowing in his backe, because he is neuer found (saith Vincent in his discouery of Brookes errours, title Lancaster) with any other addition, and indeed with no other Epithite then Gibbosus ; which signifieth crooked, crump-shouldred, or Camell-backed. But others say he was so denominated of wearing the signe of the Crosse (anciently called a Crouch) vpon his backe, which was vsually worne of such as vowed voyages to Ierusalem; as he had done. Further confirming their opinions from the name of Crou∣ched-Friers, that wore a Crosse vpon their garments. And Io. Harding spea∣king of him and his elder Brother Edward, afterwards king of England, and of their voyage to Ierusalem, hath these verses to the same effect. Harding c. 147. His brother Edward and he associate To Ierusalem, their voyage them avowed. Two semely Princes, together adioynate, In all the world was none them like alowed, So large and faire thei were, eche man he bowed. Edward aboue his menne was largely seen By his shulders more hie and made full clene. Edmond next hym the comeliest Prince aliue, Not croke backed, ne in no wyse disfigured. As some menne wrote, the right lyne to depriue, Through great falsehed made it to be scriptured: For cause it should alwaye bee refigured, And mentioned well, his yssue to prevaile Vnto the Crowne, by such a gouernaile. I cannot let passe, although I do somewhat digresse, the cunning sleights and deuises the Popes of Rome vsed in these times, to empouerish this king∣dome, and enrich their owne coffers. Mat. Paris. First they combine and confederate with the king to the vtter vndoing of all his loyall Subiects. And now Pope Alexander the fourth puts a tricke vpon the king himselfe (a Prince more pious then prudent) which exhausts his Treasure, Pageant of Popes. and leaues him for a laughing-stocke to all other Nations. This Pope, forsooth, inuested this Edmund his sonne, into the kingdomes of Sicilia and Apulia ( Conradus king thereof still liuing) by a ring; conditionally, that hee should sustaine the charges, and maintaine the warres that should happen thereupon. In which regard he suckt a masse of money from our credulous king Henry, who had so deeply swallowed the gudgeon that (his heart being ouer-ioy∣ed (saith Mathew Paris ) and raised euen to the height of exultation) hee swore by Saint Edward, to make a present voyage to Apulia, and take pos∣session of these dominions. But at length this counterfeit ring vpon the touch was discouered, and the good king knew himselfe deluded, his Ex¦chequer emptied, and this Titulary-king his sonne Edmund abused. Thus writes Mathew Paris, the Monke of S. Albans, who liued in those dayes; and deciphers the Legerdemaine, and iugling deuises of the Bishops of Rome to get money. This Edmund was Lord Steward of this kingdome, and Lieutenant of Gascoigne. Who being sent into Aquitaine with an armie, where he per∣formed notable seruice, died at Bayon, in the yeare 1296. And within two moneths after his death, his body was honourably transported into Eng∣land. Aueline Coun∣tesse of Lanca∣ster. Here lieth also entombed his first wife Aveline, daughter and heire of William de Fortibus, Earle of Albamarle, by whom he had no issue: who died the yeare 1269. Here lieth buried in a most magnificent Tombe, befitting the greatnesse of his birth, William de Va∣lence Earle of Penbroke. and the worthinesse of his Of-spring, William de valence, Earle of Penbroke, (so sirnamed of Valencia the place of his birth) sonne of Hugh le Brun, Earle of the Marches of Aquitaine, and halfe brother by the mothers side, Stow Annal. to King Henry the third. This William (saith Stow ) was slaine at Bayon by the French, in the yeare 1296. and with him, Edmund Earle of Lancaster, of whom I lastly spoke, if wee may beleeue these verses of Harding. But erle Edmond, the kynges brother dere, With twenty and sixe baners proud and stout, The fift daye of Iune was accompted clere, Harding ca. 56 Of Christ his date a thousand yere all out, Fourscore and sixteene, without doubt.

So was Sir William Valence erle of Penbroke than, Sir Iohn Richmond, and many other Baron: Sir Iohn Saynct Iohn, right a full manly manne: Thenglishe hoste felly ther was bore doune, By a bushement, laied by colucion, That brake on theim, sore fighting in the feld, Out of a wode, in whiche that day were beld. About the verge or side of his monument, these verses are inlayd with brasse. Anglia tota doles, moritur quia regia proles, Qua florere soles, quem continet infima moles, Guilielmus nomen insigne Valentia prebet, Celsum cognomen, nam tale dari sibi debet. Qui valuit validus, vincens virtute valore. E placuit placidus, sensus morumque vigore, Dapsilis, et habilis, immotus, prelia sectans, Vtilis, ac humilis, deuotus, premia spectans. Milleque trecentis cum quatuor inde retentis, In Maij mense, hunc mors proprio ferit ense. Quique legis hec repete quam sit via plena timore, Meque lege, te moriturum & inscius hore. O clemens christe celos intret precor iste, Nil videat triste, quia preculit omnibus hisce. Here lyeth entombed the body of Simon Langham, Simon Langham Archbishop of Canterbury. who was first a Monke of this Abbey, then Prior, and lastly Abbot, thence elected Bishop of London; from thence, before his consecration to London, aduanced to the Bishopricke of Ely, and from that place remoued to Canterbury: hee held diuers liuings in commendam, as the Archdeaconry and Treasure∣ship of Wels, with others. He was both Treasurer and Chancelour of En∣gland at seuerall times: It is scarce credible (saith Godwin now Bishop of Hereford in his catalogue de presulibus Anglie ) that is reported of his wonderfull bounty and liberality to this monastery. When hee was first made Abbot, he bestowed all that he had gathered together, being Monke and Prior, in paying the debt of the house, which was to the value of two thousand and two hundred markes; and discharged diuers other summes of money also, which particular Monkes did owe: he purchased good land which he gaue vnto them. When hee went out of England, hee left them bookes to the value of 830 pound, and Copes, Vestments, and other orna¦ments for the Church, worth 437. pound. At his death, he bequeathed vn∣to them, all his plate, prised at 2700. pound, and all his debts any where due, which amounted vnto 3954. pound, thirteene shillings and foure pence. He also sent vnto this Abbey, the summe of one thousand markes, to buy forty markes a yeare land, to encrease the portion of foure Monkes, that daily should say Masse for the soules of himselfe, and his Parents. The money that he bestowed vpon this Abbey one way or other, is reckoned by a Monke of the same, to be no lesse then 10800. pound; who thereupon compiled this Distich. Res es de Langham tua Simon sunt data quondam, Octingentena librarum millia dena. But men of eminent place and authoritie, cannot haue their due praise of all sorts of people; nay rather in requitall of their best actions, they shall reape nothing but opprobrious language: for vpon his translation from Ely to Canterbury, these two rayling, riming Hexameters were made to his disgrace. Letentur celi quia Simon transit ab Ely Cuius in aduentum flent in Kent millia centum. The Isle of Ely laught, when Simon from her went: But hundred thousands wept at's comming into Kent. He sate Archbishop of Canterbury onely two yeares, for being made Cardinall of Saint Sixtus by Pope Vrban the fift, hee left his Archbishop∣ricke, and went to Auinion, where shortly after he was made Bishop Car∣dinall of Preneste, by Gregory the eleuenth; where he liued in great estima∣tion about eight yeares, and died of a palsie, wherewith hee was suddenly taken, as he sate at dinner, Iuly 22. 1376. he was buried first in the Church of the Carthusians, which he himselfe had founded in the Citie of Auinion; but after three yeares, his bones (by his appointment while he liued) were taken vp and buried here a second time, vnder a goodly tombe of Alaba∣ster, vpon which this Epitaph was sometime engrauen.

Here lyeth Robert Waldby, Robert Waldby Archbishop of Yorke. who being a yong man, followed Edward the blacke Prince into France, where he continued long a Student, and pro∣fited so much, as no man in the Vniuersitie where he liued, might com∣pared with him for all kinde of learning: he was a good linguist, very well seene in Philosophie, both naturall and morall, in Physicke, and the canon Law; very eloquent, an excellent Preacher; and esteemed so profound a Diuine, as he was thought meete to be the professour of Diuinity, or Do∣ctor of the Chaire in the Vniuersitie of Tholouze. For these his good gifts hee was much fauoured of the blacke Prince, then of King Richard his sonne, who preferred him to the Bishopricke of the Isle of Man, from that preferment he was translated to the Archbishopricke of Dublin in Ireland, thence to Chichester, and lastly to the Archbishopricke of Yorke; where he sate not fully three yeares, but died the 29. of May, 1397. His Epitaph is quite worne or torne away from his monument, yet I found it in a Manu∣script, in Sir Robert Cottons Librarie.

Here vnder a marble stone in the Chappell royall, lyeth the body of Iohn Waltham, Lord Bishop of Salisbury, who had beene master of the Rolles, keeper of the priuie Seale, and Treasurer of England: in which of∣fice he continued till his death, which happened in the yeare 1395. hauing sate bishop 7 yeares, and executed the Treasurorship foure yeares. King Richard the second loued him entirely, and greatly bewailed his death. In token whereof hee commanded that hee should be buried here among the Kings: In vita R 2. hoc anno, saith Walshingham, viz. in the yeare 1395. obijt Iohannes de Waltham Episcopus Sarum & regni Thesaurarius qui tantum Regi com∣placuerit, vt etiam (multis licet murmurantibus) apud monasterium inter Reges meruit sepulturam.

Here lyeth another Bishop here buried (but not in so conspicuous and princely a place of the Church, as doth Waltham ) who was likewise by the Kings speciall commandement, here inhumed, for that he was accounted a very holy and vertuous man; namely, one Richard de Wendouer, Parson of Bromley, and Bishop of Rochester, who died in the yeare, 1250. and in the raigne of King Henry the third. Sir Humphrey Bourchier, Lord Cromwell. Here lieth interred, Sir Humfrey Bourchier, Lord Cromwell, the sonne of Henry Bourchier, Earle of Essex, by Isabell, daughter of Richard, Earle of Cambridge, and sister to Richard, Duke of Yorke; who in aide of his kinsman King Edward the fourth, was slaine at Barnet field vpon Easter day, 1471. Sir Humphrey Bourchier. And here lieth interred another Humfrey Bourchier, who was the sonne and heire of Iohn Bourchier, Lord Berners, who was also slaine at the same battaile; to whose memories this Epitaph yet remaines: Hic Pugil ecce iacens Bernet fera bella cupiscens, Certat vt Eacides, fit saucius vndique miles, Vt cecidit vulnus, Mars porrigit arma cruore, Sparsim tincta rubent, dolor en lachrimabilis hora, Lumine nempe cadit, quo christus morte resurgit.

Milling Bishop of He∣reford. Here lieth entombed in a slight monument in the wall, Thomas Mylling, sometime Abbot of this Monastery; from whence he was preferred to the Bishopricke of Hereford, by King Edward the fourth, vnder whom he was of the priuie Councell, and was Godfather to Prince Edward his eldest Sonne; He was a Monke of this house, being but a youth; and then went to Oxford, where he studied vntill hee proceeded Doctor of Diuinitie; in which time he attained good knowledge in the Greeke tongue; which in those dayes was geason, saith the reuerend Author of the Bishops Cata∣logue. Godwin. He died in the yeare 1493. Here in an obscure place of this Church, Hugolin Cham¦berlaine to S. Edward, king and Confessor. lieth the body of Hugoline, Chamberlaine to King Edward the Confessor, of whom this Storie is writ∣ten in the life of the said Edward. King Edward one afternoone lying in his bed with his curtaines round about him drawne, a poore pilfering Courtier came into his Chamber, where finding the Kings Casket open, which Hu∣golin had forgotten to shut, he tooke out so much money as hee could well carry, and went away; but insatiable desire brought him againe the second and third time for such a ready prey: vntill the King (who lay still all this while, and would not seeme to see) began to speake to him, and bade him speedily be packing, for he was well if he could see; for if Hugoline came and tooke him there, he were not onely like to loose all that he had gotten, but also to stretch an halter. The fellow was no sooner gone, but Hugoline came in, and finding the Casket open, and much money taken away, was greatly moued: But the king willed him not to be grieued. For (said he) he that hath it, hath more need of it then we haue. This Hugolin (saith M. Camden ) was buried in the old Chapter house of this Church. Remaines. Vpon whose Monument these sillie verses were engrauen. Qui ruis iniuste capit hic Hugoline locus te Laude pia clares quia martyribus nece clare . For learning, in this kings dayes, was so low ebbed in England, that be∣tweene Thames and Trent, there was scant one found which could vnder∣stand Latine. This passage of the aforesaid pilfery is delineated, and wrought in the Hangings about the Quire, with the Portraitures of the king, Hugolin, and the Theefe: vnder which are these verses. Ecce nimis parca furis manus exit ab archa; Celat opus furis, pietas, non regula iuris. Tolle quod habes et fuge.

Qui quidem Willelmus ob. 3. Iulij 1518. Here is an Epitaph cut in Brasse vpon a marble stone, now almost worne out, Rob. Haule. which was made to the memory of one Robert Haule Esquire, murder∣ed in this Church; the manner whereof our Chronicles doe thus briefely relate. In the battell of Nazers in Spaine, this Robert Haule, or Hawley, and Iohn Schakell Esquires, tooke the Earle of Dene prisoner, who deliuer∣ed vnto them his sonne and heire, as a pledge for assurance of performances. Not long after this, their Hostage was demanded by Iohn Duke of Lanca∣ster, in the Kings name, whom they denyed to deliuer, for which they were clapt in the Tower; from whence escaping, here they tooke Sanctu∣ary; to whom Sir Raph Ferreis, and Sir Alan Buxhull, with fifty armed men, were secretly sent to doe this mischiefe; who finding them at high Masse; first drew Schakell by a wile, out of the priuiledge of the Church, then offering to lay hands on Hawley ; he manfully resisting, with his short sword made them all flie off. But in the end he was slaine in the Chancell, commending himselfe, vit. R. 2 in his last words, to God, the reuenger of such iniu∣ries, and to the liberty of our holy mother the Church. With him was slaine a seruant of his, thrust into the backe with a Iauelin; and a Monke who intreated for him in respect of the holinesse of the place. This wicked act was perpetrated; the 11. of August, 1378. the second of Richard the second. These words following now onely remaining vpon his Monument.

Hic iacet Thomas Ruthal Episcopus Dunelmensis, & Regis Henrici septi∣mi Secretarius, qui obijt 1524. To this short Inscription, Godwin in his Catalogue addeth a long story of the life and death of this Bishop. Who was borne in Cicester (saith he) in the County of Glocester, and brought vp in Cambridge, where he pro∣ceeded Doctor of Law. He was preferred to the Bishopricke of Durham by King Henry the seuenth; after whose death hee was made one of the priuie Councell vnto the young King, Henry the eight, who esteemed great∣ly of him, for his wisedome and learning; and imployed him often in am∣bassages, and other businesses of importance. Amongst the rest it pleased the king one time, to require him to set downe his iudgement in writing concerning the estate of his kingdome in generall, and particularly to en∣forme him in certaine things by him specified. This discourse the Bishop writ very carefully, and caused it to be bound in Velime gilt, and otherwise adorned in the best manner. Now you shall vnderstand, that it chanced himselfe about the same time, to set downe a note of his owne priuate estate, which, in goods and ready money, amounted to the summe of one hundred thousand pounds. This account was written in a paper booke of the same fashion and binding that the other was, which was prouided for the king. Whereby it happened that the king sending Cardinall Wolsey for the other draught, which he had so long before required of him; the Bi∣shop mistaking, deliuered that which contained an estimate of his owne in∣finite Treasure. This the Cardinall soone espying, and willing to doe the Bishop a displeasure, deliuered it as he had receiued it vnto the King, shew∣ing withall, how the Bishop had very happily mistaken himselfe; for now (quoth he) you see where you may at any time command a great masse of money, if you need it. As soone as the Bishop vnderstood his errour, the conceit thereof touched him so neare, that within a short spa after hee died, at his house here in the Strand. His intention was to haue repaired the Church of Cicester, to haue built Bridges, as he had begun that ouer the Riuer of Tyne, and to haue done many other deeds of charitie, if hee had not beene preuented by death. Here lieth the body of Sir William Trussell knight, Sir William Trussell knight. and speaker of that Parliament, wherein Edward the second, king of England, resigned his Diad me, and all ensignes of Maiestie, to Edward his eldest Sonne: This Trussell (saith an ancient Author) was a Iudge, Tho. dela More. who could fit the house with quirks of Law, to colour so lawlesse and treasonable an act, as the deposing of a lawfull king. And thereupon was chosen in the behalfe of the whole Realme, to renounce all homage and obedience to the Lord Edward of Carnarvon, Lib. 7. cap. 43. his Soueraigne Lord and King. The forme of which renuncia∣tion was by him the said Trussell pronounced at Kenelworth Castle the 20. of Ianuary, 1326. in these disgracefull words which you may finde in Po∣lychronicon. I William Trussel, in the name of al men of the lond of Engelond, and of the Parliament Prolocutor; resigne to the Edward the homage that was made to the somtym, and from this tym forward now folowyng, I defye the, and priue the of al royal Powyr, and shal neuer be tendant to the as for Kyng aftyr this tyme. The time of this Trussels death I cannot learne. Here lieth interred before the Communion Table, Rich. de Ware Abbot. the body of Richard de Ware, or Warren, Abbot of this Monastery, and sometime Lord Trea∣surer of England. Who going to Rome for his consecration, brought from thence certaine workmen, and rich Porphery stones; whereof and by whom hee made that curious singular rare pauement before the high Altar: Francis Thinne. in Catal. Thes. Aug. in which are circulary written in letters of brasse these ten verses following, containing a discourse (as one saith) of the worlds continuance. Si Lector posita prudenter cuncta reuoluat Hic finem primi mobilis inveniet. Sepes trina, canes, & equos, homines, super addas Ceruos & coruos, aquilas, immania cete, Mundi quodque sequens pereuntis triplicat annos, Sphericus Archetypum globus hic monstrat Macrocosmum. Christi milleno bis centeno duodeno; Cum sexageno subductis quatuor anno, Tertius Henricus Rex, vrbs, Odoricus & Abbas Hos compegere Porphyreos lapides. With these stones and workmen, he did also frame the Shrine of Edward the Confessor, with these verses. Anno milleno Domini cum septuageno, Et bis centeno, cum completo quasi deno, Hoc opus est factum quod Petrus duxit in actum Romanus ciuis. Homo causam noscere si vis Rex fuit Henricus Sancti presentis amicus. This Abbot died the second day of December, 1283. after he had gouern∣ed this Monastery, three and twenty yeares and more. Vpon whose graue∣stone this briefe Epitaph is engrauen. Abbas Richardus de Wara qui requiescit, Hic portat lapides, quos hic portauit ab vrbe. Walter Wenlocke Abbot. After the death of Richard de Ware, Walter Wenlocke was chosen Abbot, and preferred to the honour of Lord Treasurer by King Edward the first. Hee was Abbot sixe and twenty yeares, The Abbots of this house were Barons of the Parliament. lacking sixe dayes: died vpon Christmas day at night, in the yeare 1307. And lieth buried vnder a mar∣ble stone: whereupon this Epitaph, to his high commendation, is inlayed in brasse. Abbas Walterus iacet hic sub marmore tectus, Non fuit austerus, sed mitis, famine rectus. Ric. de Barking Abbot. Here lieth Richard de Barking, Abbot of this Monastery, who was an especiall Councellour to King Henry the third, chiefe Baron of the Exche∣quer, and Treasurer of England. Who hauing beene Abbot 24. yeares, died the 23. day of Nouember, 1246. He was first buried in our Ladies Chap∣pell in a Tombe of marble, which was pulled downe by Frier Combe, a Sa∣crist of this house. Who layed a faire plaine marble stone ouer him, with this Epitaph thus inscribed. Richardus Barking Prior est post inclytus Abbas, Henrici Regis prudens fuit ille minister; Huius erat prima laus, Insula rebus opima, Altera laus eque Thorp, census, ocham, decimeque, Tertia Mortone castrum simili ratione Et Regis quarta de multis commoda charta. Clementis festo mundo migrauit ab isto. M. Domini C. bis: xl. sextoque sub anno. Cui detur venia parte pia virgo Maria. Gervaise de Bloys Abbot. Here in the Cloister vnder a flat stone of blacke marble, lie the remaines of Gervais de Bloys, so called of the place or Earledome which his father possest in France: who was Stephen Earle of Bloys and Champaigne; after∣wards king of England. He was his base sonne, begotten of one Dameta a gentlewoman of Normandy. He was brought into England by his father the fifth yeare of his raigne; and in the same yeare made Abbot of this place. In which gouernment he continued for the space of twenty yeares. He deceased the 26. of August, 1160. His Epitaph. De Regem genere Pater hic Gervasius ecce Monstrat de functus, mors rapit omne genus. Euen father Gervase borne of kings race; Loe is dead, thus death all sorts doth deface. Here lieth the body of Nicholas Litlington, Abbot of this house, who in the time of his gouernement, which was for the space of , yeares, built the Abbots hall, and the faire roome now called Ierusalem, the West and South part of the Cloister, and a Granary, now the Schollers long Bed∣chamber, with the Tower adioyning, as also the Water-Mill, and many other Edefices. He died Anno 1386. I found his Epitaph in a namelesse Ma∣nuscript, in that neuer enough admired Librarie of Sir Robert Cotton. Hacce Domo Ductor Nicholaus erat quoque structor Et sibi tunc sedem celo construxit & edem. M. semel, C ter erat annus, sex octuagenus Cum perit iste Abbas diuino flamine plenus. Quinta dies, fit ei requies, in fine Nouembris. Detur ei, pietate Dei, merces requici. Amen. Here lieth in the Cloister, one Vitalis, Vitalis Abbot. Abbot of this Couent, preferred thereunto by William the Conquerour; in the 16. of whose raigne, 1082. he died: vpon whose Tombe this Epitaph was engrauen, alluding to his name, like as for Laurence his successor. Qui nomen traxit a vita, morte vocante Abbas Vitalis transijt, hicque iacet. Here lieth the body of one Lawrence, Laurence the first m erd Abbot of West. Abbot of this Monastery, who ob∣tained of Alexander the third (that ambitious Bishop of Rome) to him∣selfe and his successors, the vse of the Miter, the Ring, and the Gloues; the Pastorall Staffe, before his time, being their onely comportment, as by the differing portraitures of the Abbots vpon their Tombestones may be easi∣ly discerned. He died, Anno 1176. to whose memory, this allusiue Epitaph was made. Clauditur hoc tumulo vir quondam clarus in orbe Quo preclarus erat hic locus, est et erit. Pro meritis vite dedit illi laurea nomen Detur ei vite laurea pro meritis. Here lieth Gislebert Crispine, Gislebert Cris∣pin Abbot. Abbot, who flourished in the raigne of King Henry the first, and died in the yeare of our redemption, 1114. His picture is vpon the graue stone, inlaid with brasse, with his Pastoral staffe onely, without Miter, Ring, or other ornament, with these verses. Hic Pater insignis, genus altum, virgo, senex que Gisleberte iaces, lux, via, duxque tuis. Mitis eras, iustus, prudens, fortis, moderatus, Doctus quadriuio, nec minus in triuio. Sic tamen ornatus nece sexta luce Decembris Spiramen celo, reddis & ossa solo. Here lieth interred, the body of Edmund Kirton, Edmund Kirton Abbot. Abbot of this Mona∣stery, Doctor of Diuinity, and a profound learned man: he adorned Saint Andrewes Chappell, wherein he lieth buried, with the armes of many of the English Nobility. These verses are inscribed vpon his monument. Pastor pacisicus, subiectis vir moderatus, Hac sub marmorea Petra requiescit humatus, Edmundus Kirton, hic quondam qui fuit Abbas, Bis denis annis cum binis connumerandus; Sacre Scripture doctor probus, immoprobatus, Illustri stirpe de Cobildic generatus: Coram Martino papa proposuit iste, Ob quod multiplices laudes habuit & honores▪ Qui obijt tertio die mensis Octobris An. Dom. M.cccc.lx.vi. Eleison Kyry curando morbida mundi. Iohn Islip, Abbot. Iohn Islip, Abbot of Westminster, a man of great authoritie and speciall trust with King Henry the seuenth, lieth here interred. He built the Deanes house as now it is, and repaired many other places in this Monasterie: in the windowes whereof (saith Camden ) he had a quadruple deuice for his single name; Remaines. for somewhere he set vp an eye with a slip of a tree: in another place, one slipping boughes in a tree; in other places, an I with the said slip; In bib Cot. and in some places, one slipping from a tree with the word, Islip. I cannot learne the time of his death by his Tombe, yet I finde in a Manu∣script, (wherein are diuers funerall collections, and other Inscriptions of this Abbey, which were gathered about the time of the dissolution) that he died the second of Ianuary, in the yeare 1510. the second of Henry the eight; and also that in the Chappell of Saint Erasmus, where he lieth buri∣ed, vpon the wall ouer his Tombe, was the picture of our Sauiour Christ, hanging on the Crosse, seeming to call and to giue good councell vnto man∣kind in these rimes. Aspice serue Dei sic me posuere Iudei. Aspice deuote quoniam sic pendeo pro te. Aspice mortalis pro te datur Hostia talis. Introitum vite reddo tibi, redde mihi te. In cruce sum prote, qui peccas desine pro me, Desine, do veniam, dic culpam, corrige vitam. Vnder this Crucifixe, was the picture of the Abbot, holding vp his hands, and praying thus in old Poetrie. En cruce qui pendis Islip miserere Iohannis Sanguine perfuso reparasti quem pretioso. Raph Selby. Here lieth entombed, the body of Raph Selby, descended from the anci∣ent family of the Selbies of Billesdun in the County of Northumberland, a Monke of this fraternitie, a learned Doctor in the ciuill and canon lawes, and one exceedingly beloued and fauoured of King Henry the fourth, and Henry the fift; in the eight yeare of whose raigne, hee departed this world, Anno 1420. as by this Epitaph appeareth. Ecce Radulphus ita Selby iacet hic Cenobita, Doctor per merita prepotens lege perita, Legibus ornatus, a regibus et veneratus, Ordo eiusque status per cum fit conciliatus. M. C quater, x bis. post partum virginis iste Michaelis festo tibi spirauit bone Christe. Not farre from this Selby, Io Windsore. lieth buried vnder a marble stone, the body of Iohn Windsore, one of the noble familie of the Windsores, sometime resi∣ding at Stanwell in this County; a great commander in the warres of Ire∣land, vnder Richard the second, and in the battaile of Shrewesbury, vnder King Henry the fourth: who died in the second yeare of King Henry the fift vpon Eester Eue, the seuenth of Aprill, 1414. as this Epitaph sheweth. Est bis septenus M. Christi C quater. annus, Vespera Paschalis dum septima lux fit Aprilis Transijt a mundo Io. Windsore nomine notus, Corde gemens mundo, confessus, crimine lotus: Fecerat heredem Gulielmus auunculus istum. Miles et Armigerum dignus de nomine dignum. Dum iuuenilis erat bello multos perimebat: Postea penituit & eorum vulnera fleuit. Recumbens obijt, hic nunc in carcere quiescit: Viuat in eternum Spiritus ante Deum. But now I will conclude the funerall Monuments of this Abbey, Geffrey Chaucer with the death and buriall of our most learned English Poet, Geffery Chaucer, whose life is written at large, by Thomas Speght, (who by old copies, refor∣med his workes) which the Reader may see a little before the beginning of his bookes. He departed out of this world, the 25. day of October, in the yeare of our Lord, 1400. after had liued 72. yeares. Thus writeth Leland: Chaucer liued till he was an old man, and found old age to be grieuous: and whilest he followed his causes at London, he died, and was buried at West∣minster. The old verses which were written on his graue at the first were these. Galfridus Chaucer vates et fama Poesis Materne, hac sacra sum tumulatus humo. Thomas Occleue or Okelefe, of the office of the priuie Seale, sometime Chaucers scholler; for the loue he bare to the said Geffray his master, cau∣sed his picture to be truely drawne in his booke De Regimine Principis ; de∣dicated to Henry the fift; according to which, that his picture drawn vpon his Monument, was made, as also the Monument it selfe, at the cost and charges of Nicholas Brigham gentleman, Anno 1555. who buried his daughter Rachell, a childe of foure yeares of age, neare to the Tombe of this old Poet, the 21. of Iune 1557. such was his loue to the Muses. But to re∣turne againe to Chaucers picture, to which these verses were added by the said Occleue. Although his life be queint, the resemblaunce Of him that hath in me so fresh liuelinesse, That to put other men in remembraunce Of his Person, I haue here the likenesse Doe make, to the end in soothfastnesse, That they that of him haue lost thought and minde, By this Peniture may againe him finde. The Inscriptions vpon his Tombe at this day are after this manner. Qui fuit Anglorum vates ter maximus olim Galfridus Chaucer conditur hoc tumulo Annum si quaeras Domini si tempora mortis Ecce notae subsunt quae tibi cuncta notant: 25 Octobris, 1400. Aerumnarum requies mors: N Brigham hos fecit musarum nomine sumptus▪ About the ledge of the Tombe, these verses were written. Si rogitas quis era , forsan te fama docebit Quod si Fama negat, mundi quia gloria transit Haec monumenta lege. Now it shall not be amisse to adde to these Epitaphs, the iudgements and reports of some learned men of this worthy and famous Poet: and first of all let vs heare his Scholler Occleue; Vir tam bonis liter s, quam generis prosapia clarus : these are his lines of him in his foresaid booke de regimine Principis. Alas my worthy maister honourable, This lands very treasure, and richesse, Death by thy death hath harme irreperable Vnto vs done: her vengeable duresse, Dispoiled hath this land of the sweetnesse Of Rhetorige: for vnto Tullius, Was neuer man so like among vs. Also who was heire in Philosophy To Aristotle, in our tongue but thee? The steppes of Virgill in Poese Thou suedst eken men know well inough: What combre world that thee my master slough Would I slaine were. Iohn Lidgate, a Monke of Burie, in his Prologue of Bocchas, of the fall of Princes by him translated, saith thus in his commendation. My Master Chaucer, with his fresh Comedies, Is dead alas chiefe Poet of Britaine, That whilome made full pitous Tragedies, The faule also of Princes he did complaine, As he that was of making soueraine; Whom all this Land should of right preferre Sith of our Language he was the load-sterre. That excellent and learned Scottish Poet, Gawyne Dowglas, Bishop of Dunkeld, in the Preface of Virgils Aeneados, turned into Scottish verse, doth thus speake of Chaucer. Venerable Chaucer, principall Poet without pere, Heuenly trumpet, orloge, and regulere, In eloquence, baulme, conduct, and dyall Milkie fountaine, cleare strand, and rose ryall. Of fresh endite through Albione Island brayed In his legend of noble Ladies sayed. Spenser in his Fairie Queene calleth his writings, The works of heauenly wit. Concluding his commendation in this manner. Dan Chaucer, Well of English, vndefiled, On Fames eternall beadrole worthy to be filed. Sir Philip Sidney likewise, and M. Camden speake much in the deserued praise of this worthy Poet, whom I leaue to his eternall rest. Vnder the Clocke in the Church, I haue read this Inscription. Dic mihi quid prodest horas numerare fugaces Cum cessant perdas quod numerare libet. This Church hath had great priuiledge of Sanctuarie within the precinct thereof (as Stow saith in his Suruay of London) to wit, the Church, Churchyard, Close, and all that which is still called the Sanctuarie. Which Priuiledge was first granted by Sebert king of the East Saxons, the first Founder thereof. Since encreased by Edgar King of the West Saxons, re∣newed and confirmed by King Edward the Confessor, as appeareth by this his Charter following. Edward by the grace of God, king of Englishmen: I make it to bee knowne to all generations of the world after me, that by especiall comman∣dement of our holy Father Pope Leo ; I haue renewed, and honoured the holy Church of the blessed Apostle, Saint Peter of Westminster; and I or∣der and establish for euer, that what person, of what condition or estate so∣euer he be, from whencesoeuer he come, or for what offence or cause it be, either for his refuge into the said holy place, he be assured of his life, liberty, and limbes. And ouer this I forbid (vnder the paine of euerlasting damna∣tion) that no Minister of mine, or of my Successours, intermeddle them with any the goods, lands, or possessions of the said persons taking the said San∣ctuary: for I haue taken their goods and liuelode into my speciall pro∣tection; and therefore I grant to euery each of them (in as much as my ter∣restriall power may suffice) all manner freedome of ioyous liberty, and whosoeuer presumes, or doth contrary to this my Grant: I will he lose his name, worship, dignitie and power. And that with the great traytor Iudas, that betrayed our Sauiour, he be in the euerlasting fire of hell. And I will, and ordaine, that this my grant endure as long, as there remaineth in Eng∣land, either loue, or dread of Christian name. King Edward the third built in the little Sanctuarie, a Clochard of stone and timber, and placed therein three bells, for the vse of Saint Stephens Chappell. About the biggest Bell was engrauen, or cast in the mettall, these words: King Edward made mee thirtie thousand weight and three: Take mee downe and wey mee, and more you shall fynd mee. But these Bells being to be taken downe, in the raigne of King Henry the eight, one writes vnderneath with a coale: But Henry the eight, will bait me of my weight. In the Steeple of the great Church in the Citie of Roane in Normandy is one great Bell with the like Inscription. Ie suis George de Ambios Qui trente cinque mille pois Mes lui qui me pesera Trente six mill me trouera. I am George of Ambois, Thirtie five thousand in pois: But he that shall weigh me, Thirtie six thousand shall find mee. One lately hauing taken view of the Sepulchres of so many Kings, No∣bles, and other eminent persons interred in this Abbey of Westminster, made these rimes following, which he called A Memento for Mortalitie. Mortalitie behold and feare, What a change of flesh is here? Thinke how many royall bones, Sleepe within this heape of stones, Hence remou'd from beds of ease, Daintie are, and what might please, Fretted roofes, and costlie showes, To a roofe that flats the nose: Which proclaimes all flesh is grasse, How the worlds faire Glories passe: That there is no trust in Health, In youth, in age, in Greatnesse, wealth: For if such could haue repriu'd, Those had beene immortall liu'd. Know from this the worlds a snare, How that greatnesse is but care, How all pleasures are but paine, And how short they do remaine: For here they lye had Realmes and Lands, That now want strength to stirre their hands; Where from their pulpits seel'd with dust They preach. In Greatnesse is no trust. Here's an Aker sowne indeed, With the richest royall seed, That the earth did ere sucke in, Since the first man dy'd for sin, Here the bones of birth haue cry'd, Though Gods they were, as men haue dy'd. Here are sands (ignoble things) Dropt from the ruin'd sides of Kings; With whom the poore mans earth being showne, The difference is not easily knowne. Her's a world of pompe and state, Forgotten, dead, disconsolate; Thinke then this Sithe that mowes downe kings, Exempts no meaner mortall things. Then bid the wanton Lady tread, Amid these mazes of the dead. And these truly vnderstood, More shall coole and quench the blood, Then her many sports a day, And her nightly wanton play. Bid her paint till day of doome, To this fauour she must come. Bid the Merchant gather wealth, The vsurer exact by stealth. The proud man beate it from his thought, Yet to this shape all must be brought. Chappell of our Lady in the Piew. Neare vnto the Chappell of Saint Stephen, was sometime a smaller Chappell, called our Lady of the Piew: but by whom first founded I can∣not finde. To this Lady great offerings were vsed to be made. Richard the second after the ouerthrow of Wat. Tilar (as I haue read) and other the Rebels, Ex Mss. in bib. Cot. in the fourth of his raigne, went to Westminster, and there giuing thankes to God for his victory, made his offering in this Chappell. By the negligence of a Scholler, forgetting to put forth the Lights of this Chap∣pell, the Image of our Lady, richly decked with Iewels, precious stones, Pearles, and Rings, more then any Ieweller (saith he) could iudge the price, was, with all the apparell and ornaments belonging thereunto, as also the Chappell it selfe, burnt to ashes. It was againe reedified by Antony Wid uile, Earle Riuers, Lord Scales, Vncle and Gouernour to the Prince of Wales, that should haue beene King Edward the fifth Who was vniustly be∣headed at Pomfret by the procurement of Richard Crook-backe, Duke of Glocester, then Lord Protectour, the 13. of Iune, 1483. Saint Margaret in Westminster. Adioyning on the North side of the Abbey, standeth Saint Margarets, the Parish Church of the Citie of Westminster, reedified for the most in the raigne of King Edward the fourth, especially the South Isle, from the piety of the Lady Marye Billing, and her second husband Sir Thomas Bil∣ling, chief Iustice of England in that Kings time. Whose Monument with that, to the memorie of her first husband William Cotton, Esquire, I haue here expressed. Here lieth Dame Mary Bylling, late wife to Sir Thomas Bylling, Knight, chiefe Iustice of England, and to William Coton, and Thomas Lacy: which Mary died the 14.day of March, in the yeare of our Lord God, 1499. Blessed Lady, &c. haue mercy, &c. Ant Mary gratia plena on me haue mercy on me haue mercy Ecce ancila dom Fiat secund: uerbu tuū The inheritance of this Lady, was the Lordship of Connington in Huntingtonshire. The seate once of Turketell, the Dane, Earle of the East Angles, who inuited ouer Swain King of Denmarke, to inuade this king∣dome. He exi 'd with most of his Nation, by Saint Edmond the Confessor. This his seate, with other his large possessions, were giuen by the same King to Walth o Earle of Northumberland and Huntington, to whom the first William gaue in marriage, the Lady Iudithe, his sisters daughter. This Lordship with the Earledome of Huntington, by the marriage of Mary that Earles daughter, to Dauid the sonne of the first Malcolme, King of Scots, and the holy Margaret his wife, Neece to Edward the King, Con∣fessor, Grandchilde to Edmond, surnamed Ironside, King of the English Saxons, and sister and heire to Edgar surnamed Ethelinge, by which mar∣riage, the Stemme Royall of the Saxons, became vnited into the bloud Roy∣all of the Scottish Kings; in whose male lyne, that Earldome, and this Lordship continued vntill Isabell, the daughter and heire of Dauid Earle of Huntington, and brother to Malcome, William, and Alexander, successiue Kings of that kingdome, brought them both by her marriage to Robert de Brus, into that family. She leauing the iust clayme of the Crowne of Scotland, to Robert her el∣dest sonne, whose sonne Robert the third, thereof obtained full possession: in right from whom, our sacred soueraigne King Charles is lineally to the same Crowne descended. And to her second sonne, Bernard de Brus, shee gaue this Lordship of Connington, with other large possessions in England, which after foure descents in that Stemme, was by marriage of Anne, the daughter and heire of Sir Iohn de Brus, to Sir Hugh Welengham, brought into that family, who after three descents by the marriage of Mary, the daughter and heire of the last of that surname, it came to William, second sonne of Sir Richard Cotton of Ridware, in the County of Stafford. From whom Sir Robert Cotton, Knight and Baronet, is lineally to that Lordship of Connyngton now descended. Hereby appeareth the much mistaking of many, who hold that the first King of the Norman race, cancelled with his sword, all claime of Inheri∣tances before his entrance, whereas in truth hee neither altered the funda∣mentall lawes or liberties of the Kingdome, or fortunes of any, but of those that sided with Harrold against him in his claime. For the words of his owne great Charter vnder seale, made the day of his Coronation, are; De∣uicto Harraldo Rege cum suis complicibus in ore gladij: ouer whom onely he declareth his conquest, but his Tytle was beneficio concessionis beati regis Edwardi cognati sui. And that he acknowledgeth as his right: And we can∣not passe ouer a dutifull and thankefull remembrance vnto God, who in his diuine iustice, after the course of little more then 500. yeares, hath restored againe in the sacred person of King Iames, of happy memory, the lyneall Royall race, and bloud of the Saxon Monarchie. In him vniting the Briton, Saxon, Norman, and Scottish Regall bloud, and by him restoring not one∣ly the name, but the ancient dignity of the Britaine Empire: fulfilling that old presage of Aquila, recorded many hundred yeares agoe. Regnabunt Britones Albani Gentis amici Antiquum nomen Insula tota feret Vt profert Aquila veteri de turre Loquta Cum Scotis Britones regna paterna regent Regnabunt pariter in prosperitate quieta Hostibus expulsis Iudicis vsque diem. Of which we haue a most happy assurance, by the now blessed issue of our most gratious and dread Soueraigne King Charles, who hath crowned thereby this state with an eternall peace.

This Iohn Skelton was that pleasant merry Poet (as his rimes yet extant doe testifie) who stiled himselfe Iohannes Skeltonus Orator regius, Io. Skelton Poet Laureat▪ Poeta laureatus. He flourished in the raignes of Henry the seuenth, and Henry the eight, by whom, in the Quire, Thomas Churchyard, that old Court-Poet lieth interred, and not in the Church-Porch, as these rimes following would approue. Come, Alecto, and lend me thy Torch, To fynde a Church yard in a Church porch. Pouertie and Poetrie, this Tombe doth enclose, Therefore Gentlemen, be merry in Prose. I finde in the collections of Master Camden, that there was some vnkinde passages betwixt this Poet laureat Skelton, and Lily our sole authenticke al∣lowed Gramarian; in so much, that Skelton carping against the verses of the said Lily, is (bitterly) by him thus answered. Lilij endecasillaba in Skeltonum Eius carmina calumniantem. Quid me Skeltone fronte sic aperta Carpis vipereo potens veneno? Quid versus trutina meos iniqua Libras? dicere vera num licebit? Doctrinae tibi dum parare famam, Et doctus fieri studes Poeta; Doctrinam nec habes, nec es Poeta. Almes-houses of Henry the 7. On the South side of the Gate-house, King Henry the 7. founded an Almes-house for thirteene poore men, one of them to be a Priest▪ aged fiue and forty yeares, a good Gramarian: the other 12 to be aged fiftie yeares, without wiues: euery Saturday the Priest to receiue of the Abbot or Prior, foure pence by the day, and each other, two pence halfe penny by the day for euer, for their sustenance; and euery yeare to each one, a Gowne and a hood ready made. And to three women that dressed their meat, and kept them in their sicknesse, each to haue euery Saturday sixteene pence, and e∣uery yeare a Gowne ready made. More to the thirteene poore men yeerely, fourescore quarters of Coales, and one thousand of good Fagots to their vse. In the Hall and Kitchin of their mansion, a discreet Monke to be ouer∣seer of them, and he to haue forty shillings by the yeare, &c. and hereun∣to was euery Abbot and Prior sworne. An Almes-house founded by Margaret, Countesse of Richmond. Westward from the Gate house, was an old Chappell of Saint Anne, ouer against the which, the Lady Margaret, Countesse of Richmond and Derby, and mother to King Henry the seuenth, erected an Almes-house for poore women, which was afterwards turned into lodgings for the Singing men of the Colledge. the place wherein this Chappell and Almes-house stood, was called the Eleemosinary or Almory, now corruptly the Ambry, for that the almes of the Abbey was there distributed to the poore. An Hospitall founded by Lady Anne Dacre. At the entry into Totehill field, was sometimes an old building, called Stourton house, which Giles, Lord Dacre of the South, purchased and built new, whose Lady and wife Anne, Sister to Thomas Lord Buckhurst, the first of that Familie, Earle of Dorset, left money to her Executours, to build an Hospitall there for twenty poore women, and so many children to bee brought vp vnder them. For whose maintenance she assigned Lands, to the value of one hundred pounds by the yeare. Almes-houses founded by Cornelius Van Dun. In the same field, vpon Saint Hermits hill, and neare vnto a Chappell of Saint Mary Magdelen, now wholly ruinated; Cornelius van Dun borne at Breda in Brabant, a Souldier with King Henry the eight at Turney, yeoman of the Guard, and Vsher to the said King Henry, Edward, Mary, and Eliza∣beth, Kings and Queenes of famous memory: built certaine Almes-houses for twenty poore widowes to dwell in rent free. He died in September, An. 1577. aged 94. yeares. The Hermitage, Hospitall, and Free-Schoole at Highgate-hill. In ancient times vpon the top of this hill was an Hermitage; one of the Hermites whereof, caused to bee made the Causway betweene Highgate and Islington, taking the grauell from the top of the hill, where now is a standing pond of water. One William Poole Yeoman of the Crowne, founded the Hospitall be∣low on the hill, in the raigne of King Edward the fourth. The free Schoole was built by Sir Roger Cholmundely, or Cholmeley, knight, Specul. Brit. sometime Lord chiefe Iustice of the Kings Bench; about the yeare 1564. the sixth of Queene Elizabeth. The Pencion of the Master is vncer∣taine (saith Norden ) there is no Vsher, and the Schoole is in the disposition of sixe Gouernours, or Ouerseers. Our Ladies Chappell of Muswell, or Mousewell hill. Here was, in ancient times, a Chappell bearing the name of our Lady of Muswell; in the place whereof Alderman Roe erected a faire house. The place taketh name of the Well, and of the Hill; for there is on the hill a spring of faire water, which is now within the compasse of Sir Nicholas Roes Cellar, in the said house. Here was sometime an Image of our Lady of Muswell, whereunto was a continuall resort, in the way of pilgrimage, growing (as it goes by tradition from father to the sonne) in regard of a great cure, which was performed by this water, vpon a king of Scots, who being strangely diseased, was (by some diuine intelligence) aduised to take the water of a Well in England, called Muswell; which, after long scruta∣tion and inquisition, this Well was found, and performed the cure. Abso∣lutely to deny the cure (saith Norden ) I dare not, for that the high God hath giuen vertue vnto waters, to heale infirmities, as may appeare by the cure of Naaman the Leper, 2. King. 1.14. Ioh. .2. by washing himselfe seuen times in Iordan; and by the Poole Bethesda, which healed the next that stepped thereinto, after the water was moued by the Angell. The Hermitage at Kilbourne. In the time of King Henry the first, Herbert Abbot of Westminster, by permission of Gilbert Bishop of London, and by consent of the Couent, granted to three Maides the Hermitage of Kilbourne, with all the land of that place; which Hermitage one Gorbone had builded long before. The Hospitall of S. Giles in the Fields for Leprous people. This Hospitall was founded by Queene Maude, wife to king Henry the first, Stow Suruay. in the yeare 1117. and was a Cell belonging to Burton Lazers of Ie∣rusalem, in the County of Leicester; as may appeare by a deed dated the 24. of Hen. 7. in these words. Thomas Norton knight, Master of Burton Lazers of Ierusalem in Eng∣land, and the brethren of the same place, keepers of the Hospitall of Saint Giles, without the Barres of the old Temple of London; haue sold to Gef∣frey Kent, Citizen, and Draper of London, a messuage or house with two Sollars aboue, edified in the Parish of Alhallowes Hony-Jane in West∣cheape, adioyning to the West part of a Tenement, called the Goate on the Hope, pertaining to the Drapers of London, for 31. l. S. Giles Bowle. At this Hospitall the prisoners, conueyed from the Citie of London to∣wards Teyborne, there to be executed, were presented with a great Bowle of Ale, thereof to drinke at their pleasure. The Hospitall of Saint Mary Bethlem, commonly called Bedlam. In the yeare 1247. Simon Fitzmary, one of the Sheriffes of London, founded this Hospitall for lame and indigent people, which afterwards was conuerted to that vse, which the Citie now makes of it, vpon this occasion. In the Parish of Saint Martins in the field, there was an house wherein sometime were distraught and Lunaticke people; of what antiquitie found∣ed, by whom, or what time suppressed, saith Stow, I haue not read. But it was said, that a King of England, not liking such a kinde of people to re∣maine so neare his Pallace, caused them to be remoued further off, to Beth∣lem without Bishopsgate of London, and to that Hospitall the said house by haring-crosse doth yet remaine. S. Peters Chappell within the Tower. Here lie interred the headlesse remaines of Iohn Fisher Doctor of Diui∣nitie, sometime Bishop of Rochester, brought vp a Scholler in Cambridge; Master of our Colledge (I meane Queenes Colledge in Cambridge) and Chancellour of that Vniuersitie. He was made Cardinall t t. S. Vitalis, the one and twentieth of May, which honour was to him parum vitalis, for the Cardinals hat and his head neuer met together; he being beheaded on the Tower-hill the 22. of Iune following, Ann. Dom. 1535. His bodie was first buried in Barking Church-yard, and afterwards vpon occasion as followeth, remoued to this place. He was a man in great estimation with Margaret Countesse of Rich∣mond, by whose exhortation shee built and endowed two Colledges in Cambridge, S. Iohns, and Christ Colledge; she made him one of her exe∣cutours. He liued likewise a long time in great fauour with her Grandchild King Henry the eight; euen vntill his marriage with Anne Bullein ; which he euer seemed to disallow. Whereupon he was suspected, and accused, to be of councell with Elizabeth Barton (commonly called the holy Maide of Kent) a Nunne of Saint Sepulchres in Canterbury, who by sundrie sug∣gestiue reuelations gaue out, that if the King proceeded in diuorce and se∣cond marriage, he should not raigne in his realme seuen moneths after, nor rest in Gods fauour the space of an houre. The story is frequent. Of which imputation he thus excused himselfe by his letters to the Kings Maiestie. To the Kings most gracious Highnes. Please it your graciouse Highenes benignely to heare this my most hum∣ble sute, The Bishop of Rochester let∣ter to S. amongst the letters In bib. Cotton. which I haue to make vnto your grace at this time, and to pardon me that I come not my selfe vnto your grace for the same. For in good faith I haue had so many periculouse diseases, oone after another, which began with me before Advent; and so by long continuance hath now brought my body into that weakenesse, that withouten perill of destruction of the same (which I darr saye your grace for your soueraigne goodnes wold not) I may not as yet take any traueyling vpon me. And soo I wrote to Maister Cromwell your moost trustie Councellor, Cromwell prin∣cipal Secre∣tary. beseeching him to obtayne your graciouse licence for me, to be absent from this Parliament, for that same cause, and he put me in comforthe soo to doo. Now thus it is (most graciouse soueraygne Lord) that in your most high Court of Parliament is put in a bill against me, concerning the Nunne of Canterbury, and intending my condempnation for not reuelyng of such wordes as she hadde vnto me towchyng your Highnes. Wherein I moost humblie beseech your grace, that without displeasor I maye shew vnto you, the consideration that moued me so to doo; which when your moost ex cellent wisdome hath deaplye considered, I trust assuredlie, that your cha∣ritable goodnes will not impute any blame to me therfore. A trowth it is, this Nunne was with me thries in commyng from Lon∣don by Rochester, as I wrote to Master Cromwell, and shewed vnto him the occasions of her commyng, and of my sendings vntyll hir againe. The first tyme she came vnto my house, vnsent for of my partye, and then she tolde me that she hadde bene with your grace, and that she hadde shew∣ed vnto you a reuelation which she hadde from Almighty God (your grace I hope will not be displeased with this my rehearsall thereof) She sayd that if your grace went forth with the purpose that ye intended, ye shold not be King of England seuen moneths after. I conceaued not by theis wordes, I take it vpon my soule, that any ma∣lice or euill was intended or ment vnto your highnes, by any mor all man, butt oonly that thei were the threattes of God, as she than did affirme. And though thei were feaned, that (as I wold be saued) was to me vn∣knowen. I neuer counsailled hir vnto that feanyng, not was privaye ther∣vnto, nor to any such purposes, as it is now sayd thei went aboute. Neuerthelesse if she hadde told me this Reuelation, and hadde not alsoo told me, that she hadde reported the same vnto your grace, I hadde bene verylie farre to blame, and worthy extreame punyshment, for not disclosing the same vnto your highenes, or else to some of your counsaill; But sithen she did assure me therewith, that she hadde playnelye told vnto your grace the same thynge, I thought doubtlesse that your grace wold haue suspected me that I had commyn to renewe hir tale agayne vnto yow, rather for the confermyng of myn opinion, than for any other cause. I beseech your highenes to take no displeasor with me for this that I will saye. It stykketh yet (moost graciouse Soueraygne) in my hart, to my no little heuynesse youre greeuous letters, and after that youre moost fearfull wordes, that your grace hadde vnto me for shewyng vnto yow my mynde and opinion in the same matter. Notwithstandyng that your highnesse hadde soo often and soo straytly commanded me to serch for the same be∣fore. And for this cause I was right loth to haue comyn vnto your grace agayne, with such a tale pertayning to that matter. Meny other considerations I hadde, but this was the very cause why that I came not vnto your grace. For in good faith, I dradde lest I shold therby haue prouoked your grace to farther displeasor agaynste me. My Lord of il. Warbam Canterbury also which was your great Counsaillor, told me that she hadde bene with your grace, and hadde shewed yow this same matter, and of hym (as I will answeare before God) I learned greatter thynges of her pretensed visions than she told me herselfe. And at that same tyme I shewede vnto hym, that she hadde bene with me, and told me as I haue written before. I trust now that your excellent wisdome and learnynge seeth there ys in me no defawte, for not reuelynge of hir wordes vnto your grace; whan she hir selfe did affirme vnto me that she hadde soo done, and my Lord of Can∣terbury that then was, confermed alsoo the same. Wherfore moost graciouse Soueraygne Lord, in my most humble wise I besech your highenes to dimisse me of this trouble, whereby I shall the more quietly serue God, and the more effectually pray for your grace; This, if there were a right great offence in me, shold be to your merite to pardon, but much rather taking the case as it is, I trust veryly yow will so doo. Now my body is mvch weakened with meny diseases and infirmities, and my soule is much inquieted by this trouble, so that my harte is more withdrawen from God, and fro the deuotion of prayer than I wold. And veryly I thinke that my lyve may not long continewe. Wherfore estsoones I besech your moost gracious highenes, that by your charytable goodnes I may be deliuered of this besynesse, and onely to prepare my soule to God, and to make itt ready agaynst the commyng of death, and no moore to come abroode in the world. This mooste graciouse Soueraigne Lord, I besech your highenes, by all the singular and excellent endewments of your most noble bodie and sowle, and for the loue of Christ Iesu, that soo dearly with his moost preciouse bloode redeamed yowr and myn. And duryng my lyue I shall not cease (as I am bownden) and yett now the more entearly to make my praier to God for the preseruation of your most roy∣all Maiestie. At Rochester, the xxvii. day of February. Your most humble Beadman and subiect, Io. Roffe. He writ likewise to the high Court of Parliament (then sitting) to the same effect: but before this businesse was fully finished, another came vpon him, In part Anno 2 Hen. 8. ca. 10. which was the oath of Supremacie; the refusing whereof, being ten∣dered, was adiudged high treason. This oath, or some part of it, he denies, whereupon he is committed to the Tower, from whence he thus writes to Cromwell. After my most humble commendations, Ex lit in Bib. Cotton. where as ye couet that I should write vnto the Kings Highnesse, in good faith, I dread mee that I cannot be soo circumspect in my writing, but that sum word shall escape me, wher∣with his grace shall be moued to sum further displeasure against me, wher∣of I wold be veray sory: For, as I will answer by for God, I wold not in any manner of poynte offend his grace, my duty saued vnto God, whom I must in euery thyng prefer. And for this consideration, I am full loth and full of feare to wryte vnto his highnesse in this matter. Neuerthelesse sythen I conceyue that it is your mynd that I shall soo doo, I will endeuor mee to the best that I can. But first here I must beseech yow gode master Secretary, to call to yowr remembrance, that at my last being befor yow, and the o∣ther Commissioners, for taking of the othe concerning the Kings most no∣ble succession, I was content to be sworne vnto that parcell concerning the succession. And there I did rehearse this reason, whiche I sade moued mee. I dowted not, but that the Prynce of eny Realme, with th' assent of his no¦bles and commons, myght appoynte for his succession Royall, such an or∣der as was seen vnto his wysdom most accordyng. And for this reason, I sade, that I was content to be sworne vnto that parte of the othe as concer∣nyng the succession. This is veray trowth, as God help my sowl at my most neede. Albeit I refused to swear to some other parcels, bycause that my conscience wold not serue me so to doo. Furthermor I byseche yow to be gode master vnto me in my necessitie, for I haue nether Shirt, nor Sute, nor yet other clothes that ar necessary for me to wear; but that bee ragged and torne to shamefully. Notwithstandyng I myghte easily suffer that, if thei wold keep my body warm. But my dyett allso, God knowes, how slen∣der itt is att meny tymes. And now in myn age, my stomake may not a∣way but with a few kynd of meats, which if I want, I decay forthwith, and fall into coffes and diseases of my body, and cannot keepe my self in health. Robert Fisher. And, as our Lord knoweth, I haue nothing left vnto me for to pro∣uyde any better, but as my Brother of his owne purse layeth out for me, to his great hynderance. Wherfore, gode Master Secretary, estsones I byseche yow to haue som pittie vpon me, and latt me haue such thyngs as are necessary for mee in myn age; and especially for my health. And also that itt may please yow by yowr high wysdom, to moue the Kings highnesse to take me vnto his gracious fauor againe, and to restor me vnto my liberty, out of this cold and painfull imprisonment; wherby ye shall bynd me to be yowr pore beads∣man for euer vnto almighty God, who euer haue yow in his protection and custody. Other twayne things I must also desyer vpon yow, first oon is, that itt may please yow that I may take som Preest within the Tower, by th' as∣signment of master Liuetenant, to hear my confession against this hooly tym. That other is, that I may borrow some bookes to stir my deuocion mor effectually theis hooly dayes, for the comfortte of my sowl. This I byseche yow to grant me of yowr charite. And thus our Lord send yow a mery Christenmas, and a comfortable to yowr hearts desyer. Att the Tower this xxii. day of December. Your poore Beadsman, Iohn Roffe. Thus he lay imprisoned, in great misery, hungrie, cold, and comfort∣lesse, as the prisoners dittie in Newgate runs, vntill the time of his arraign∣ment: during which time, as also before, being diuers times examined by the Lords of the priuie Councell, Ex Mss. in bib. Cot. as also examined and sworne in verbo Sa∣cer docij, by Thomas Bedyll, and Richard Layton, Clerkes of the Kings Councell, in the presence of Sir Edmond Walfingham, knight, Lieuetenant of the Tower, and others, to many Interrogatories, his answeres were euer agreeable in effect, with his letters. He was arraigned onely for denying of the Supremacie (howsoeuer he was before attainted by Parliament, of misprision of Treason, for the mat∣ter of the holy Maid of Kent) as by this his Indictment appeares, of which so much as is materiall.

Of this Indictment being found guilty, he had iudgement, whereupon execution presently followed; which the more was hastened, as also his arraignement, in regard of the rumour that a Cardinals hat was comming towards him from the Pope, Ex Mss. in bib.

He was of many, Vid. Bal. cent. 5. sore lamented, being a man of a very good life, and great learning, as his writings in diuers bookes did testifie.

Sir Tho∣mas More, Lord Chancellor of England, was likewise beheaded on the Tower hill, for the like deniall of the Kings Supremacie: he was first buri∣ed in this Chappell, and the body of his deare friend Fisher was remoued out of Barking Church-yard, and buried with him in the same graue: for agreeing so vnanimously in their opinions liuing, it was (be like) thought vnfitting to part them being dead; but how long they lay together in this their house of rest, I certainly know not: yet this is certaine, that Margaret, the wife of Master Roper, and daughter of the said Sir Thomas More, remo∣ted her fathers corps, not long after, to Chelsey; and whether she honou∣ued the Bishop by another remoue to the place of her fathers buriall, or not, I know not; yet she might, by all probabilitie. They were both accused to be of the adherents to Elizabeth Barton in her counterfeite holinesse, hypocrisie, and traiterous intents; but their in∣nocencie, and their often writing to the King and Cromwell, in their owne excuse, acquitted them of that imputation. In parl. Anno 26 Hen. 8. ca. 2. In the Act for the surety of the succession of the Crowne of England, an oath was deuised for the maintenance and defence of the said Act, which was to be taken by all the Kings subiects; this oath being tendered to these two, they were content to bee sworne to the maine point, but not to the preamble of the said Oath, which I haue touched before; of which, Cranmer Archbishop of Canterburie, thus deliuers his opinion by his letter to Secre∣tarie Cromwell : if I now digresse, I craue a fauourable construction. Ex lit. in Bib. Cotton. Right worshipfull Maister Cromwell, after most harty commendations, &c. I doubte not but you do right well remembre, that my Lord of Roche∣ster, and master More, were contented to bee sworne to the Actt of the Kings succession, but not to the preamble of the same: what was the cause of thair refusall thereof, I am vncertaine, and they wolde by no meanes ex∣presse the same. Neuerthelesse it must nedis be, either the diminution of the authoritie of the Bishop of Rome, or ells the reprobation of the Kings first pretensed matrimony. But if they doe obstinately persiste in thair opinions of the preamble, yet me semeth it scholde not be refused, if thay will be sworne to the veray acte of succession; so that thay will be sworne to mayn∣tene the same against all powers and Potentates. For hereby shall be a great occasion to satisfie the Princesse Dowager, and the Lady Mary, which doe thinke that they sholde dampne thair sowles, if thay sholde abandon and relinquish thair astats. And not only it sholde stop the mouthes of thaym, but also of th'emperour, and other tha r friends, if thay giue as much cre∣dence to my Lord of Rochester, and master More spekyng or doinge a∣gainst thaym, as they hitherto haue done and thought, that all other sholde haue done whan they spake and did with thaym. And peraduenture it sholde be a good quietation to many other within this Realme, if such men sholde say that the succession comprised within the said acte is good, and according to Gods lawes. For than I thinke there is not one within this Reaulme that wolde ones reclaime against it. And where as diuers persones either of a wilfulnesse, will not, or of an indurate and inuertible conscience can not, altre from thair opinions of the Kings first pretensed marriage, (wherein they haue ones said their minds, and percase haue a perswasion in their heads, that if they sholde now vary therfrome, their fame and e∣stimation were distained for euer) or else of the authoritie of the Busschope of Rome: yet if all the Reaulme with one accord wolde apprehend the said succession, in my iudgement it is a thing to be amplected and imbra∣ced, which thing, although I trust surely in God, that it shall bee brought to passe, yet hereunto might not a little auaile the consent and othes of theis two persones the Busshope of Rochester, and Maister More with thair adherents, or rather confederats: And if the Kings pleasure so were, thair sayd othes myght be suppressed, but whan and where his highnes might take some commoditie by the publyshinge of the same. Thus our Lord haue you euer in his conseruation. From my Maner at Croydon, the xvii day of Aprill. Your own assured euer, Thomas Cantuar. Here in this letter is to be seene the wisedome and policie of this prudent Archbishop, who could make such auaileable vse to the state, of the strong opinion, which most men conceiued, of the profound iudgement of these two persons. This Sir Thomas More was pregnant of wit, Scrip. B t. Cent. 5. De I ust. Ang¦ie Scriptoribus eloquent, wise, and learned, as by his bookes still extant doth appeare: and besides those mentioned by Bale, which we haue in print. During the time of his imprisonment, which was foureteene moneths (saith Pitseus ) he writ an historicall exposition of the Passion of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ, according to the foure Euangelists. Which I can hardly beleeue: for I finde, that when he was in prison, his bookes and all his papers were taken away from him. Where∣upon he shut vp his Chamber-windowes, saying, When the wares are gone, and the tooles taken away, we must shut vp shop. Thus would he lose his light before he would lose his iest; for that he would neuer lose nor leaue off, vpon the least occasion offered, vntill he had lost his head. He was twice married, In Epist. ad Vl∣dric. Huttenum de vita Mori. first, (saith Erasmus his intimate deare friend) Virginem daxit admodum puellam, claro genere natam ; He married a Maide very young, borne of a noble Familie, whom he tooke care to haue instru∣cted in all good literature, and to be expert in all sorts of Musicke; by her he had foure children; one Sonne named Iohn, and three daughters: Mar∣garet, Alice, or Aloysia, and Cicely. God (saith Leland that reuerend Antiquarie, that liued in his dayes) extraordinarily blessed these his children, and namely, his three daughters, to whom he had giuen an admirable dexteritie, in the science of Songs and Arts: which he noteth in this his learned Epigram. Desine facundas nimium laudare diserti Io. Lelandi Moriades, siue charitaea cor na. Natas Hortensi maxima Roma tui. Candida tres charites nam Mori cura politi Obscurant multis nomina vestra modis. Non illis studium Milesia vellera dextra Carpere, non facili ducere fila manu: Sed innat eloquij crebro monumenta latini Versare, & doctis pingere verba notis. Nec minus authores Graecos euoluere, Homerum Et quem dicendi gloria prima manet. Vt nec Aristotelis dicam quo pectore libros Scrutentur, sophiae mystica dona deae. Turpe viris posthac erit ignorare Mineruae Artes, grex adeo quas muliebris amet. His second wife was a widow, Camd. Re∣maines, in wise speeches. of whom he was wont to say, that she was, nec bella nec puella. Who as she was a good huswife, so was she not voide of the fault that often followeth that vertue, somewhat shrewd to her ser∣uants. Vpon a time Sir Thomas found fault with her continuall chiding, saying, If that nothing would reclaime her, yet the consideration of the time (for it was Lent) should restraine her. Tush, tush, my Lord (said she) looke here is one steppe to heauen-ward, shewing him a Friers girdle. I feare me, said he, this one steppe will not bring you vp a steppe higher. One day when she came from shrift, she said merrily to her husband; Be merry, Sir Thomas, for this day was I well shriuen, I thanke God, and pur∣pose now therefore to leaue off all my old shrewdnesse. Yea (quoth he) and to begin afresh. This man thus much giuen to a certaine pleasure in harmlesse mirth, fa∣cetious iests, and present wittie answers, was wonderfull zealous in Reli∣gion, and deuout: in so much that diuers times in his Chancellourship, he would put on a Surplise, and helpe the Priest to say and sing diuine Seruice; for which being reprehended by Thomas Duke of Norfolke, who told him that it was a dishonour to the King, that the Lord Chancellor of England should be a Parish Clerke. Hee thus answered, Now truly, my Lord, I thinke, and verily beleeue, that when the King shall heare of the care I haue both to serue his Master and mine, he will accept and take me for a faithfull Seruant. Which he might well say; for vpon his first comming to his ser∣uice, the King gaue him this godly lesson: First looke vnto God, and then after vnto me. Vpon which religious and Princely lesson, he grounds a rea∣son, and pleads a libertie, to vse his owne proper conscience in the Kings most weightie affaires; as you may perceiue by this part of a letter follow∣ing written to Cromwell. Ex lit. in bib. Cott. Right worshipfull, &c. it pleased the Kyngs highnes to send me in the companie of my Lord of London, now of Duresme, in embassiate aboute the Peace that at our being there was concluded at Cameray, betwene his highnes, and themperour, and the French Kyng. And after my comyng home, his highnes of his onely goodnes (as far my vnworthy I was thereto) made me (as you well knowe) his Chauncelor of this Realme: sone after which time, his grace moued me agayne yit-eftsonys to loke and considre his great matter, and well and indifferently to pondre such things as I should fynde therin. And if it so were, that therevpon it shoulde happen me to se such things as sholde persuade me to that parte; hee wolde gladly vse me among other of his Counsailors in that matter; & neuerthelesse gra∣cyousely declared vnto me, that he wolde in no wise that I sholde other thing do or say therin, than vpon that that I shold perceiue myn owne conscience shold serue me; and that I sholde fyrst loke vnto God, and after God vnto hym. Which moost gratiouse wordys was the fyrst lesson also that euer his grace gaue me at my fyrst comyng into his noble servyce. &c. This learned Chancellour with much labour and earnest suite to the King got leaue to leaue his office, before hee had continued therein fully three yeares. Vpon his last speech to his three daughters, and to the people present at his decollation: thus one writes. Ne lugete meo confusae funere natae: Nich. Grudius. Ipse ego mutari non mea fata velim. Truncum terra teget, si Rex non abnuet vrnam; Et mea iam terris nomina nota volant. Libera mens superos repetet, neque seruiet vnquam, In partem hanc quod agat nulla securis habet. Tu quoque spectator, tranquillum si cupis ae um Exigere, & letho fortior esse tuo. Qui tibi membra cadan nullo in discrimine pone; Quum sint naturae lege caduca suae. Another of his death, by way of Dialogue: thus. Hospes. Quis iacet hic truncus? cuius caput ense rescissum est? Quae natat in tetro sanguine canities: Ciuis. Hic est ille Thomas Morus, sic fata rependunt Tristia multa bonis, & bona multa malis. Hospes. Quae circumsistunt Diuae lugubre cadauer? Diua tenax veri, sancta Fides, Nemesis. Ciuis.

Thus much of Sir Thomas More in this place; you may know more of him hereafter, by his Epitaph in Chelsey Church. Cromwell, Tho. Cromwell Earle of Essex. surnamed the great, whom Wolsey first raised from the forge to eminent good fortunes; whom Henry the eight vsed as his instrument, to suppresse the Popes supremacie, and to dissolue religious Structures; whom he aduanced to the highest pitch of honour and authoritie: Ex Mss. in bib. Cotton. whom he cast downe suddenly, and bereft both of life and dignitie, lies here interred. He followed the same steps, to the same Stage, vpon the said Tower-hill, and acted there the same part, which his two friends, More, and Fisher, had done before him: and that within fiue yeares after. This Cromwell, this pillar of the State, was borne in Putney, a Village in Surrey, by Thames side, foure miles distant from London; hee was sonne to a Blacksmith, in his later dayes a Bruer. Whose mother, after his fathers decease, was remarried to a Shereman. Of whose birth a late writer thus sings. Putney the place made blessed by my birth, M. Drayton in the Legend of great Cromwell. Whose meanest cottage simply me did shrowd, To me as dearest of the English Earth; So of my bringing that poore village proud, Though in a time when neuer lesse the dearth Of happie wits, yet mine so well allow'd, That with the best she boldlie durst prefer Me, that my breath acknowledged from her. He was a man of an actiue and forward ripenesse of nature, ready and pregnant of wit, discreet, and well aduised in iudgement, eloquent of tongue, faithfull and diligent in seruice, of an incomparable memory, of a reaching politicke head, and of a noble and vndaunted spirit. Whose good parts being perceiued by Cardinal Wolsey, he took him straight into his ser∣uice, made him his Sollicitor, and emploied him in matters of great impor∣tance: after whose fall, hee was presently aduanced to the Kings seruice; wherein he so industriously and wisely demeaned himselfe, as that he was thought worthie by the said King, to haue the ordering of all weightie af∣faires. Whereupon at seuerall times, he heaped these seuerall offices and ho∣nours vpon him; he made him Master of his Iewell-house; Baron Cromwell of Okeham, principall Secretarie, Master of the Rolles, Chancellour of the Exchequer, Keeper of the priuie Seale, Iustice of the Forrests and Chases from the Riuer of Trent Northward, great Chamberlaine of England, Earle of Essex, Knight of the Garter, Vicegerent, or Vicar generall. Of which my fore remembred friend thus writes. M. Drayton. For first from knighthood rising in degree, The Office of the Iewell-house my lot, After the Rolles, he frankly gaue to me, From whence a priuie Counsellor I got, Then of the Garter; and then Earle to be Of Essex: yet sufficient these were not: But to the great Vicegerencie I grew, Being a title as supreme as new. Thus Fortune raised him a short time for a sudden fall; For vpon the eighteenth day of Aprill, 1540. hee was inuested with the honour of the Earledome of Essex, and high Chamberlainship of England; vpon which day the King also made his sonne Gregory Lord Cromwell. Vpon the ninth of Iuly, next and immediately following (being enuied of many for his ho∣nour and authoritie) he was suddenly arrested in the Councell-chamber, and committed to the Tower, vpon the nineteenth of the said moneth, he was attainted by Parliament, of heresie and high Treason; and vpon the 28. of the said moneth, hee was beheaded on the Tower-hill. More succinctly, thus, his precipitate downfall is versified. M. Drayton. The Councell-chamber place of my arrest, Where chiefe I was, when greatest was the store: And had my speeches noted of the best, That did them as high Oracles adore. A Parliament was lastly my Enquest, That was my selfe a Parliament before. The Tower hill Scaffold, last I did ascend, Thus the great'st man of England made his end. And such bloudie ends most men haue, who are busie managers of the greatest matters. He was condemned to death, Some say, no such Act was deuised by him to cause his owne death. Speed. chap. 21. and yet neuer came to his answere, by an act (as it is said) which he himselfe caused to be made; of which my fore∣remembred Author M. Drayton. Those lawes I made my selfe alone to please, To giue me power more freely to my will, Euen to my equals hurtfull sundrie waies, (Forced to things that most doe say were ill) Vpon me now as violently seize, By which I lastly perish by my skill, On mine owne necke returning (as my due) That heauie yoke wherein by me they drew. Thus whilst we striue, too suddenly to rise, By flatt'ring Princes with a seruile tong; And being soothers to their tirannies, Worke our much woes, by what doth many wrong. And vnto others tending iniuries, Vnto our selues it hapning oft among. In our owne snares vnluckily are caught, Whilst our attempts fall instantly to naught. Many lamented this great mans fall, but more reioiced, especially such as had beene religious men, or fauoured religious persons; of the Clergie he was much hated, for that he was an enemy to Poperie, and could neuer indure the snuffing pride of the Prelates. Thankefull hee was, and liberall, neuer forgetting former benefits, as appeares by his requitall of the kinde∣nesse he had receiued from Friscolald the Italian Merchant; Iohn Fox. M. Drayton. carefull he was of his seruants, for whom hee had prouided a competencie of liuing, not∣withstanding his sodaine fall: faithfull and forward hee was to doe his friends good, and amongst them More and Fisher, if we may beleeue their owne letters, of which some part. Right worshipfull, Sir Tho. Moore, to Master Cromwell, Ex lit. in bib. Cot▪ after my moost hartie commendations, it may please you to vnderstand that I haue perceiued by the relation of my Sonne Roo∣per, (for which I beseche almightie God reward yow) your moost cheri∣table labour taken for me toward the Kings graciouse highnesse, in the pro∣curing at his moost graciouse hand, the reliefe and comfort of this wofull heuinesse, in which myn harte standeth, &c. concluding in these words. And thus good Master Cromwell, I make an end of my long troublouse processe, beseching the blessed Trinitie, for the great goodnesse ye shew me, and the great cumfort ye do me both bodelie and ghostlie to prospere yow, and in heauen to reward yow. At Chelcith the v. day of March, by Your deepely bounden, Tho. More, Knight. Bishop Fisher acknowledgeth the like kindenesse from him in ma∣ny of his letters: And howsoeuer these two famous schollers, after some hard imprisonment, lost both their liues; yet was hee not wanting by his best endeuours, and his all-potencie with the King, to haue saued their neckes from the stroke of the Axe, which we may verily beleeue, when we consider that King Henries command was a Law; of which Cromwell had a triall, being conuicted and executed without triall. Seruices done by the foresaid Cromwell vnto King Henry the eight, within a few yeares after his first comming into the fauour and seruice of the said King, copied out of the Originall, written with his owne hand, and now remaining in the Treasury of the Exchequer. Imprimis, the King purchased Hampton Court. Item, the King purchased the Manore of Moye. Item, the King purchased Saint Iameses in the fields, and all the grounds whereof the new Parke of Westminster is made. Item, his highnesse hath purchased all the old Tenements in Westmin∣stre, whereas now is builded the new garden, the Tenesplaies, and Cock∣fights. Item, his highnesse hath purchased the Manore of Pisowe, of the Lord Scroope. Item, his highnesse hath purchased the Manore of Weston Baldock. Item, his highnesse hath purchased the Manore and Parke of Copped∣hall. Item, his Maiestie hath purchased lands to a great value, of the Earle of Northumberland. Item, his Maiestie hath purchased certaine lands of Thomas Robarts, the Auditore, lying besides Waltham. Item, his Highnesse hath purchased of the Lord Audley, the Mannor of Lanamuerye and Keymes in Walles. Item, his Highnesse hath purchased the Mannor, and certaine other lands in Chombham, whereof a Parke is made, of the Abbot of Chensey. Item, his Highnesse hath purchased the Mannor of Alderbrooke in the Forrest of Waltham, of one Monoke. Item, the King hath purchased the Mannor of Edmonton, in the Coun∣try of Middlesex. Item, his Highnesse hath repaired the Tower of London, to his great charges. Item, his Highnesse hath newly made the Ship, called the Mary Rose, the Peter, Pomgarnete, the Lyon, the Katherine Galley, the Barke, the Mini∣one, the Sweepestake. Item, his Highnesse hath purchased the Mannor of Cogeshall and Estor∣ford, of master Southwell. Item, his highnesse hath purchased the woods besides Portesmouthe in Hampshire, sufficient for the new making of Henry-grace a dieu, and the great Galley.

Item, his Highnesse hath made a great deale of new Ordenance of brasse here in England. Item, his Highnesse hath newly edified a great part of the walls of Calles. Item, his Highnesse hath made a great quantitie of new Ordenance within the Towne of Calles. Item, his Highnesse hath most costly warres in Scotland. Item, he hath most costly warres in Ireland. Item, he hath been at a most costly charge for the Coronation of Queen Anne. Item, his Highnesse hath maintained the great and sumptuous house of the Lady Katherine Dowager. Besides these, he did many other seruices for the King his master; but I will insist onely vpon two, by which he greatly enriched his Coffers. The one was vpon the Coronation of Queene Anne Bullen, against which solemnitie, the King sent writings to all Sheriffes, to certifie the names of men of fortie pounds lands, to receiue the order of Knighthood, or else to make fine for the same. The asseasement of which (saith my Author) was appointed to Thomas Cromwell then master of the Kings Iewell-house, who so vsed the matter, that a great summe of money was leuied to the Kings vse by those fines. The other was his paines and pollicie in the suppressing of Religious Foundations. This great man gaue great reliefe to the poore; Stow. Annal. two hundred poore peo∣ple were serued at his gates twise euery day; with bread, meat, and drinke sufficient. He had 220. men and aboue in checke roll; he gaue liueries garded with veluet to his Getlemen; and garded with the same cloth to his Yeomen, saith Iohn Stow in the Suruay of London, in the chapter of orders and cu∣stomes. Queene Anne Bullein. Within the Quire of this Chappell, lieth buried the body of Anne Bol∣lein, Marchionesse of Penbroke, eldest daughter and coheire of Thomas Bollein, Viscount Rochford, Earle of Wiltshire and Ormond, second wife to King Henry the eight, to whom shee bare into the world, that most re∣nowned Princesse, Elizabeth, our late Queene, who proued not onely the mirrour of the world, for vertue, wisedome, piety, and iustice, but also a patterne for gouernment to all the Princes in christendome. Speed cap. 21. Another man∣childe she bore also vnto the said King, though without life, vpon the 29. day of Ianuary, and the 27. yeare of his raigne, to the no little griefe of his mother, some dislike of the King, as the sequele of her accusation and death did shortly confirme: for vpon the 19. day of May next following, vpon the greene within the Tower, her head was cut off by the sword, and by the hands of the Hangman of Caleis; when shee had beene King Henries wife three yeares, three moneths, and twenty fiue daies. The bloud was scarse wipt off the blade, nor shee in her graue, (an argument that her life was sought after vpon fal e ) before ano∣ther Lady was possest of her bed; for, on the her beheading, the King her husband was married to that Princesse Iane, the the daughter of Iohn Seymor Knight, and sister to Lord Edward Seymour, Earle of Hertford, and Duke of Somerset. Here lieth buried in the said Chappell, the body of George Bollein, Lord Rochford, George Bullein, Lord Roch∣ford. brother to the beheaded Queene, who (together with Henry Norrice, Marke Smeton, William Brereton, and Francis Weston, all of the Kings priuie Chamber) was beheaded on the Tower h ll, two daies be∣fore the death of his Sister, about matters concerning the said Queene: none of them all confessing the act whereupon they suffered death; onely Sme∣ton, contrarie to his conscience (saith one) confest some thing, Speed cap. 21. in hope of life and preferment, which condemned both himselfe and the rest, of which, Sleidan. com. l. 10. thus Cromwell writ to the King. Many things haue beene obiected, but nothing confessed, onely some circumstances haue beene acknowledged by Marke Smeton. This hee writ after the prisoners had beene throughly examined in the Tower. This Smeton, Brierton, Norrice, and Weston, lie buried here in the Chappell-yard. Queene Kathe∣rine Howard. Here, and neere to the reliques of the said Anne Bollein, lieth interred the body of Katherine, the fift wife of King Henry the eight, the daughter of Edmond, and Neece vnto Thomas Howard his brother, Duke of Nor∣folke; who hauing continued his wife but the space of one yeare, sixe mo∣neths, and foure daies, was attainted by Parliament, and beheaded here in the Tower, vpon the 13. of February, 1541. It is verily beleeued, and many strong reasons are giuen, both by En∣glish and forraine writers, to confirme that beliefe; that neither this Queene Katherine, nor Queene Anne, were any way guiltie of the breach of ma∣trimony, whereof they were accused; but that King Henry, vnconstant and variable in his affections, and as vnstayed in religious resolutions, did cut them off vpon false suggestions, soone wearie of the old, and euer ay∣ming at new Espousals. Betweene these two Queenes, Ed. and Iohn Dukes of So∣merset and Northumber∣land before the high Altar, lie buried two Dukes, to wit, the Duke of Somerset, Edward Seymour, and the Duke of Northumberland, Iohn Dudley. Of whom hereafter. Here lieth Henry Southworth, Hen. South∣worth. borne at Halton Castle, in the Parish of Runkorne in Cheshire, Yeoman of the Crowne, and of the Guard, to king Henry the seuenth, and Henry the eight, Yeoman Bawier, and Surveiour in the Tower of London for the space of 33. yeares.

There are some other Inscriptions in this Chappell, but they are of late times. Burials of the dead in the fields, neare to the Citie of London. These burials in the fields might better haue beene spoken of, in my pre∣fixed discourse, where I write of the strange custome of interring, and pre∣seruing of the bodies of the dead. But being forgotten there, it will not be amisse (I hope) that they may be remembred here. In the fields on the North-East and East side of the suburbs, In Mi lesex. whiles I was writing these matters (saith Camden ) there were gotten out of the ground many vrnes, funerall vessels, little Images, and earthen pots, wherein were small peeces of money coined by Claudius, Nero, Vespasian, &c. Glasse vi∣als also, and sundrie small earthen vessels, wherein some liquid substance remained, which I would thinke to be either of that sacred oblation of wine and milke, which the ancient Romanes vsed when they burnt the dead, or else those odoriferous liquors that Statius mentioneth. Pharijque liquores Arsuram lavere Comam. And liquid baulmes from Egypt-land that came Did wash his haire that ready was for flame. This place the Romanes appointed to burne and burie dead bodies, who according to the law of the twelue tables carried coarses out of their Cities, and interred them by the high-wayes side, to put passengers in minde that they are, as those were, subiect to mortalitie. Stow speakes more fully of these, Suruay in Bi∣shopsgateward. and other kindes of funerall Monu∣ments, found here in the fields. About the yeare 1576. saith hee, Lolesworth-field, now called Spittle∣field, was broken vp for clay to make Bricke. In the digging whereof, many earthen pots, called Vrnae, were found full of Ashes, and burnt bones of men, to wit, of the Romanes, that inhabited here. For it was the custome of the Romanes, to burne their dead, to put their Ashes in an Vrne, and then burie the same with certaine ceremonies, in some field appointed for that purpose, neare vnto their Citie. Euery of these pots had in them (with the ashes of the dead) one peece of Copper-money, with the inscription of the Emperour then raigning; some of them were of Claudius, some of Vespasian, some of Nero, some of Antonius Pius, of Traiane, and others. Besides those vrnes, many other pots were found in the same place, made of a white earth, with long neckes and handles, like to our stone Iugs: these were emptie, but seemed to be buried full of some liquid matter, long since consumed and soaked through. For there were found diuers vials, and other fashioned Glasses, some most cun∣ningly wrought, such as I haue not seene the like, and some of Christall, all which had water in them, nothing differing in clearnesse, taste, or sauour, from common spring water, whatsoeuer it was at the first. Some of these Glasses had oyle in them very thicke, and earthy in sauour. Some were sup∣posed to haue Balme in them, but had lost the vertue: Many of these pots and Glasses were broken in cutting of the clay, so that few were taken vp whole. There were also found diuers Dishes and Cups, of a fine re de coloured earth, which shewed outwardly such a shining smoothnesse, as if they had beene of currall. Those had (in the bottomes) Romane letters printed; There were also Lampes of white earth and red, artificially wrought with diuers Antiques; about them, some three or foure Images, made of white earth, about a spanne long each of them. One, I remember, was of Pallas, the rest I haue forgotten. I my selfe haue reserued (amongst diuers of those Antiquities there) one vrne, with the ashes and bones, and one pot of white earth very small, not exceeding the quantitie of a wine pint, made in shape of a Hare squatted vpon her legges, and betweene her eares is the mouth of the pot. There hath also beene found (in the same field) diuers coffins of stone, containing the bones of men: these I suppose to be the burials of some spe∣ciall persons, in time of the Brittaines, or Saxons. Moreouer, there were also found the sculls and bones of men without coffins, or rather whose coffines (being of great timber) were consumed. Diuers great Nailes of Iron were there found, such as are vsed in the wheeles of shod carts, being each of them as bigge as a mans finger, and a quarter of a yard, the heads two inches ouer. Those Nailes were more wondred at then the rest of the things there found; and many opinions of men were there vttered of them; namely that the men there buried, were murthered by driuing those Nailes into their heads, a thing vnlikely: for a smaller Naile would more aptly serue to so bad a purpose; and a more secret place would lightly be imployed for such buriall. But to set downe what I obserued concerning this matter, I there beheld the bones of a man lying (as I noted) the head North, the feet South, and round about him (as thwart his head, along both his sides, and thwart his feet) such Nailes were found. Wherefore I coniectured them to be Nailes of his coffin. Which had beene a trough, cut out of some great tree, and the same couered with a planke of a great thicknesse, fastened with such Nailes, and therefore I caused some of the Nailes to be reached vp to found vnder the broad heads of them, the old wood, eane turned into earth▪ but still retaining both the graine and proper colour. Of these Nailes (with the wood vnder the head thereof) I reserued one, as also the -bone of the man, the teeth being great, sound, and fixed, which (amongst many other Monuments there found) I haue yet to shew: but the nayle lying dry, is by scaling greatly wasted. And thus much of ancient Funerall Mo∣numents in the fields. Certaine Burials of British Kings in and about London, the places of their interments vncertaine. And first to begin with Guentoline, the sonne of Gurgunstus, King of Britaine, who flourished about the yeare of the world, 3614. Who was a wise Prince, graue in counsell, and sober in behauiour, and studied, with great care and diligence, to reforme anew, and to adorne with iustice, lawes, and good orders, the British commonwealth; by other Kings not so framed as stood with the greatnesse thereof. But as he was busie in hand herewith, death tooke him away from these worldly employments, when hee had raigned 27. yeares. He had a wife named Martia Proba, a woman of perfect beautie, and wisedome incomparable, as by her prudent gouernment, and equall admi∣nistration of iustice, after her husbands decease, during her sonnes minori∣tie, it most manifestly appeared. She was a woman expert and skilfull in diuers sciences, but chiefely, be∣ing admitted to the gouernment of the Realme, she studied to preserue the common wealth in good, quiet, and decent order; and therefore deuised, established, and writ a booke in the British tongue of profitable and conue∣nient Lawes, the which after her name were called Martian Lawes. These Lawes afterwards Gildas Cambrius, the Historicall Welch Poet, transla∣ted into Latine: and a long time after him, Alured, King of the West Saxons, holding these lawes necessarie for the preseruation of the common wealth, put them into English Saxon speech, and then they were called af∣ter that translation, Marchenclagh, that is to meane, the Lawes of Martia ; adding thereunto a Booke of his owne writing of the Lawes of England, which he called, A certaine Breuiarie extracted out of diuers Lawes of the Troians, Grecians, Britaines, Saxons, and Danes. She flourished before the birth of our Lord and Sauiour, 348. yeares, or thereabouts. Her sonnes name was Sicilius, Sicilius king of Britaine. who vpon the death of his Father was but young: for I reade that Martia his mother, deliuered vp the gouern∣ment of the kingdome to her sonne when he came to lawfull age, which she had right politiquely guided, and highly for her perpetuall renowne and commendation, the space of fourteene yeares. He died when hee had raigned seuen yeares, some say fifteene yeares. Of Bladud, king of Britaine, the sonne of Lud hurdibras, many incredible passages are deliuered by our old British writers, and followed by sundrie Authors of succeeding ages, which say, that he was so well seene in the Sci∣ences of Astronomie and Necromancie, that thereby hee made the hote springs in the Citie of Bathe: that he built the Citie of Bathe: that he went to Athens and brought with him foure Philosophers, and by them insti∣tuted an Vniuersitie at Stanford in Lincolnshire. And further to shew his Art and cunning, that he tooke vpon him to flie into the aire; and that hee broke his necke by a fall from the Temple of Apollo in Troynouant, before the incarnation of Christ 852. yeares, in the twentieth yeare of his raigne. Geffrey of Monmouth, and Mathew of Westminster would approue as much as here is spoken of him; Song 3. And learned Selden in his Illustrations vp∣on Draytons Polyolbion, sets downe an ancient fragment of rimes, wherein these strange things of him are exprest. Cap 25. But of him here in this place, will it please you take a peece out of Harding, and you shall haue more hereafter. Bladud his sonne after him did succede, And reigned after then full xx. yere, Cair Bladud so that now is Bath I rede, He made anone the hote bathes there infere When at Athens he had studied clere He brought with hym iiii Philosophers wise Schole to hold in Brytaine and exercyse. Stanforde he made that Stanforde hight this daye In which he made an Vniuersitee, His Philosophers, as Merlin doth saye Had scholers fele of grete habilitee, Studyng euer alwaye in vnitee, In all the seuen liberall science, For to purchase wysedome and sapience▪ In Cair Bladim he made a temple right And sette a Flamyne therein to gouerne, And afterward a a man decked in fe hers. Fetherham he dight, To flye with winges, as he could best discerne, Aboue the aire nothyng him to werne, He flyed on high to the temple Apoline, And ther brake his necke for all his grete doctrine. Vo t mer king of Britaine. Likewise the vncertaine buriall of Vortimer, that victorious British king, was in some part of this Citie; he was the eldest sonne of Vortigern king of the Britaines, and raigned as king in his fathers dayes; who demeaned him∣selfe towards his sonne, then his Soueraigne, in all dutifull obedience and faithfull counsell; for the space of foure yeares, euen vntill Vortimer was poysoned by the subtiltie of Rowena the heathen, daughter of Hengist the Saxon, the wife or concubine of his Brother, and the mother of the Bri∣taines mischiefe, which happened about the yeare of Grace 464. Speed. Hist. cap. 12. This Vortimer was a man of great valour, which altogether he employ∣ed for the redresse of his countrey, according to the testimonie of William Malmesbury, whose words are these. Vortimer (saith he) thinking not good to dissemble the matter, for that he saw himselfe and countrey daily surprised by the craft of the Saxons, set his full purpose to driue them out, and from the seuenth yeare after their first entrance, for twentie yeares continuance, fought many battailes with them, and foure of them with great puissance in the open field; in the first whereof, they departed with like fortune, and losse of the Generals bre∣thren Horsa and Latigern : in the other three, the Britaines went away with victory, and so long, vntill Vortimer was taken away by fatall death. It is recorded of him, Sigibert. that after he had vanquished the Saxons, and dis∣possessed them of all their footing in the Continent, yea, and often assailed them in the Isle of Tannet: the Church of Christianitie being ruinated by the Pagan marriage of Rowena with his Brother, as aforesaid, that he resto∣red the Christian Religion, as then sorely decaied, and new built the Chur∣ches that his enemies, the misbeleeuing Saxons had destroied. It is also reported by Nennius of Bangor, in the historie of his countrie, that after his last victorie ouer the Saxons, he caused his monument to be erected at the entrance into Tanet, and in the same place of that great ouer∣throw, which by the said Author, is called Lapis Tituli, of vs the Stonar; where for certaine, it seemes, hath beene an hauen. In this monument, hee commanded his body to be buried, to the further terror of the Saxons, that in beholding this his Trophie, their spirits might be daunted at the remem∣brance of their great ouerthrow. As Scipio Africanus conceited the like, who commanded his Sepulchre to be so set, that it might ouerlooke Africa, supposing that his very Tombe would be a terror to the Carthaginians. But how that desire of Vortimer was performed, I Speed Hist. ca. xi. I finde not, saith a late writer: but rather the contrarie; for an old Manuscript I haue, that confidently af∣firmeth him to be buried in London, which agreeth with these old Rimes of my reuerend Monke of Glocester.

Edward, the eldest sonne of King Edward the fourth, by Queene Eli∣zabeth his wife, say our English Writers, was borne in the Sanctuary at Westminster, Videsis Speed. Hist. ca. 17. and Vincent Catal. Chest r. the fourth of Nouember, and yeare of grace, 1470. being the tenth of his fathers raigne, at that time expulsed the Realme by the power∣full Earle of Warwicke; but fortune being changed, and the father restored, the sonne in Iuly following, the sixe and twentieth day, 1471. was created Prince of Wales, and Earle of Chester; and afterwards vpon the eight of Iuly, in the 19 yeare of his said fathers raign, he was by Letters Patents, da∣ted at Esthamsted, further honoured with the Earledomes of Penbroke and March. He was proclaimed King, but neuer crowned, yet had not the am∣bitious hand of his Vncle beene defiled in his innocent bloud, hee might haue worne the Diadem many yeares, whereas he bare the title of King no longer then two moneths and eighteene daies. Richard, surnamed of Shrewsbury, because he was there borne, the se∣cond sonne of Edward the fourth, by his wife Elizabeth, as aforesaid, was affianced in his infancie, to Anne the onely daughter and heire of Iohn Lord Mowbray Duke of Norfolke; hee was honoured by the titles of Duke of Norfolke, Earle Warren, Earle Marshall, and Nottingham; also Lord Ba∣ron of Mowbray, Segraue, and of Gower, as Milles will haue it; Mill. Catal. Yorke. but inioy∣ing neither wife, title, or his owne life long, was with his brother, murthe∣red in the Tower of London, and in the prison of that Tower, which, vp∣on that most sinfull deed, is euer since called the bloudy Tower, their bo∣dies as yet vnknowne where to haue buriall. The storie of whose death, and supposed interment, extracted out of authenticall Authors, is thus deliue∣red by Iohn Speed. Speed Hist. Prince Edward and his brother (saith hee) were both shut vp in the Tower, and all attendants remoued from them, onely one called Blacke-Will, or William Slaughter excepted, who was set to serue them, and to see them sure. After which time the Prince neuer tied his points, nor cared for himselfe, but with that yong Babe his brother, lingred with thought and heauinesse, till their traiterous deaths deliuered them out of that wretched∣nesse: for the execution whereof, Sir Iames Tirrill appointed Miles For∣rest, a fellow fleshed in murther before time: to whom he ioyned one Iohn Dighton his horse-keeper, a bigge, broad, square knaue. About midnight (all others being remoued from them) this Miles For∣rest, and Iohn Dighton, came into the Chamber, and suddenly wrapped vp the sely children in the Bed-clothes where they lay, keeping, by force, the featherbed and pillowes hard vpon their mouthes, that they were therein smothered to death, and gaue vp to God their innocent soules, into the ioyes of heauen, leauing their bodies vnto the Tormentors, dead in the bed▪ which after these monstrous wretches perceiued, first by the strugling with the paines of death, and after long lying still to bee thorowly dispat∣ched, they laid their bodies naked out vpon the bed, and then fetched Sir Iames Tirrill their instigator, to see them, who caused these murtherers to bury them at the staires foot, somewhat deepe in the ground, vnder a great heape of stones. Then ro e Sir Iames in haste to the King, vnto whom he shewed the manner of their death, and place of buriall; which newes was so welcome to his wicked heart, as hee greatly reioyced, and with great thankes dubbed (as some hold) this his mercilesse Instrument, Knight. But the place of their buriall he liked not, saying, that vile corner should not containe the bodies of those Princes, his Nephewes, and commanded them a better place for buriall, because they were the Sons of a King. Where∣upon the Priest of the Tower tooke vp their bodies, and secretly interred them in such a place, which by the occasion of his death, could neuer since come to light. The continuer of Iohn Harding tels vs from the report of others, that King Richard caused Sir Robert Brakenburies Priest to close their dead corpes in lead, and so to put them in a coffin full of holes, and hooked at the ends with two hookes of iron, and so to cast them into a place called the Blacke deepes at the Thames mouth, whereby they should neuer rise vp, or be any more seene. To which effect I haue seene their Epitaph written by Thomas Stanley, Bishop of Man, Parson of Winwicke, and Wigan in Lancashire, who lou∣rished in the seuerall raignes of King Henry the eight, Edward the sixt, Queene Mary, and Queene Elizabeth ▪ thus it runs in his Lancashire rimes. In Londons Toure in one plase or anoder Interryd lay Kyng Edward and his Broder, Who by there wicked Vncle. Eme were guyltles sleyne, And basely beryd, yet tooke vp ageyne And cast into the blacke deepes at Tems mouth. Now whether wreckt, or tost from North to South, Their reliques are, it recks not; ther soules rest In Heu'n amangst Gods children euer blest. They weren murdered in Iuly, 1483. Edward being thirteene yeres old, and Richard about some two yeres yonger. The iust iudgement of God seuerely reuenged the murther of these inno¦cent Princes vpon the malefactors. For first to begin with the Ministers; Miles Forrest at Saint Martins, peece-meale rotted away; Sir Iames Tirril died at Tower hill for treason committed against Henry the seuenth; Digh¦ton indeed (saith my Author, The Continu∣er of Hardings Chronicle. who liued in those times) walketh on aliue, in good possibility to be hanged ere he die, liuing at Calleis, no lesse distai∣ned and hated, then pointed at of all. King Richard himselfe was slaine in the field, hacked and hewed of his enemies hands, harried on a horse backe naked, being dead, his haire in despite torne and tugged like a curre dogge. And the mischiefe that he tooke, was within lesse then three yeares of the mischiefe that he did, and yet all the meane time spent in much paine and trouble outward, and much feare, anguish, and sorrow within. For I haue heard by credible report of his Chamberlaine, The guilty conscience of King Richard that after this abhominable deed done, he neuer was quiet in his minde: he neuer thought himselfe sure, for where he went abroad, his eyes euer whirled about, his body was pri∣uily fenced, his hand was euer on his dagger, his countenance and manner was like one euer ready to strike againe; he tooke ill rest a nights, lay long waking and musing, sore wearied with care and watch, rather slumbred, then slept, troubled with fearefull dreames, sodainly some times start vp, leapt out of his bed, and ran about the chambers; so was his restlesse heart continually tossed and tumbled, with the tedious impression and stormy remembrance of his execrable murthers. Persius makes an imprecation to Iupiter, that hee would punish Kings, committing such horride actions, with this horrour of conscience, thus. Pers. Sat. 3. trans. by erten Holyday. Great Father of the gods: when cruell lust, Touch'd with inflaming venome, moues th' vniust Corrupted disposition of fierce Kings, To act unworthy and vnkingly things: Punish them onely thus. Let them but see Faire vertue, and their lost felicitie. Then shall their bowels yearne, and they shall crie In secret, and waxe pale, and pine, and die. But here enough of King Richard, vntill I come to Leicester, and there to the place of his buriall. Chelsey. Sir Thomas Moore Lord Chancelor. On the south side of the Quire of this Church, vnder a plaine Monu∣ment, lieth the body of Sir Thomas More, Lord Chancelor of England, beheaded on the Tower hill, for denying of the Kings Supremacie, the sixt of Iuly, 1535. Ouer his Tombe is an Inscription vpon the wall, made by himselfe, a little after he gaue ouer his Office of being Chancelour, now hardly to be read. Thomas Morus vrbe Londinensi, familia non celebri, sed honesta natus, in literis vtcumque versatus, quum & causas aliquot Iuuenis egisset in for , et in vrbe sua pro Shyre o ius dixisset, ab inuictissimo Rege Henrico viii.

At filius defuncto patre, cui, quamdiu superarat, comparatus, & inuenis & ipse quoque sibi videbatur, amissam iam Patrem requirens & editos ex se liberos quatuor, ac nepotes vn∣decim respiciens apud animum suum cepit persenescere. Auxit hunc affectum animi, subsequuta velut adpetentis sen signum, pectoris valetudo deterior. Itaque mortalium harum rerum satur, quam rem à puero semper optauerat, vt vltimos vite sue annos obtineret liberos, quibus hu us vite negotijs paula∣tim se subducens, futuram posset immortalitatem meditari, eam rem tandem (sic ceptis annuat Deus) indulgentissimi Principis incomparabili beneficio resignatis honoribus impetrauit. Atque hoc Sepulchrum sibi, quod mortis eam nunquam cessantis adrepere commonefaceret, translatis huc prioris vx ris ossibus, extruendum curauit. Quod ne superstes frustra sibi secerit, neue ingruentem trepidus horreat, sed desiderio Christi lubens oppetat, mortem∣que vt sibi non omnino mortem, sed tanuam vite felicioris inveniat, precibus eum, Lector optime, spirantem, precor, defunctumque prosequere. Sir Thomas More, hauing remoued the body of his first wife Ioane to this place intended for his owne buriall, composed this Epitaph to her me∣mory; which I haue read. Clara Thome iacet hic Ioanna vxorcula Mori, Ioan and Alice the wiues of Sir Tho. Mor . in bib. Cot. Qui tumulum Alicie hunc destino quoque tibi. Vna mihi dedit hoc coniuncta virentibus unnis Me vocet vt puer, & trina puella Patrem. Altera priuignis (que gloria rara Nouerce est) Tam pia quam gnatis vix fuit vlla suis. Altera sic mecum vixit, sic altera viuit, Charior incertum est, hec sit an hec fuerit. O simul, O iuncti poteramus viuere nos tros Quam bene si factum Religioque sinant. Et societ tumulus, societ nos obsecro celum, Sic mors non potuit quod dare vita dabit.

Of the Office of Remembrancers, whereof William the father of this Thomas Essex here entombed, was one and the chiefe: giue mee leaue to speake a little out of the Interpreter. Remembrancers of the Exchequer (Rememoratores) bee three Officers or Clerks. One called the Kings Remembrancer, Ann. 35. Eli. cap. 5. The other the Lord Treasurers Remembrancer. Vpon whose charge it seemeth to lye, that they put all Iustices of that Court, as the Lord Treasurer, and the rest, in remembrance of such things as are to be called on, and dealt in for the Princes behoofe. The third is called the Remembrancer of the first-fruits. Of these you may reade something, Ann. 5. Ric. 2. Stat. 1. cap. 14. and 15. to the effect aboue specified. These An 37. Ed. 3. cap. 4. be called Clerkes of the Remembrance. It seemeth that the name of the Officer is borrowed from the Civilians, who haue their Memoriales, qui sunt notarij Cancellariae in regno subiecti officio Quaestoris. Lucas de Penna. C. lib. 10 tit. 12. num. 7. The Kings Re∣membrancer. The Kings Remembrancer entreth into his Office all Recog∣nisances, taken before the Barons for any the Kings debts, for apparences, or for obseruing of orders. He taketh all bonds for any of the Kings debts, or for appearance, or for obseruing of orders, and maketh proces vpon them for the breach of them. He writeth proces against the Collectours of Cu∣stomes, Subsedies, and Fiueteenths for their accounts. All informations vpon penall Statutes are entred in his Office. And all matters vpon English Bills in the Exchequer Chamber are remaining in his Office. Hee maketh the Bills of compositions vpon penall Lawes, taketh the stalments debts, maketh a Record of a Certificate deliuered to him by the Clerkes of the Starre-Chamber of the Fines there set, and sendeth them to the Pipe. Hee hath deliuered to his Office all manner of Indentures, fines, and other Eui∣dences whatsoeuer, that concerne the assuring of any lands to the Crowne. He yearely, in Crastino Animarum, readeth in open Court the Statute for election of Sheriffes, and giueth those that choose them their oath. He rea∣deth in open Court the oath of all the Officers of the Court, when they are admitted. The Treasurers Remembrancer maketh Proces against all Sheriffes, The Treasurers Remembran∣cer. Es∣cheators, Receiuers, and Bayliffes, for their accounts. He maketh Proces of Fieri Facias, and extent for any debts due to the King, either in the Pipe, or with the Auditors. He maketh Proces for all such reuenue as is due to the King by reason of his tenures. He maketh a Record, whereby it appeareth whether Sheriffes and other accountants keepe their dayes of prefixion. All extreats of fines, issues, and amerciaments set in any Courts of West∣minster, or at the Assises, or Sessions, are certified into his Office; and are by him deliuered to the Clerke of Extreats to write Proces vpon them. He hath also brought into his Office all the accounts of Customers, Controul∣lers, and other accomptants, to make thereof an entrie of Record. The Remembrancer of the first-fruits taketh all Compositions for first-fruits and Tenths; Remembran∣cer of the first-fruits. and maketh Proces against such as pay not the same.

So named of the most holy Mount Sion, The foundati∣on of Sion. which King Henry the fift, when he had expelled thence the Monkes Aliens, built for religious Vir∣gins, to the honour of our Sauiour, the Virgin Mary, and Saint Bridget of Sion: Nuns and Priests Augu∣stines. In which house he appointed to the glory of God, so many Nunnes, Priests, and lay Brethren, as were in number equall to Christ his Apostles and Disciples; namely of Virgines sixtie, Priests thirteene, Deanes foure, and lay Brethren eight. These two Couents had but one Church in com∣mon, the Nunnes had their Church aloft in the roofe, and the brethren be∣neath vpon the ground; each Couent seuerally inclosed, and neuer allow∣ed to come out, except by the Popes speciall licence.

A Lettore certefyinge the incontynensye of the Nunnes of Syon with the Friores, and aftere the acte done, the Friores reconsile them to God. Endorsed. To the right honourable, Master Thomas Cromwell, chiefe Secre∣tary to the Kyngs highnesse. It maye plese your goodnesse to vnderstand that Bushope this daye pre∣ched and declared the Kynges tytelle very well, Ex lit. in Bib. S. Dewes. and hade a grete Audy∣ense, the Chorche full of people, one of the Focaces in his said declaration, openly called him false knaue, with other foolish words, it was that foolish fellow with the corled head that kneeled in your waye when you came foorth of the Confessores Chamber. I can noe lese doe, but set him in pri∣sone, vt pena eius sit metus alioram : yesterday I learned many enormeous things against Bushope, in the examinacion of the lay Brederen; first that Bushop perswaded towe of the Brederene to haue gone their wayes by night, and he himselfe with them, and to the accomplishment of that, they lacked but money to buy them seculere apparell: Forther, that Bushope would haue perswaded one of his laye Brederen a Smithe, to haue made a keaye for the doare, to haue in the night time receiued in Wenches for him and his fellowes, and specially a wyffe of Vxebridge, now dwelling not farre from the old Lady Derby, nigh Vxbridge: which wyffe his old cu∣stomer hath byne many tymes here at the grates communyng with the said, and e was desirous to haue her conuoyed in to him. The said Bushope also perswaded a Nunne, to whom he was Confessor, Ad libidinem corporis perimplend. And thus he perswaded her in Confession, making her beleeue, that whensoeuer, and as ofte as they shold medle together, if she were, i ∣mediately after, confessed by him, and tooke of him absolution, shee shold be cleere forgeuen of God, and it shold be none offence vnto her before God. And she writte diueres and sundrye lettores vnto him of such their foolishnesse and vnthri tynesse, and wold haue had his Broder the Smith to haue polled out a barre of iron of that window, whereas ye examyned the Ladye Abbas, that he might haue gone in to her by night. And that same window was their commoning place by night. He perswaded the Sex∣tene that he wold be in his contemplacion in the Chorche by night, and by that meanes was many nightes in the Chorche talkyng with her at the said grate of the Nunnes Quire, and there was ther meeting place by night, besides their day communications, as in confession: it were too long to declare all things of him that I haue hard, which I suppos is true. This afternoone I intend to make forder serche, both of some of the Brederen, and some also of the Sisters for such like matteres; if I fynde any thing ap∣parent to be true, I shall God wyllynge therof sertefy your Mastorshipe to morowe, by vii in the mornyng. And aftor this daye I suppos there will be no other things to be knowne as yet here; for I haue already examined all the Brederen, and many of them wold gladly departe hense, and be righte weary of their habbyte: such Religion and fained sancterye, God saue me froe. If Master Bedle had byne here a Frior, and of Bushopes Counsell, hee wold right welle haue helped him to haue broghte his mattores to passe▪ without brekyng vppe of any grate or yet counterfettyng of keayes, such capassetye God hathe sent him.

This race of le Strange, continued for many descents in the dignity of Lord Barons, in latine Records, called Extranei, for that they were Stran∣gers, brought hither by King Henry the second, the yeare 1148. This Iohn Lord Strange, here intombed, was the laft of that Surname, Baron of Knocking : for Sir George Stanley, sonne and heire of Thomas, Lord Stan∣ley, Earle of Darby, the first of that name, married Ioane, the sole daughter and heire of the aforesaid Iohn Lord Strange, here mentioned, who to her fathers memory, made this monument, with whom he had both her fa∣thers honours, and ample inheritance; of which, Thomas Stanley ▪ sometime Lord Bishop of Man, in his pedegree of the Stanleyes, speaking of Thomas, the first Earle, thus makes his rime, a Mss.

These Brents were Gentlemen of ample possessions in this tract, whose chiefe residence was in Brentstreet, Specul. Brit. hereunto adioyning; from whom (saith Norden ) that street tooke her denomination: As also the little Brooke of Brent, which giueth name to Brentford, now called Brainford. Fowke de Brent. The most remarkable man of this Surname, was one Falcatius, or Falke, de Brent, who for his matchlesse prowesse, and all-daring forwardnesse, was so beloued of king Iohn, that he gaue him in marriage Margaret, the daugh∣ter of Warrin Fitz-Gerald his Chamberlaine, late the wife of Baldwin de Riuers, sonne of William Earle of Deuon and Exceter. A match thought farre vnfit for such a man; but the King would haue it so. Whereupon this was written. Mat Westminst. Lex connectit cos, amor & concordia lecti, Sed Lex qualis? amor qualis? concordia qualis? Lex exlex, amor exosus, concordia discors. This Fowke liued in the like grace and fauour, with king Hen. the third, for by his fierie valour the said king got the victorie at Lincolne, against Lewis the sonne of the second Philip king of France, and his owne rebelli∣ous Barons. But not long after, looking ouer much vpon the height of his Fortunes, and remembring too often his former good Seruices to the State, he (presuming vpon his Soueraignes lenitie) committed many horrible out∣rages, for which (after pardon of his life hardly obtained) he was adiudged to perpetuall banishment, Mat.

I thinke it not much amisse to speake a little of this Protomartyr of En∣gland, Saint Alban, whose reliques lie here interred, to whose name, and for his eternall commemoration, both this Towne and Monastery wer built and consecrated. He was a Citizen and a Knight of that famous Citie Verulam, (which stood hereby beyond the little riuer) who giuing entertainement at his own house, to Amphibalus a Christian, and one of the Clergie, was by him his guest, conuerted from Paganisme, to the true profession of Iesus Christ: and when Dioclesian (who made Maximian his companion in the Empire) went about by exquisite torments, to wipe Christian Religion quite out of the memory of men, was the first in Britaine, that with inuincible constan∣cie and resolution, suffered death for Christ his sake: of which persecution, s also of his Martyrdome, my often alledged Author, Robert of Glocester, shall tell you in his old verse. Two Emperors of Rome wer on Dioclesian, And anoder hys felaw that het Maximian. And wer both at on tym, the on in the Este ende, The oder in the west of the world, alle cristendom to shende. For the luther Maximian westwarde hider soughte, And christen men that he fonde to strang deth he broughte. Churchen he pulde a doun, ther ne moste non stonde, And al the bokes that he myghte fynde in eny londe, He wolde late berne echon, amydde the heygh strete, And the christenmen asle, and non alyue lete. Such God was yvor vpon cristendom. Such persecucion as ther was hadde ther be non. For yun a monethe ther wer seuentene thou send and mo, I martred for our Lordes Loue: nas ther a grete wo? Wyth oute oder grete halwen that hii heold longe in torment. As Seynt Cristene, and Seynt Feye, and also Seynt Uincent, Fabian and Sebastian, and othur as men rede, That heold faste in the fey, and hadde non drede, And among men of this londe ther wer many on I martred at thulke tym, Seint Albon was on: He was the furste Martir of Brutayn that com Muche was the shome men dude in Christendom, Undyr this Luther Emperor. Another not so ancient, hath it thus. The Emperour Dioclesyan Into Britayne then sent Maximian: Hardin cap. 7. This Maximian to surname Hercelius, A Tyraunte false that Christente anoyed, Through all Britayne, of werke malicious, The christoned folke felly and sore destroyed. And thus the people with him foule accloyed, Religyous men the Prests and Clerkes all▪ Wemen with chylde and bedred folkes all. Chyldren soukyng vpon the mothers pappis, The mothers also withouten any pytee, And chyldren all in their mothers lappis The crepyls eke and all the christentee, He killed and slewe with full grete cruelte. The Churches brent, all bokes or ornaments Bellys, reliquys that to the Churche appendes, He slew that tyme, and martyred Saint Albone. Now when neither perswasions, nor cruell torments, could make him forsake the true faith, Iacobus de ∣ragine, transla∣ted. such was the sentence of his death, as I finde it in a legend of his passion and martyrdome, which to giue your palate variety, I will set downe in such English as I haue in the said Legend, or Agon. In the tyme of the Emperoure Dioclesyan, Albone Lorde of Uerolamye, Prynce of Knyghts, and Stewarde of all Brutayne durynge his lif, hath despysyd Iupiter and A∣pollo. Iubyter and Apollyn oure Goddes; and to them hath doo derogacyon and disworschyp, wherfor by the Lawe, he is iudged to be deed by the honde of somme knyght, and the body to be buried in the same place, where his heed shal be smyten of, and his sepulture to be made worshcip∣fully for thonoure of knyghthode wherof he was Prynce, and also the crosse whych he bare, and A Palmers Weed. Sklauin that he ware shold be bu∣ried wyth hym, and his body to be closyd in a Cheste of leed, and so layed in his sepulture: This sentence hath the Lawe ordeyned, by cause he hath renyed our principall Goddes. His iudgement being giuen after this manner, he was brought from the Citie Veralam, to this his place of execution, which, as then, was an hill in a wood, called Holme-hurst, where at one stroke his head was smitten off. But his Executioner, saith venerable Bede, Bed lib. 1. c. . had short ioy of his wicked deede, for his eyes fell to the ground, with the head of the holy Martyr: of which will you heare another writer. Thousands of torments when he had endur'd for Christ his sake, Vid Camd. in Hert. At length he died by dome thus giuen; his head away to take. The Tortor proudly did the feat, but cleere he went not quit, That holy Martyr lost his head, this cruell wretch his sight. He suffered martyrdome in the yeare of Christ, saith Stow, 293. the twentieth day of Iune, saith Bede, howsoeuer the two and twentieth day of the same moneth▪ was appointed by the Church, to be kept holy to his memory, as we haue it in our English Calender. Many Miracles are said to be wrought by this sacred Martyr, both li∣uing and dead, but I will leaue them, (for that they will be thought incre∣dulous in this age) and come to the foundation of this Abbey. The Sepulchres of holy Saints, the reliques of blessed Martyrs, and the very places of their martyrdome, The foundati∣on of S. Albans Abbey. did kindle, in times past, no small heate of diuine charitie in the mindes of our first Christian Saxon Kings; which made Offa the glorious King of the Mercians, to recall himselfe from the trace of bloudy warres, in great deuotion to goe to Rome, and to obtaine of Pope Adrian the first, the canonyzation of this martyr Alban ; in honour of whom, the first to our Lord Iesus Christ, he founded this monastery, a∣bout the yeere 795. (the Church whereof still remaineth, which for big∣nesse, beautie, and antiquity, is to be had in admiration) in the very place where the foresaid Alban suffered his martyrdome. He endowed this his g odly fabricke, with sufficient reuenues for the maintenance of one hun∣dred blacke Monkes, Benedictins, and caused the reliques of his new Saint to be taken vp, and put in a shrine, adorned with gold and pretious stones of inestimable value; which was further enriched by his sonne Egfrid, and many other succeeding Kings and Princes, but now at this day, nothing is remaining of this rich Shrine, saue a marble stone, to couer his sacred Ashes; ouer against which, on the wall, these verses are lately depicted, onely to tell vs that such a man there was, to whose memory a Shrine was erected. Renowned Alban knight, first Martyr of this land, By Dioclesian lost his life through bloudy hand. Who made him soueraigne Lord, high Steward of this Isle, And Prince of Britaine knights to dignifie his stile, He veritie embrac't, and Verulam forsooke, And in this very place his martyrdome he tooke. Now hath he his reward, he liues with Christ aboue, For he aboue all things, Christ and his truth did loue. Here Offa, Mercians King, did Albans bones enshrine, So all things were dispos'd by prouidence diuine. Nought but this marble stone of Albans Shrine is left, The worke of all forme else, hath changing time bereft. I haue read in an old Mss. in Sir Robert Cottons Librarie, that this fol∣lowing, was anciently the Inscription vpon his Shrine. Here lieth interred, the body of Saint Alban, a Citizen of old Verulam, of whom this towne tooke denomination, and from the ruines of which Citie, this Towne did arise. He was the first Martyr of England, and suffe∣red his martyrdome the xx. day of Iune, in the yeare of mans redemption, 293. Vnder a curious and costly funerall monument here in the Quire, lyeth interred the body of Vmfrey Plantaginet, Vm hrey Duke of Glocester. Milles Catal. surnamed the Good, fourth sonne of King Henry the fourth. By the grace of God (for so begins his stile by Charter) sonne, brother, and vncle of Kings, Duke of Glocester, Earle of Henault, Holland, Zeland, and Pembroke, Lord of Friseland, great Cham∣berlaine of England, Protector and defender of the Church and kingdome of England. Thus great, thus glorious, by birth, creation, and marriage, was hee in his honourable titles and Princely attributes; but farre more great, and illustrious, in his vertuous endowments, and inward qualities: But in his praise, may it please you reade learned Clarentieux, in his tract of Suffolke, where he writes of the Abbey of Bury: these are his words. That father of his countrey, Vmfrey Duke of Glocester, a due obseruer of Iustice, and one who had furnished his noble wit, with the better and deeper kinde of Studies, after he had, vnder King Henry the sixth, gouerned the king∣dome fiue and twenty yeares with great commendations; so that neither good men had cause to complaine of, nor enuill to finde fault with, was here in Saint Sauiours Hospitall brought to his by the spightfull enuie of Margaret of Lorain, who was wife to Hen the ix h his Nephew. But his death was the stroke of an euill Angell, Speed. ent to punish Eng∣land, and to roote out all her Nobles. Fidior in regno regi duce non uit is o, Plusue fide stabilis, aut maior amator honoris. Saith the Abbot of this house Io. Whethamsted ; yet for all this was he ar∣rested of high Treason, in the yeare 1446. and within few dayes after strang∣led to death; Stow. Annal. without any triall. Some say he died for sorrow, because hee might not come to his answer. Hee built the Diuinitie Schoole in Oxford, and was an especiall benefactour to this Abbey. Here is an Epitaph pensild on the wall neare to his Tombe, to the same effect; with an Item of the mi∣racle which he wrought vpon the blinde imposture. The story is frequent. Hic iacet Vmphredus Duxille Glocestrius, olim Henrici Regis Protector, fraudis ineptae Detector; dum ficta notat miracula caeci. Lumen erat Patriae, columen venerabile Regni: Pacis amans, Musisque fauens, melioribus; vnde Gratum opus Oxonio, quae nunc scola sacra refulget. Invida sed mulier regno, Regi, sibi nequam Abstulit hunc, humili vix hoc dignata Sepulchro. Invidia rumpente tamen post funera viuit. Vnder a large marble stone thus inscribed, lieth Iohn Stoke, Io. Stoke Abbot an Abbot of This Church. Hic iacet oblitus Stoke stans velut ardua quercus Semper in adversis perstitit intrepidus. Wallingford Prior hic gregis huius pastor, & Abbas, Donet ei requiem celsa dei pietas. Celica regna bone mihi dentur queso Patrone. Penas compesse, requiem da virgula Iesse. Me precor Amphibale soluens ad sidera sume. Mss. in bib. Cott This Abbot (as it is in this Epitaph, and in the golden Register of this house) was a stout defender of the lands and liberties of his Church: hee adorned Duke Vmfreys Tombe; hee gaue money, by his Will, to make a new bell, which after his owne name was called Iohn ; and also to new glase the Cloisters, Sibi igitur (saith the booke) ea sit merces, que dari solet illis qui ad honorem sue Ecclesie, laudabilia student opera in temporibus suis. Vpon a Prior of this house. Vir crucis & Christi tumulo iacet inclitus isti, Carcere de tristi saluetur sanguine Christi. Armacrucis sumpsit intrando Religionem; Mundum contempsit propter celi regionem. Hic studuit claustri Pondus sufferre laboris, In stadio studij a reward. brauium percepit honoris: Flatus fortune grandes patiens tolerabat, Gaudia, tristitia, equalilance librabat. Nil aduersa timens, nec multum prospera curans; Se medio tenuit; per ferrea tempora durans. Omni gestura constans nil triste timebat; Omni pressura Christo laudes referebat. Armis Iustitie cinctus deitatis amore Hostibus Ecclesie restitit in facie. Ad tumulum Proceres mors impia transferet omnes; Vt puerilis amor defluit omnis honor. I finde this Inscription following vpon a faire marble, vnder the pour∣traiture of one of the Abbots, who modestly thus suppresseth his name. Hic quidem terra tegitur Peccato soluens debitum. Cuius nomen non impositum, In libro vitae sit inscriptum. Michael Abbot Hic iacet Dominus Michael quondam Abbas huius Monasterij Bacha∣laureus in Theol. qui obiit pridie Idus Aprilis Ann. M.ccc xlii. Michael Abbas (saith the said booke of S. Albans ) merito nomen Ange∣licum est sortitus, nam opera que ipse fecit, ostendunt qualis fuerit. Fuitque in omni vita tam pius suis fratribus & mansuetus, vt inter eos merito tan∣quam Angelus haberetur. Gulielmus quartus opus hoc laudabile, cuius Extitit, hic pausat, Christo sibi premia reddat. This Abbots name was William Wallingford, a man abundantly cha∣ritable to the poore, and munificent to the Church. His gifts to both did amount to the summe of eight thousand and threescore pounds seuen shil∣lings and sixe pence (confirmed in the said booke) by Thomas Ramridge then Prior, and the rest of the Couent, in the yeare 1484. Die octauo mens. Augusti ; concluding with these words: Ex his igitur premissis manifestis∣sime cernere possumus, quam vtilis & quam carissimus suo olim Monasterio extiterit. Ea propter sinceris omnes cordilus, ad omnipotentem deum, pro eo precaturi dies ac noctes deuotissime sumus, vt sibi in celis mercedem suis fa∣ctis dignissimam retribuere dignetur. Amen. Hic iacet... Th mas Abbot. Thomas Abbas huins Monastery.... This is the last Abbot for whom I finde any Inscription, or Epitaph, and the last in my Catalogue: whose Surname was Ramrige, Vir suis tempori∣bus tam dilectus deo quam hominibus, propterque causas varias nomen in per∣petua benedictione apud posteros habens ▪ saith the golden Register. Here I may haue occasion to set downe the names of all the Abbots of this House, In bib. Cott. from the first foundation to this man; and the rather because I haue certaine Epitaphs in some of their commendations, collected out of the Abbey booke, which sometime were engrauen vpon their Monuments: besides other passages are thereby discouered, not vnpleasing to the Reader. When Offa the Founder had built and endowed this Monasterie, illigod the first Abbot. with more then twenty Lordships and Mannors, and obtained for it all royall priuiledges, and pontificall ornaments: he made choice of one Willigod, to haue the gouernment of these possessions and prerogatiues, as also of the re∣ligious persons by him to his Abbey promoted. This man did laudablie gouerne his charge for many yeares. 2. Eadrick succeeded him, a seuere punisher of malefactours. 3. Then Wulsigge. 4. Wulnoth, in this Abbots time many miracles are said to be wrought at Saint Albons Shrine. 5. Eadfride : this Abbot gaue a massie cup of gold, or challice of inesti∣mable value to the Shrine of Saint Albon. 6. Wulfine, a village of a few houses being here alreadie built neare to the Monastery, this Abbot procured a Market there to be kept; and called together people of other villages therin to inhabite. He built the Churches of Saint Peter and Saint Michael in this Towne, and a Chappell neare to S. Germans Chappell, which he dedicated to Saint Mary Magdalene. 7. Alfricke, this Abbot for a great summe of money purchased a large and deepe pond, lying betwixt old Verulam and this village (an euill neigh∣bour and hurtfull to his Church) which was called the Fish poole, apper∣taining to the kings: and the Kings officers and Fishers molested the Ab∣bey, and burdened the Monkes thereby. Out of which Poole he the said Abbot in the end drained the water, and made it drie ground. The name of which Pond or Poole remaineth still here in a certaine street, called Fish-poole street. 9. Ealdred, the Abbot in the raigne of king Edgar, hauing searched for the ancient vaults vnder ground at Verulam, ouerthrew all, and stopped vp all the wayes with passages vnder ground; which were strongly and artificial∣ly arched ouer head: For they were the lurking holes of whores and theeues. Hee leuelled the ditches of the Citie, and certaine dennes, into which malefactours vse to flie, as vnto places of refuge. But the whole tiles and stones which he found fit for building, he laid aside; intending there∣with to haue reedified his Church, but he was preuented by death. 9. Eadmer his Successor went forward with the worke that Ealfred be∣gan, and his pioners ouerthrew the foundations of a pallace in the midst of the old Citie: And in the hollow place of a wall, as it were in a little closet, they happened vpon bookes, couered with oaken boards, and silken strings at them: whereof one contained the life of Saint Alban, written in the Bri∣tish tongue; the rest, the ceremonies of the Heathen. When they opened the ground deeper, they met with old tables of stone, with tiles also and pillars, likewise with pitchers and pots of earth, made by Potters and Tur∣ners worke: vessells moreouer of glasse, containing the ashes of the dead, &c. To conclude, out of these remaines of Verulam, Eadmer built a new the most part of his Church and Monasterie; with a determination to haue finished all: Sed tamen morte preuentus, saith the booke, propositum suum non est assecutus. 10. Leofricke was preferred to the Archbishopricke of Canterbury, who departing with the benediction of his brethren, left his Monastery abun∣dantly rich. This man is omitted in the Catalogue of Bishops, or otherwise Aluric us or Alfricus is set in his place. 11. This Alfricke or Aluricke was the eleuenth Abbot, and brother by the mothers side to his predecessour Leofricke ; he compiled an Historie of the life and death of Saint Alban, and hee, together with his brother, got and gaue nine villages to this Abbey. 12 Leofstane procured many great and important liberties to his Church, of Edward the Counfessour, whose Chaplaine and Confessour the said Ab∣bot was; and who, betwixt the King and his Queene Editha, was Casti consilij seminator. 13. Fredericke the bold and rich Abbot of Saint Albans (for so he was called) succeeded Leofstane, descended from the Saxons noble bloud, as likewise from Canutus the Dane: this man opposed the Conquerour Willi∣am in all his proceedings, plotted against him in diuers conspiracies, and told him stoutly to his face, that he had done nothing but the dutie of his birth and profession; and if others of his ranke had performed the like (as they well might and ought) it had not beene in his power to haue pierced the land so farre. But this, and other his ouer-bold answers, did so offend the King, that he tooke from him this Abbey of Saint Albans, with all the lands and reuenues belonging thereunto, which lay betwixt Barnet and London stone. Whereupon, without delay, hee called a Chapter of his Brethren, shewing them their approaching dangers, and to auoide the pre∣sent storme, went himselfe to Ely (where he desisted not from his wonted machinations against the Conquerour) and there ended his dayes, in mag∣na mentis amaritudine (saith mine Author) postquam multis annis huic Ec∣clesie nobiliter prefuisset. 14. Paul a Monke of Cane, vpon his death, was made Abbot, who in short space by the counsell and aide of Lanfranke, Archbishop of Canter∣bury, builded very sumptuously a new Church, with a Cloister here, with a l offices; and adorned the same Church with many good bookes, and rich ornaments. He procured his lands and reuenues backe againe from the Con∣querour; and by himselfe, and his forcible perswasions with others, he did further enrich his Abbey with many faire possessions. 15 Richard succeeded him, who solemnly & magnificently did consecrate the Church, which his predecessour Paul had finished, and built a Chap∣pell of himselfe to the honour of Saint Cuthbert, in which hee was entom∣bed, with this Epitaph. Abbas Richardus iacet hic, vt pistica nardus Redolens virtutum floribus et merit is. A quo fundatus locus est hic, edisicatus Ingenti studio nec modico precio. Quem nonas decimas Februo promente Kalendas, Abslulit vltima sors, et rapuit cita mors. 16 Geffrey the Abbot gaue many rich ornaments to this his Monastery, with a Challice and a couer all of massie pure gold, which afterwards hee sent to Pope Celestine the second, vt ipsius sedaret auaritiam, volent is hanc Ecclesiam appropriare ; that he might appease or mitigate the couetousnesse of his holy father of Rome, who was willing (and went about) to impro∣priate this Abbey. Abbas Galfridus Papa cui fuit ipse molestus Hic iacet innocuus, prudens, pius, atque modeslus. 17 Raph his successor, built anew the lodgings for the Abbots, and gaue diuers rich Copes and Vestments for the ornament of his Church. 18 Robert was the next Abbot who procured the Church of Luton to be annexed to this, S. Albans ex∣empre from the of Lincoln and deliuered his Monastery from the seruitude of the Bishop of Lincolne, which was a controuersie of long continuance, and in the end agreed vpon by composition; which agreement was confirmed by Alexander the third, Bishop of Rome, about the yeare 1178. as by his Bull to that purpose appearent.

Richard Cordelion, King of England, be∣ing taken prisoner by Leopold Duke of Austria, and his ransome set at one hundred thousand pound; commandement was directed from his Iustices, that all Bishops, Prelates, Earles, Barons, Abbots, and Priors, should bring in the fourth part of their reuenues towards his deliuerance: at which time the shrines in the Churches were fleeced, and their Chalices coined into ready money, yet this Abbot (quia Regi erat amicissimus) redeemed the Chalices, and all other the rich offerings to the glorious shrines within his Church, for two hundred markes. This Carine was the first Abbot of this house, that was dignified with Miter and Croisier. 21 Iohn de Cella did many workes of piety, and purchased the Church of Saint Stephen, with certaine lands thereunto adioyning, for one hundred and twenty markes, which he did assigne to the Officers of his Kitchin. 22 William, amongst many of his pious acts, reedified Saint Cuthberts Chappell, being as then ruinous and ready to fall downe; which hee new made in the honour of Saint Cuthbert, Saint Iohn the Baptist, and Saint Agnes the Virgine; vpon which dedication he caused these verses to be in∣sculped ouer the high Altar. Confessor Cuthberte Dei Baptista Iohannes, Agnes virgo, tribus vobis hec ara sacratur. 23 Iohn of Hertford was a great benefactor to this Abbey. 24 His successor Roger did wondrously loue the beautie of the house of God, which he euidently did demonstrate by the great cost and charges he bestowed vpon this his owne Church: besides, he caused to be made, three tunable Bels for the Steeple, two to the honour of Saint Alban, and the third to Saint Amphibalus, which he appointed to be rung at nine a clocke euery night; whereupon it was called the Corfue, or couer fire bell. 25 After Roger, succeeded Iohn of Berkamstede, of whom because hee did nothing memorable in his life time, nothing shall be spoken in this pre∣sent page; Sed taman Lectorem monemus (saith the Booke) vt conuertatur ad pietatis opera, et omnipotenti deo pro eius anima preces fundat. 26 Iohn Marines gaue a Censer to his church, of a great price, besides many other necessaries. 27 Hugh his successor, inlarged the reuenues of his church with many faire possessions, and obtained of Edward the second, diuers great gifts, with a crucifixe of gold, beset with precious stones; a cup of siluer of great value, gilt, diuers Scottish reliques. Timber to repaire the Quire, and one hundred pound in money. Quid fuit, est, et erit, cur non homo discere querit? Spuma fuit, fumus est: putrida fiet humus. 28 Abbot Richard, endued with all kindes of learning, both morall and diuine, suffered great tribulation in his time, in the defence of the rights of his church. He gaue a clocke to the same, the like of it was not in England. 29 Of Michael the Abbot I haue spoken before. 30 Vpon the death of Michael, Thomas the Prior of Tinmouth was preferred to this monasterie: he sustained innumerable crosses and pertur∣bations, during the time of his being at Tinmouth, as also here at Saint Albanes: yet brought all to a prosperous end, and adorned his church more richly, then any one of his Predecessors; the particular gifts that he gaue to the same, cost him aboue foure thousand pound. Est Abbas Thomas, tumulo presente reclusus Qui vite tempus sanctos expendit in vsus. 31 The next Abbot was Iohn Moot, qui multa fecit diebus suis memoran∣da, saith my Author, of whom this Epitaph. M. C. quater vint. quint. Claudis heic membra Ioannis, Qui dignis laudibus veteranis occidit annis: Intus confratres bene rexit, post fuit Abbas Constans vt Iosua, Zelans legem vt H lias.

Omnem patratum Christus purgando reatum, Nobis sublatum te mun ret his sociatum. 32 William his next successour, was vir suis in temporibus tam deo delectus quam hominibus, and performed many great workes of pietie. Hee died about the yeare 1434. for whom I finde this Epitaph. Conditus his recubat fatali sorte Guilelmus Albani Pastor qui gregis aptus erat: Reperit illustrem celesti munere famam, Quam nequit in tanto mors abolere viro. 33 But now I come to Iohn of Whethamstede, (a village in this shire, plentifull in wheate) (wherein the said Iohn was borne, and thereupon had his denomination,) who was Abbot of this house, in the raigne of Henry the sixt, a man much renowned for his due desert of learning, for his god∣ly life and conuersation, for his pleasant disposition, and for the charges he was at, and the meanes he made, to adorne and enrich his Church and mo∣nastery. Out of a Manuscript in Sir Robert Cot ons rich Librarie, intituled, Gesta paucula Abbatis Iohannis Sexti, I collected thus much of his particu∣lar actions. Iohn, the sixt Abbot of this house, of that christian name, that he might outwardly shew, saith the booke, how inwardly hee loued the beautie of the house of God, and how much he desired to decke and embellish the ha∣bitation of the most holy; first hee caused our Ladies chappell to bee new trimmed, and curiously depicted, with stories out of the sacred word: vp∣on the south side whereof, these verses were curiously depensed in gold. Dulce pluit Manna partum dum protulit Anna, Dulcius ancilla dum Christus creuit in illa. Vpon the north side these. Flos Campi dicta tibi questio ...... puella Floris habens picta venerari fronde capella. In the roofe about the picture of the Lambe. Inter oues Aries regat vt sine cornibus agnus: Vnder the picture of the Eagle. Inter aues Aquila veluti sine felle columba. He built a little Chappell in the south part of the Church for his owne buriall place, in which vnder certaine pictures in the windowes, he caused these verses to be inscribed. Propicij Patres, compassiue quoque matres Orat, vt oretis, sua quod sit pausa quietis Vester adoptatus hic filius intumulatus. The north part of his Church being somewhat darke, hee caused new windowes to be made, and glazed, to make it appeare more light and glo∣rious; and in the glasse, vnder the images of certaine heathen Philosophers, which had testified of the incarnation of Iesus Christ; these Hexameters were inscribed. Istac qui graderis hos testes si memoreris: Credere vim poteris proles Deus est mulieris. Vnder the picture of Ioseph of Arimathia in another window. Ad Britones ivi postquam Christum sepeliui, Glasconiam veni, Britones docui, requieui. Vnder the pictures of the foure Doctors of the Church. Bina per hec paria fidei quod gignit alumpna Firma stat Ecclesia, quadra fulcita columpna. And that he might further illuminate his Church, he caused a faire large window to be made anew in the West end of the said North Isle. Vpon the erection of which these rimes were composed. In patria boree quo plus durabilis in se, Fertur petra fore factor fuit ipse fenestre, Que nunc erigitur in ea quoque parte locatur; Totius Ecclesie que fertur clarior esse, Eius & occiduam bene ditat lumine finem. He made a reuerend kinde of imbroidered vesture, for himselfe and his suc∣cessours, to vse when they were to enter into their Sanctum Sanctorum: he made a new Miter, and a Pastorall staffe. Vpon which this metre was carued. Postquam sex annis benedixit dextra Iohannis Wethamsted, pepulum fecerat hunc baculum. For the vse and honour of the holy Altar, he made a Chalice of pure gold, a paire of siluer censers; a paire of siluer Basons gilt. Vpon which were en∣grauen the similitudes of a Lambe and an Eagle, with these riming verses. Peluis post latices vt lota manus veniales Conficiat calices: prius annuat Agnus & Ales. Vpon the pictures of Christ, the blessed Virgine, Saint Alban, and the sacred Host, as they were to be carried in the Cloister, or into the Towne; he caused diuers verses to be written, to bring the people into a reuerend re∣gard of the same. Vt Iesus & mater, noster simul Prothomartyr Acetu populi deberent plus venerari. Instituit, varia quibus & veneratio dicta Creuit, & Ecclesie cultus fuit amplior in se. Of all his pious acts which he performed for the ornament of his Church, thus much is written (briefly) in the same booke. In cappis, casulis, Albis, simul & tunicellis, Inque bonis alijs varijs magis ac preciosis; Precessit patres pater hic cunctos preeuntes. Plus coluit que Deum, cur recolamus eum. In like manner hee trimmed vp his Monasterie, with curious painted imageries and diuers inscriptions in golden letters. In his owne lodgings. Dote licet multa tua sit species bene culta, Mos nisi nubat ei dos simplicis est speciei. Ortus magnorum quamuis sis stirpe deorum; Iunge tibi morem facis ortum nobiliorem. Inter eos quos fama deos in honore leuavit; Sors famulos, mors discipulos in sine probauit. In the walke betwixt the Hall and the Abbots Chamber: Hec in regnante duo sunt contraria valde, Sedis apex primus, probitatis spiritus ymus. Sis Dux munificus, sis prudens, sisque benignus, Tresque Duces simul es Eneas, Titus, Vlixes. Non bene concessum princeps regit ille Ducatum, Concilio procerum qui non regitur sapientum. Iudex quando sedes caneas ne iura supines Iure quidem tradito. Plebs Rex est, Rex sine regno? In the windowes of the Abbots Studie, or Librarie. Cum studeas, videas, vt sit virtus & honestas; Hic & vbique tibi finalis causa studendi. Hec loca sceptrigere pudeat sacrate Sophie Hoc ad opus trahere quod mandat Martha Marie. Huius amore loci regimen postponere noli. Quo minor esca gregi detur magis esurienti. In the Chamber adioyning to his Studie. Condere ne timeas quicquid persuadet honestas: Gratia propositis semper respondet honestis. He gaue a great Bason of siluer double gilt, to the Monasterie, which hee thus engraued about the Verge. Dic quisquis fueris bene domi si memoreris Quis fueratque dator, nunqui suus esse precator, Siue prees ve subes, propter donum tenearis. Si ic hortor te pro donatore precare; Dicque perhennis e sit lux que locus requie . In a Chappell which he built for the Couent, these verses. Turma senectutis, plebs egra, cohorsque salutis In vestris precibus Are sacra cum celebratis; Hanc propter fabricam sextum memorate Iohannem. After this manner did he adorne, new build, and enrich both his Church and Abbey; and in all his new buildings or repairings, hee caused the pi∣ctures of a Lambe and an Eagle to be thereupon drawne or depicted with these verses following; which you may reade vpon the roofe or top of the Quire in the Abbey Church at this day. Dic vbicunque vides sit pictus vt Agnus & Ales Effigies operis, sexti sunt ista Iohannis Parte vel in toto in visse, vel in faciendo Est opus hoc vnum causauit eum faciendum. He built much at his Mannor of Titten-Hanger not farre from hence, and in his Studie there inscribed these verses. Ipse Iohannis amor Whethamslede vbique proclamor, Eius & alter honor hic lucis in ange reponor. In a Chappell there which he much enlarged, he caused to be painted vpon the walls the similitudes of all the Saints of his owne Christian name of Iohn: with his owne picture, which seemingly thus prayeth. Cum fero par nomen, par ferre precor simul omen; Tum paribus que pari, licet impar, luce locari. He repaired or rather built anew the Church of Redburne, and consecrated the altar againe: ouer which these verses were written vpon the wall. M. semel x. terno C quater quoque querno Ara resecrata, domus hec varijsque nouata. Vpon the couering or roofe ouer the Chancell, vnder the pictures of the Lambe and Eagle, these. Ecce pecus mundi to lens peccata rotundi. En et auis, celi reserans arcana fideli. En pecus en et auis, opus en sextique Iohannis. He built a Librarie in the Monkes Colledge in Oxford, to which he gaue many bookes, in some of which he writ these verses. Fratribus Oxonie datur in munus liber iste. Per patrem pecorum Prothomartyris Angligenorum. Quem siquis rapiat ad partem siue reponat. Vel Iude laqueum, vel furcas sentiat Amen. In other of the bookes which he gaue to the said Librarie, these. Discior vt docti fieret noua regia plebi Culta magisque Dee datur hic liber ara Minerue, His qui dijs dictis libant holocausta ministris. Et Cirre bibulam sitiunt pre Nectare lympham, Estque librique loci, idem dator, actor et vnus. He built also a Chappell adioyning to the Librarie, and in the principall window vnder the pictures of the Crucifix, the Virgine Mary, and Saint Iohn Baptist, he caused these deprecatory times to be put in the glasse. Mors medicina necis; via vite, pax populatus, Sis spes prompta precis, lex cure, laus Monachatus. Ma ris mesticia, mors prolis, vulnera quina, Sint m a leticia fati pulsante ruina. Virginis imbutor, fidei fortiss me tutor, Nominis vt reputor seror omnis oro secutor. He bestowed great charges vpon the Abbots lodging-house in London. By his wisedome he did so mediate with Vmfrey, Duke of Glocester, that he g ue to this Church ( ornatus vestimentorum ) a suite of vestments worth three thousand markes; with the Mannour of Pembroke in South Wales, for that the Monkes should pray for his soule; and chose this Church for the place of his buriall. Vpon which, these rimes. Vltraiam dicta, que sunt numero satis ampla, Diues item cella Penbrok à plebe vocata: Per patris media fuit Ecclesie propriata; Ossa tegique sua legit, Propriator, in ipsa. He gaue much to the Churches of Winslow and Newenham, and other Churches in London. He gaue a challice of pure gold and of great waight to the Priory of Tinmouth, where he was brought vp as a Scholler, a Chal∣lice to Wallingford, another to the Church of Worcester. An estimate of his charitable and pious deuotions to this and other Churches, you may see in these two lines, beside what money and goods he bequeathed vpon his death-bed. Summa prius dicta si sit sine fraude quotata Bister millenas fertur transcendere libras. And, preter gesta iam dicta, saith the booke, fecit Abbas prefatus multa alia opera bona que non scripta in libro hoc. Hec antem scripta sunt vt glori∣ficetur deus in omnibus, qui dedit servulo suo gratiam ad peragendum hec paucula in diebus suis. Et vt ea legant Fratres, atque legentes, vt ardentio∣r m habeant appetitum ad orandum in specie pro anima eius. He was a generall good scholler; some fourescore and odde seuerall Trea∣tises are set downe in this booke of Saint Albons, written by this Abbot. Be∣fore the names whereof these verses. Nomina librorum cum contentis & eorum Quos frumentalis domino pressante, Iohannes Fecit vel scribi, fieri vel, vel renouaui. Hic subscribuntur mentaliter vt teneantur. He gaue ouer his charge for a time, and vndertooke it againe a little be∣fore his death, which happened in the raigne of Edward the fourth. He was buried in his owne Chappell which he had prouided in his life time. To whose memory this Epitaph was made by one of the Monkes. Contegit iste lapis venerabilis ossa Iohannis Epit.

This Towne vaunts her selfe very much of the birth and buriall of Sir Iohn Mandeuill Knight, Sir Iohn Man∣deuill knight. the famous Trauailer, who writ in Latine, French, and in the English tongue, his Itinerary of three and thirty yeares. And that you may beleeue the report of the Inhabitants to bee true, they haue lately pensild a rare piece of Poetry, or an Epitaph for him, vpon a piller; neere to which, they suppose his body to haue beene buried, which I thinke not much amisse to set downe; for although it will not bee worth the reading, yet doe but set it to some lofty tune, as to the Hunting of An¦tichrist, or the like, I know it will be well worth the singing: marke how it runs. All yee that passe, on this pillar cast eye, This Epitaph read if you can; 'Twill tell you a Tombe on 't stood in this roome, Of a braue spirited man. Iohn Mandeuill by name, a knight of great fame, Borne in this honoured Towne. Before him was none that euer was knowne, For trauaile of so high renowne. As the Knights in the Temple, crosse-legged in marble, In armour, with sword and with sheeld, So was this Knight grac't, which time hath defac't, That nothing but ruines doth yeeld. His Trauailes being donne, he shines like the Sun, In heauenly Canaan. To which blessed place, O Lord of his grace, Bring vs all man after man. That he was borne here in this Towne I cannot much deny; but I am sure that within these few yeares, I saw his Tombe in the Citie of Leege, with∣in the Church of the religious house of the Guilliammits, with this Inscrip∣tion vpon it, and the verses following hanging by on a table.

In this Abbey Church is a goodly Font of solid brasse, wherein the kings children of Scotland were wont to be baptized; which Font Sir Ri∣chard Lea knight, Master of the Pioners, brought as a spoile out of the Scottish warres, and gaue it to this Church. As may appeare by this loftie and arrogant inscription about the same; as if the Font in it owne person did proclaime the knights act to all passengers in these words, lately Eng∣lished. When Leeth a Towne of good account among the Scots, and Edin∣brough their chiefe Citie were on a fire, Sir Richard Lea knight, saued mee from burning, and brought mee into England. And I being mindfull of this so great a benefit, whereas before I was wont to serue for baptizing of none but Kings children, haue now willingly offered my seruice euen to the mea∣nest of the English Nation. Lea the Victour would haue it so. Farewell. In the yeare of our Lord, M.D.xliii. and of the raigne of King Henry the eight xxxvi. These already written are all the Epitaphs or inscriptions which I finde in this Abbey Church: howsoeuer it doth retaine the ashes of many a wor∣thie man conquered by death, Egfrid king of the Mercians. both before and since the Conquest▪ As of Egfrid king of the Mercians, sonne to great Offa the Founder, who added to those twenty Lordships or Mannors, wherewith his father at the first endowed this foundation: Ex Reg dea r.

The first businesse that this King vndertooke after hee came to the Crowne, was the restauration of ancient priuiledges to the Church, and great hope was conceiued of his further proceedings, had not God cut him off by vntimely death, the 17. day of September, in the yeare of our Lord God, 796. and in the first of his raigne hauing had neither wife nor issue. His bodie with all due obsequies was here Princely interred neare to the Shrine of S. Alban. Rob. Mowbray Earle of Nor∣thumberland, a Monke.

This Robert Mowbray, a most valiant Souldier, seeing his countrey de∣stroyed, and ouerrunne euen vnto Alnewicke castle, by Malcolme King of Scotland and his armie, made head against the said Malcolme (not staying for directions from his King William Rufus ) and so sore and suddenly di∣stressed his forces, that both king Malcolme himselfe, and his sonne Prince Edward were there slaine. Mat. Paris. Hereupon this Earle growing proud, and greatly suspected by King Wil∣liam, began to fortifie the Kings Castles, with munition for Armes against the like inuasion, Speed ca . and indeed against the Kings will; who sent him word somewhat roughly, to desist from his doings, and presently to repaire to his presence; which whilest he lingered and neglected to do, king William sent his brother Henry to spoile Northumberland, and immediately followed after himselfe, where without much adoe, he tooke the Earle, and commit∣ted him prisoner to Windsor Castle.

This Robert Mowbray and William of Anco, with others, conspired to depriue the King both of Crowne and life, and to haue set vp Stephen de Albamarle his Aunts sonne, as Houeden and Walsingham will haue it. But I reade in an old Manuscript that he fauouring the proceedings of Anselme, Ex lib. Ab. de Newburgh. in bib. Cott. Archbishop of Canterbury, Pro amore & bono Ecclesie innocentem vitam finiebat. Cuius anime propitietur Deus. As the words are.

Whose Lands in Normandy, as also, for the most part, here in England, the said King Henry gaue to Nigell de Albeney, viro probo et illustri. Ordorus vitatis. lib. 7. pa. 649. Another writer tells vs, that he married Maud, the daughter of Riche∣rius de Aquila, a potent man in the Conquerours dayes, and that after foure and thirtie yeares of imprisonment, hee died without issue: in these words. Mathildis autem potenti viro Roberto de Molbraio Comiti Norbandum▪ brorum nupsit, qui eodem anno contra Willielmum Rufum Regem Anglorum rebellauit. Sed paulo post captus, fere 34. annis in carcere praefati Regis, & Henrici fratris eius sine prole consenuit. The same Author deliuers his marriage thus in another place. Lib. 8. pa. 703.

And in the said page, he sets downe his character, and the number of the Lordships which he possest here in England, with his great power and riches, thus. Robertus Rogerij de Molbraio filius potentia diuitijsque admodum polle∣bat; audacia et militari feritate superbus pares despiciebat, & superioribus obtemperare, vana ventositate turgidus, indignum autumabat.

Hic ni∣mirum cclxxx. villas in Anglia possidebat. This man of this high spirit and ample possessions, became in the end to bee a shorne Monke of this Monastery, as you may reade in the Cata∣logues of Honour; wherein hee died, Ann. 1106. To whose memory a Monke of his order made this Epitaph. Which he caused to be engrauen vpon his Monument, vpon the North side of the Vestrie where he was in∣terred.

Pax sit eique mihi. Amen. Here sometimes was interred the bodie of Alexander Necham, Alex. Necham. whose knowledge in good Arts made him famous throughout England, France, Italie, yea and the whole world; and that with such incredible admiration, that he was called Miraculum ingenij, the wonder and miracle of wit and sapience. He was an exact Philosopher, an excellent Diuine, an accurate Rhetorician, and an admirable Poet. As did appeare by many his writings which he left to posteritie: Cent. 2. some of which are mentioned by Bale. He was borne in this Towne, Camd. in Hert. as appeares by a certaine passage in one of his Latine Poems, cited by Camden, and thus englished by his Translator Doctor Holland. This is the place that knowledge tooke of my natiuitie, My happie yeares, my dayes also of mirth and iollitie. This place my childhood trained vp in all Arts liberall, And laid the groundworke of my name, and skill Poeticall. This place great and renowned Clerkes into the world hath sent: For Martyr blest, for nation, for site, all excellent. A troupe here of religious men serue Christ both night and day, In holy warfare taking paines, duly to watch and pray. Camden in his Allusions to names, tells vs that he, being desirous to en∣ter into religion in this house, after he had signified his desire, writ thus to the Abbot Laconically. Si vis, veniam, sin autem, tu autem. Who answered as briefly, alluding to his name: thus. Si bonus sis, venias, si nequam, nequaquam. Whereupon, saith he, he changed his name to Neckam. A Monke of this house made this Hexamiter allusiuely to his name. Dictus erat Nequam, vitam duxit tamen equam. He is thought, by some, saith Bale, to haue beene a Canon Regular, and to haue beene preferred to the Abbotship of Glocester: as another in this old language will haue it. Glocest. And master Alisander that Chanon was er I maked was of Gloucestre Abbot thulk yer. viz. 7. Reg. Regis Iohannis. But this may be vnderstood of Alexander Theologus, of whom I haue spoken elsewhere, who was contemporarie with him: for I finde that this Alexander was Abbot of Saint Maries in Circester, or Cirencester.

Now if you be desirous further to know how this Abbey Church hath beene honoured by the Sepultures of many worthy persons; will it please you peruse these verses following, by which, both her foundation and fall is plainly deciphered. Behold that goodly Fane which ruin'd now doth stand, . Drayton Poly . Song 16 To holy Albon built, first Martyr of this Land, Who in the faith of Christ from Rome to Britaine came, And dying in this place resign'd his glorious name. In memory of whom (as more then halfe Diuine) Our English Offa rear'd a rich and sumptuous Shrine; And Monastery here: which our succeeding Kings, From time to time endow'd with many goodly things. And many a Christian Knight was buried here, before The Norman set his foot vpon this conquered shore; And after those braue spirits in all those balefull stowers, That with Duke Robert went against the Pagan powers. And in their countries right, as Cressy those that stood, And that at Poyters bath'd their bilbowes in French blood; Their valiant Nephewes next at Agincourt that fought, Whereas rebellious France vpon her knees was brought. In this religious house at some of their returnes, When nature claim'd her due, here plac't their hallowed vrnes: Which now deuouring Time, in his so mighty waste, Demollishing those walls, hath vtterly defac't. So that the earth to feele the ruinous heapes of stones, That with the burth'nous weight now presse their sacred bones, Forbids this wicked brood, should by her fruits be fed; As loathing her owne wombe, that such loose children bred. But I will come to the quarrell of the houses of Yorke and Lancaster, which filled vp our Ladies Chappell here, with the dead bodies of the No∣bilitie, slaine in and about this Towne of Saint Albans ; whose funerall Tro∣phies are wasted with deuouring time, and seates or Pewes for the Townes∣men made ouer their honorable remaines. Of these Lords here buried, thus writeth the old Poet, Iohn Gower. Quos mors, quos Martis sors saeua, suaeque sororis Bella prostrarunt, villae medioque necarunt, Mors sic occīsos tumulauerat hic simul ipsos, Postque necem requiem causauit habere perennem Et medium sine quo vult hic requiescere nemo; Hic lis, hic pugna, mors est qui terminat arma, Mors, sors, & Mauors qui strauerunt Dominos hos. But amongst so many of the Nobilitie here interred, I finde few remem∣bred, saue Edmund Duke of Somerset, Henry Earle of Northumberland, and Iohn the valiant old Lord Clifford. The death of this Edmund Duke of Somerset, Edmund Duke of Somerset. grandchilde to Iohn of Gaunt, sore grieued King Henry the sixth; because in him he had alwayes put great trust and confidence: being a chiefe Commander, and one who had long gouerned Normandy, beene Regent of France, and for his coun∣tries sake had alwayes right valiantly borne himselfe against the French. Yet his actions, whatsoeuer they were, did not please the common people; nor many other of ranke and qualitie in those times. For Harding who liued in those dayes, thus writ of him. Thei slewe the Duke Edmond, Hard. ca. 234. then of Somerset, For cause he had the realmes wele so lette. He was slaine vnder the signe of the Castle in the Towne, being long before warned (as it is reported) to auoide all Castles. Henry Lord Percy, Henry Earle of Northumber∣land. Earle of Northumberland aforesaid, was the sonne of Henry, surnamed Hot-spurr, slaine at the battell of Shrewsbury by King Henry the fourth. But his fathers offence, and his Grandfathers, being for∣giuen him, he was restored to his Grandfathers dignities by Henry the fifth, to whom, and to his sonne Henry the sixth, he euer continued a loyall sub∣iect, stoutly maintaining their right to the Crowne of England; in which quarrell he here lost his life. The old Lord Clifford here interred, is specially remembred in the bat∣tell, for so valiantly defending and strongly keeping the Barre-yates and entrance in the Towne; insomuch that the Duke of Yorke had euer the repulse, vntill great Warwicke brake in by a garden side, with a noise of Trumpets and voices, crying, A Warwicke, a Warwicke. Whereupon en∣sued that fierce and cruell battel in which this valourous old Lord manfully lost his life. Of these two last remembred, will you reade this Stanza. Therle then of Northumberland was there Of sodein chaunce drawen furth by the kyng And slain vnknowne by any manne ther were The Lord Clifford ouer busie in werking At the Barres them mette sore fightyng Was slain that day vpon his owne assaute As eche manne saied, it was his owne defaute. This battell wherein they were slaine, was the first battell at Saint Albans, which was fought in the yeare 1455. the Thursday before Pentecost. Iohn Whethamsted, the fore remembred Abbot, made certaine Epi∣taphs for religious persons, and others here interred; as also in other Chur∣ches hereabouts. Which for the most part are now either taken away by time, or stolne away with the brasse from their Graue-stones; which, how∣soeuer I know not well how to appropriate to the Persons for whom they were intended. Yet it will not be lost labour to take and imprint them out of the Manuscript, for that the Reader may see the rare compositions in that age. 1. Duplex est vita, duplex mors, corporis vna; Nominis astch altra, miserorum mors ea dicta. Non sic hic obijt, non sic hic nunc requiescit, mo mors prima fuit illi vita secunda. Et si quod rapere voluit mors id tribuisse Fertur, quasque dare tenebras has surripuisse Estque lucet sic ei lux perpetue requiei. Atque libro vite quo nunc inscribitur ipse, Nomen eius legitur & cum sanctis numeratur. 2. Vpon a Prior of this house here buried, who was neuer beloued in his life time, yet much bewailed after his death. Quem dens momordit liuoris dummodo vixit, Linguaque detraxit, mors nunc bene glorificauit. Nunc redeunt varia tumulata prius benefacta; Famaque recrescit, liuor post facta quiescit. Nunc acus invidie, lingue fel, serra loquele, Carpere cessarunt: nunc aicere sic didicerunt. Quando cadens obijt abijt pater hicque recessit; Secum dapsilitas secum virtus & honestas. Istius Ecclesie quasi plangentes abiere. Secum claustrale frenum que iugum Monachale Migrarunt eciam; claustro dederantque salutem. Secum vera fides, bine secumque sorores, Ibant ad puteum, dixere, locoque tuantem Secum fertilitas, pietas, secumque facultas, Que parcit miseris, sua que confert & egenis: Secum Iusticia, pax, & lex, & policia. In breuibus quicquia virtutem gignere possit, Secum transiuit, abijt, secumque recessit Cur Dominus secum, secum requies in idipsum. 3. Vpon a Monke buried in this Church. Alter honestatis Sol serens & grauitatis, Hesperus ac morum, lampas rutilans monachorum, Nunc occultatur; hic sub modio tenebratur. Nec tribuit lumen Claustro quod tribuit olim; Mors eclipsari cansauerat & tenebrari: Est tamen Eclipsis hee eius particularis. Nam sua seu prima nunc vita latet tenebrata, Altera sic lucet, sic nomen eique resplendet, Quod per defectum nunquam patietur Eclipsim: Nam per vim fame stat mortis vulnus inane; Cur exoretur pro Patre pioque rogetur, Lux quia vera fuit subiectis dummodo rexit Semper perpes ei lux luceat, ac requici. Pausa sit perpetue, vita vinat duplicique, Nominis, ac anime, sic vinere vult meruitque. 4. Vpon a Monke of this Abbey here entombed. Quem Natura mirum natu fecit generosum, Grataque sors Dominum, mos atque patrem Monachorum, Nunc abijt, sed non obijt, quia nomine viuit Nec recubat, magis astch vigilat, quia fama superstes, Vestitu Maurus, fuit, in victu Benedictus, Pacomius monitis, Basilius & rudimentis: Nec sibi defuerat ipsum decuit quod habere, Impar nam steterat, & Pater absque pare. Pro Pastore pecus, plebs pro domino gemit omnis, Almaque Sponsa flet cecidisse virum. Astra tamen ciuem letentur habere perhennem, Exultatque Polus quod sit ei thalamus. 5. Vpon a Monke of this house here buried. Qui lacrimans Lazarum revocasti quadraduanum, Ad vitam Monachum reuoces sic hic tumulatum. Fac tecumque frui requie cum luce perhenni: Vendicat ex iure, vixit Monachaliter ipse. 6. Vpon another Brother of the Couent here interred. Iste Pater, pater iste, pius, Pater hic tumulatus; Et pater, & mater, Pedagogus eratque minister Dum rexit, pecorum fuerat, cur quod tribuendum, Quatuor hijs restat, nunc detur, eique reviuat, In voto Fratrum quia tot fuit vnus eisdem. Stoque vices que modos alternauit variantes Morte premi talem culpat pietas pietatem. 7. Vpon Iohn Cressy a young youth, of the ancient familie of the Cressyes, hereby at Harding. Dum puer ipse fui, puer & libroque vacaui, Mortis mole rui, moriens hic me sepeliui. Heres magnus eram, preclara stirpe que natus; Dumque superfueram Iohn Cressy rite vocatus. Qui pretergrederis lege; pro me postque preceris. 8. Vpon another young boy, where buried I know not. Que iuuenes que senes, pueros, que viros premit omnes Mors sub mole tua, precor, in te, voce sub ista Sit tibi posse breue; nunquam fatum puerile Per te mutetur, sit canus cum morietur. Vi vndennis eram morsu cum mortis obibam. 9. Dum mater plorat, puer hic in morte laborat; Dumque Petra tegitur rogat vt requies sibi detur. Vt rogat ipsae sibi sit perpes pax requiei. Sic nos clamemus, secum pariterque rogemus, Vt sibi cum requie lux lucescat sine fine. 10. Vpon Thomas Pakington slaine in the first battell, here in Saint Albans, who was Sword-bearer to Henry Lord Percy, Earle of Northumberland, here also slaine, as I haue said before. He lies buried in Saint Peters Church in this Towne, with an Epitaph vpon a marble-stone, to the same effect. Me vis prostrauit, me post mortem tumulauit; Hac sub mole petre; perij, seu sic periere Tres magni Domini; fueram tunc scutifer vni Portitor ac gladij: pax sit eique mihi. Ipse Thomas dictus Pakington eramque vocatus. 11. Vpon Margaret Biseworth a Maide. Qui legis hec memora iacet hic quod femina clara, Que Margareta fuerat Byesworth vocitata. Hanc mors seua nimis, etas sibi dum iuuenilis Infuit, intacto steterat dum corpore Virgo, Peste sua strauit hic stratam & tumulauit. M. semel: x querno: C quater, ter & I. sibi iuncto V. que, die binamartis decies repetita Transijt à seculo sibi propicius Deus esto. 12. Vpon Iohn Dunstable an Astrologian, a Mathematician, a Musitian, and what not. Musicus hic Michalus alter, nouus & Ptholomeus, Iunior ac Athlas supportans robore celos, Pausat sub cinere; melior vir de muliere Nunquam natus erat; vicij quia labe carebat. Et virtutis opes possedit vnicus omnes. Cur exoptetur, sic optandoque precetur Perpetuijs annis celebretur fama Iohannis Dunstapil; in pace requiescat & hic sine fine. 13. Vpon one Peter, buried in the lower part of this Quire. Petrum petra tegit; qui post obitum sibi legit Hic in fine chori se sub tellure reponi. Petra fuit Petrus petree quia condicionis; Substans & solidus quasi postis relligionis. Hic sibi sub Petra sit pax & pausa quieta. 14. Vpon one Peter Iones, a Doctor, and a Parson, a confabulatorie Epitaph. Quis iacet hic? Pastor: quis item? graduamine Doctor: Quod nomen? Petrus: cognomen quale? Iohannes: Annis quot rexit? ter trinis: quot sibi vixit? Lustra bis septem: Quis finis? sanctus eidem: Vixit enim sancte, moriens sic desijt atque. 15. Hic soboles cineris, hic proles & mulieris Compausant; vtero pariendi rursus ab vno. Partu puluereo renouatur vitae secundo Et sub perpetuo mors manet exilio. In this Manuscript are diuers other Epitaphs of his making, which I shall meete withall by the way. I had like to haue forgotten Alan Strayler, Alan Strayler. the Painter or Limmer out of the pictures, in the golden Register, of all the Benefactours to this Ab∣bey; who for such his paines (howsoeuer he was well payed) and for that he forgaue three shillings foure pence of an old debt owing vnto him for colours; is thus remembred. Nomen Pictoris Alanus Strayler habetur Qui sine fine choris celeslibus associetur. But it is high time to take leaue of the Abbey, which at the first (as you may perceiue by the premisses) was endowed with much land, and many large priuiledges, and daily augmented, and successiuely confirmed by the charters of many of our English and Saxon Kings and Princes; and much enlarged in all by sundrie Abbots, and other sincere well-affected persons. So that before the dissolution such were the priuiledges of this place, that the King could make no secular Officer ouer them but by their owne con∣sent they were alone quite from paying that Apostolicall custome and , which was called Rom-scot or Peter-pence: whereas neither King, Arch ishop, Bishop, Abbot, Prior, nor any one in the kingdome was freed from the payment thereof. The Abbot also (or Monke appointed Arch∣de con vnder him) had pontificall iurisdiction ouer the Priests and Lay∣men, of all the possessions belonging to this Church, so as he yeelded sub∣ tion to no Archbishop, Bishop, or Legate, saue onely to the Pope of . This Abbot had the fourth place among the Abbots, which sate as ons in the Parliament house. Howsoeuer Pope Adrian the fourth, hose surname was Breakespeare, borne hereby at Abbots Langley, grant∣ d this indulgence to the Abbots of this Monasterie; that as Saint Alban was distinctly knowne to be the first Martyr of the English Nation: so the bbot of his Monasterie should at all times among other Abbots of Eng∣ nd, in degree of dignitie, be reputed first and principall. The Abbot and of this house were acquitted of all Toll through England. They made Iustices, ad audiendum & terminandum, within themselues; and no other Iustice could call them for any matter out of their libertie. They made Bayliffes and Coroners: They had the execution, and returne of all Writs, goods of all out-lawes, with Gaole and Gaole deliuerie within them∣selues. And receiued to their owne proper vse the Rom-scot (before spoken of) throughout all the County of Hertford. This Abbey was surrendred vp by the Abbot and Monkes there; by deliuering the Couent seale into the hands of . Pope: D. Peter: Master Cauendish, and other the Kings visitors, the fifth day of December, 1539. It was valued, at a farre vnder ate, to bee worth of yearely reuenue, two thousand fiue hundred and ten pound, sixe shillings, penny halfe penny, q: Saint Peters Church in Saint Albans. This Church and Churchyard was stuft full with the bodies of such as were slaine in the two battells, fought here at Saint Albans. In which I finde a funerall Monument for my valiant countreyman, Sir Bertin Entwi∣sell, who fighting on the Kings partie, died of a wound receiued in the first battell. Vpon whose Tombe this Inscription, inlayd in brasse, is yet to be read. Here lyth Syr Bertin Entwisel knyght, which was borne in Lancaster Shyre, and was Vicound and Baron of Brykbeke in Normandy, and Baliffe of Constantin. Who died the xxviii of May, M.cccc.lv. on whos sowl Iesu have mercy. Of which Sir Bertin, thus speaketh Leland in his Commentaries. Ther is a Viscownt of Brykbek in Normandy, saith he, callyd Bertyne, or Ber∣frame Cnitwesell, that cam into England, and was much on the factyon of kyng Henry the sixth, and slayn at on of the Battels at Saint Albons, and beryed in the Peroche Chyrch of Seynt Peter, vnder the plase of the Lecto∣rium in the Quyre, wheras a memoriall of hym ther yet remeyneth. Ther was a dawghter of this Viscount callyd Lucy, of whom Master Bradene of Northamptonshyre is descendyd; and in the same Shyre is a mean gentyl∣man of that name▪ These Entwisells were gentlemen of good respect in our countrey in our fathers dayes, whose mansion house retaines the name of Entwisell to this houre: The last heire of which house (as I haue it out of the collections of M. Dalton, alias Norroy king of Armes) was one Wilfred Entwisell, who sold the land that was left him, and serued as a Lance at Muselborrow∣field, in the second yeare of the raigne of king Edward the sixth; after that he serued the Guyes in defence of Meth. After that he was one of the foure Captaines of the Fort of Newhauen; where being infected with the plague, and shipped for England, was landed about Portsmouth, and being vncer∣taine of any house, died vnder a hedge, in September, Ann. 1549. Raph Bapthorpe the father, Raphe Babthorpe and Raphe his soone. and Raphe the sonne, of Bapthorpe in the East∣riding of Yorkeshire; which for many descents hath yeelded both name and habitation to that knightly familie; fighting in this Towne vnder the banner of King Henry the sixth, lost their liues, and here lye buried toge∣ther; with this Epitaph. Cum Patre Radulpho Babthorp iacet ecce Radulphus Filius, bot duro marmore pressus humo. Henrici sexti Dapifer, Pater Armiger eius, Mors satis id docuit, fidus vterque fuit. C. Domini quater M. semel.

Behold where two Raulph Babthorps, both the sonne and father lie, Vnder a stone of marble hard, interr'd in this mould drie: To Henry sixth the Father Squire, the sonne he Sewer was, Both true to Prince, and for his sake they both their life did passe. The yeare one thousand and foure hundred fiftie five, Grimme death, yet not alone, did them of breath depriue.

About the yeare of the worlds redemption, Camd. in . 429. when as the Pelagian heresie budded forth afresh in this Island, and so polluted the British Chur∣ches, as that to auerre and maintaine the truth, they sent for German, Bi∣shop of Auxerre, the place of his birth (a man of moche noble lygnage, taught and enformed wel in the Artes liberalle, lerned in the scyence of the Decretees droytes and lawe, Iac. de voragine in vit. S. Ger. saith his Legend) and Lupus Bishop of Troies out of France: who by refuting this heresie, gained vnto themselues a re∣uerent account among the Britains. but chiefly German, who hath at this day thorowout all this Island many Churches dedicated to his memorie. Now, vnderstand, that neere to the walls of the old Citie Verulam, was, as then, a plot of consecrated ground, wherein the bodies of such as had professed Christianitie, and suffered martyrdome vnder the persecution of the Romane Emperours, S. Germans th buria l many . were interred. In which the said German openly (out of the pulpit) preached Gods word to the people; where afterwards the beleeuing Christians built this Chappell, and dedicated it to his ho∣nour; for that by his doctrine, and other good meanes, hee had conuerted many thousands to the true profession of Christian Religion. This German commanded the Sepulchre of Saint Alban to be opened, and therein be∣stowed certaine reliques of Saints, that those whom one heauen had recei∣ued, should also be in one Sepulchre together lodged. Camd. in Thus much (saith Camden ) I note by the way, that ye may obserue and consider the fashions of that age. This Chappell, or rather the ruines of it, are remaining at this day, and put to a prophane and beastly vse. The foundations of Sopwell, S. Iulians, and Saint Mary Pree. About this Towne of Saint Albons, the Abbots of the Monasterie in a pious and deuout intent erected a little Nunnery at Sopwell, valued but at threescore and eight pound eight shillings, per annum. Saint Iulians Spittle for Lepers, and another named Saint Mary de Pree, or Saint Mary in the Medow, Ger mbery. for diseased weemen. Neere vnto which they had a great Mannour, named Gorombery : where Sir Nicholas Bacon knight, Lord Keeper of the great Seale of England, a man of rare wit and deepe experience (father of Sir Francis Bacon knight, Lord Verulam, Viscount Saint Al an, Lord Chancellour of England, lately deceased, one that might iustly challenge, as his due, all the best attributes of learning) built an house beseeming his place and calling; and ouer the entrance into the Hall caused these verses to be engrauen. Haec cum perfecit Nicholaus tecta Baconus Inscriptions. Elisabeth regni lustra fuere duo. Factus Eques magni custos fuit ipse sigilli: Gloria sit soli tota tributa Deo. Mediocria firma. Vpon the frontispice of a gate, entring into an Orchard with a garden and a wildernesse, ouer the statue of Orpheus, these verses are depicted. Horrida nuper eram aspectu latebraeque ferarum, Ruricolis tantum numinibusque locus.

For, to escape the execution of the Edict of the Emperour, hee fled from Verulam (with a great number of such as he had conuerted) into the kingdome of Scotland, and into the Isle of Anglesey in Wales; whereof hee was made Bishop, preaching in all places the true and liuely word, disputing and writing against the worship∣pers of false Gods. But being afterwards apprehended, he was brought to the same place where his Scholler Saint Alban suffered martyrdome, and whipped about a stake, whereat his intrailes were tied: so winding his bo∣wels out of his body, was lastly stoned to death, like another Stephen. For whose body some of the persecuted Christians got a stolne buriall here at Redborne; from whence it was remoued with all celebritie, and enshrined by the reliques of (his Scholler) Saint Alban ; in the yeare of Grace 1178. the 25. day of Iune. Nullum vnquam tam iucundum tam salutarem diem videt Verulamium (saith Harpsfeeld ) occurrebat enim Martyr martyri, Magistro discipulus, hospes H. spiti, & caelestis cruis conciuicaelesti. The Co∣uent of Saint Albans had such a care that his reliques should bee deuoutly preserued, that a decree was made by Thomas then Abbot; that a Prior and three Monkes should be appointed for so sacred an office; for which they were to receiue twenty pounds yearely allowance. Such was the price and estimation in those dayes, of the bones and ashes of religious persons, re∣markable for their holinesse. Cent. 1. This Amphibalus was a rare Linguist, and a profound Diuine for those times. He writ a booke against the errours of the Gentiles, and certaine Homilies vpon the foure Euangelists, with other learned works mentioned by Bale. Sir Richard Read knight, lieth here entombed.

Neare to this Village sometime was a little religious house of Nunnes, of which I neuer read nor heard further, then by an old petition in rime, which runnes by tradition from one traueller to another, as they passe along this thorrow fare.

Here are in this Church three wondrous ancient Monuments, whose inscriptions are quite perisht, supposed by the Inhabitants to haue beene made for certaine Noblemen, Lords of this Mannor. Which may very well be true, by these words of our grand Antiquarie Master Camden. Somewhat aboue (saith hee) Flamsted sheweth it selfe vpon the hill, which in the time of King Edward the Confessour, Leosstane the Abbot of Saint Albans gaue vnto three Knights, Turnot, Waldefe, and Turman, for to defend and secure the countrey thereby against theeues. But William the Conquerour tooke it from them, and gaue it to Roger Todeney, or Tony, a noble Norman, whose possession it was, but by a daughter it was transfer∣red at length to the Beauchamps, Earles of Warwicke.

This Torynton, as I haue it by relation, was the founder of this Church, a man in speciall fauour with Edmond Plantaginet, Duke of Cornwall; who was sonne of Richard Plantaginet, second sonne of king Iohn, Earle of Cornwall, and king of the Romanes. Which Richard full of honours and yeares, ended his life here at his Castle of Berkamsted, but was buried at his Abbey of Hales. Of whom hereafter. Here are diuers Tombes to the memory of the name of Waterhouse, whose inscriptions of antiquitie are all taken away with the brasse, and the carefull preseruing of the rest altogether neglected.

So named of the Kings house thereunto adioyning, wherein Edmund Plantaginet, Foundation . the fifth sonne of King Edward the third, was borne; and thereupon surnamed Edmund of Langley. Hereby was a religious House for preaching Friers, founded by Roger the sonne of Robert Helle, an Eng∣lish Baron, Edmund Planginet Duke of Yorke, Isabell his wife. valued to be yeerely worth at the suppression, one hundred and fifty pound fourteene shillings eight pence; in the Church of this monaste¦rie the foresaid Edmund was interred. He was Lord of Tindale, Earle of Cambridge, and Duke of Yorke. He married Isabell, second daughter and one of the heires of Peter, King of Castile and Leon, who died before him in the yeare 1393, and was buried in this Friery; by whom hee had issue Edward Earle of Rutland, Duke of Albamarle and Yorke; Richard Earle of Cambridge, and a daughter, whose name was Constance. He had a se∣cond wife whose name was Ioane, daughter of Thomas Holland, Earle of Kent; who after his death was married to William Lord Willoughby of Eresby, to Henry Lord Scroope, and to Henry Bromflet, Lord Vescy. He is reckoned for one of the Knights of the Garter, and in the absence of his fa∣ther in France, is said to be Protectour of the Realme of England. Hee is much commended for his affabilitie and gentle deportment, as also for his valour; of which will you heare my often alledged Author, Io. Harding.

This renowned Duke deceased (saith Stow ) in the yeare 1402. the third of Henry the fourth, and was here buried neare to his wife, with two of his brethren, who died young. Pierce Gaueston Fade of Cornwall. Here sometime lay entombed the body of Pierce Gaueston (a Gascoigne borne) Lord of the Isle of Man, and Earle of Cornwall. A man in such fauour with Edward the second (hauing before ensnared his youth by the allurements of a corrupt life) that hee had from the said King whatsoeuer could be poured vpon him. For though it might seeme incredible (saith Speed out of the booke of Dunstable) he both gaue him his Iewels and an∣cestors treasure, and euen the Crowne it selfe of his victorious father: not sticking to professe (if it lay in him) hee should succeed him in the king∣dome. But his insolencie, and presumption vpon the kings fauour, made him so farre to forget himselfe, as that he scorned the best of the Nobilitie, as much as they hated him: miscalling and giuing them scoffes, with bitter iests; which left behinde them a sowre remembrance, and the sting of re∣uenge. Of all which my old timer who flourished about those dayes, thus speaketh more seriously in Prose. Rob. Glocest. Perys went into the kyngys Tresorye in ye Abbey of West∣minstre (saith he) and yer toke away a tabil of gold wyth the tres∣sel, and other oyer ryche Iuwels, the whyche wer sumtym king Ar∣thurys: and hem he toke to a merchant yat het Aymery of Fris∣comband, and bar hem ouer the see into Gascoigne, and yay wer neuer brought ayen, yat was gret harme to yet Reme. And this Sure Perys gretly despysyd the Lordys of ye londe, and atte yat tym Sure Perys called. clupyd Robard of Clare ye Erle of Gloucetre Hore sone and ye Erle of Penbrok, Ioseph ye Iew, and ye Erle of Lincolne.

Eherle, and oyer meny despytes he s yd to ye Lordys of Englonde wherfor yay weryn sore agreuyd. And so much agrieued they were, that they surprised him in the night at a viliage or mannour called Dathington, or Deddington, betweene Oxford and Warwick, from whence Guy Earle of Warwick tooke him to his Castle of Warwicke, where in a place called Blacklow (afterward Gaueshead) his head was stricken off the nineteenth of Iune, 1311. at the commandement and in the presence of the Earles of Lancaster, Warwicke, and Hereford, as of one that had beene a subuerter of the Lawes, and an open Traitour to the kingdome. A violent and vnaduised part of these Lords, to put to death an Earle so dearly loued of the King, without any iudiciall procee∣ding by triall of his Peeres: which caused a lasting hatred betwixt the King and his Nobles, and was the beginning of the second ciuill warre of Eng∣land. Some two yeares after this Tragedie, King Edward caused the bo∣die of his Gaueston to be transferred, with great pompe, from the place of his former buriall (which was among the Friers Preachers at Oxford) to this Friery of his owne foundation (saith Stow. ) Where he in person with the Archbishop of Canterbury, foure Bishops, many Abbots, and princi∣pall Churchmen did honour the Exequies, but few were present of the Nobilitie; whose great stomacks would not giue them leaue to attend. This was the end of that fatall great Fauourite Gaueston, who, for that hee was the first Priuado (saith Sam. Danyel in the life of Ed. the second) of this kinde euer noted in our History, and was aboue a King in his life, deserues to haue his character among Princes being dead. Which is thus deliuered. Natiue he was of Gascoine, Pierce Gaueston described. by birth a Gentlman; and for the great ser∣vice his father had done to this Crowne, intertained and bred vp by king Edward the first, in companie with his sonne this Prince, which was the meanes that inuested him into that high fauour of his; Hee was of a good∣ly personage, of an haughtie and vndauntable spirit, braue and hardie at Armes, as he shewed himselfe in that Turneament which he held at Wal∣lingford, wherein he challenged the best of the Nobilitie, and is said to haue foiled them all; which inflamed the more their malice towards him. In Ireland where he was Lieutenant, during the short time of his banish∣ment, he made a iourney into the mountaines of Dublin; brake and sub∣dued the Rebels there, built Newcastle in the Kernes country, repayred castle Keuin, and after passed vp into Munster and Thomond, performing euery where great seruice with much valour and worthinesse: Hee seemes to haue beene a Courtier, which could not fawne nor stoope to those he lo∣ued not, or put on any disguise vpon his Nature to temporize with his ene∣mies. But presuming vpon his fortune (the misfortune of such men) grew in the end to that arrogancie as was intollerable; which the priuacie of a Kings fauour usually begets in their Minions; whose vnderstanding and iudgement being dazed therewith, as is their sight, who stand and looke downe from off high places, neuer discerne the ground from whence they ascended. And this extraordinarie fauour shewed to one, though he were the best of men, when it arises to an excesse, is like the predomination of one humour alone in the body, which endangers the health of the whole, and especially if it light vpon vnworthinesse, or where is no desert; and com∣monly Princes raise men rather for appetite, then merit: for that in the one they shew the freedome of their power, in the other they may seeme but to pay their debt. This old Latine rime was made in those dayes, vpon the death of this Gaueston : by a Monke of S. Maries Yorke. Dum Petrus seuit propriam mortem sibi neuit Nunc patet vt nevit, truncatus ense quieuit. Besides his honours before remembred, he was Protector or Gardian of the Realme, during the Kings aboad in France, about his marriage with Isabell, the daughter of Philip the faire French King; which indeed was an office but of eighteene dayes continuance, as appeares by the sequele. .

Here is now the seate of that right honourable Lord, Sir Edward Carey, knight, Baron of Falkland, lately Lord Deputie of Ireland. Some of which familie lie here fairely entombed. South Mimmes.

In the Quire of this Church lieth entombed the body of Sir Raph Sad∣leir, Sir Raph Sad∣leir knight Banneret. the last knight Banneret of England; priuye Counsellor to three Prin∣ces. A man so aduanced (saith Camden ) for his great Seruices and stayed wisdome. Hee was brought vp vnder politicke great Cromwell, Earle of Essex (as appeares by the prose and verse engrauen vpon his Monument) who, when he came to mans estate, employed him as his Secretary. But Henry the eight conceiued so good an opinion of his discreet comporte∣ment, and ingenious pregnancie, that he tooke him from the seruice of the sayd Cromwell about the twentie and sixt yeare of his raigne, made him his principall Secretary; and vsed his aduice in matters of greatest trust and im∣portance, especially in the affaires and passages betwixt the two Realmes of England and Scotland. He continued his loue towards him to the end of his life; and for the speciall trust and confidence hee had in his approued wisedome and fidelitie, together with the Earle of Arundell, the Earle of Essex, and others, he made choise of him for the ayding and assisting of the Executors of his last Will and Testament; by which his last Will (the co∣pie whereof I haue in my custody) he gaue him two hundred pounds as a Legacie. In the first of Edward the sixt hee was chosen Treasurer for the Armie sent into Scotland, vnder the conduct of Edward Duke of Somerset, Pro∣tector, and Iohn Earle of Warwicke; where, in the battell of Musselborrow, he shewed great manhood and prowesse. His great diligence, saith Hollinshead, in bringing the scattered troopes into order, and ready forwardnesse in the fray, did worthily merit no small commendacions; After which Battle he with Sir Francis Brian, Captaine of the light horsemen, and Sir Raph Vane, Captaine of all the horsemen, were honoured for their valiant good seruice, with the dignitie of Knights Bannerets. In the tenth yeare of the raigne of Queene Elisabeth hee was preferred, and aduanced by her, to the Chancellourship of the Dutchie of Lancaster. But his honours and offices are most succinctly engrauen vpon his goodly Tombe, in these Hexameters.

This Inscription here engrauen to the memory of such a remarkeable man, being Squire for the Body to three such potent Princes, Ensigne or Penon-bearer to one, and Master of the Horse to Ioane, the second wife of King Henry the fourth, giues me occasion to speake somewhat in particular of these his honours and offices. And first in generall of the signification and Etymology of the name of Esquire. Next in degree after knights (saith Camden in his treatise of Degrees of States in England) are Esquires, termed in Latine Armigeri, that is, Co∣strels, or Bearers of Armes, the same that Scutiferi, that is, Shield-bearers, and Homines ad arma, Men at Armes: the Gothes called them Schilpor, all, of carrying the Shield: as in old time among the Romanes, such as were named Scularij, who tooke that name either of the Escutcheons of Armes which they bare as Ensignes of their descent, or because they were Armour-bearers to Princes, or to the better sort of Nobilitie. Ranulph Earle of Che∣ster, giues Viello Armigero suo tenementum in Bruhello, Cart. Ranul. Com. cestrie. to Viell his Es∣quire a Tenement in Bruhell. And so Archbishops, Bishops, Barons, knights, & huiusmodi Magnates, Flesa. lib. 1. ca. 27. and such sort of Peeres of the kingdome had their Esquiers. In times past euery knight had two of these waiting vpon him: they car∣ried his Morion and Shield; as inseparable companions they stucke close vnto him, because of the said knight their Lord, they held certaine Lands in Escuage, like as the knight himselfe of the king by Knights seruice. The old Gaulish knights (saith Selden ) sate at their round table attended by their Esquires. Tit. of Honor. Par. 2. ca. 10. The Germans called an Esquire Schild-knapa, or Shield-knaue, or knaue, a denotation of no ill qualitie in those dayes. For here note by the way, that Iohannes de Temporibus, Iohn of the Times (so called for the sun∣drie times or ages he liued) was Shield-knaue vnto the Emperour Charles the Great. Of whom he also was made knight, as Verstegan affirmes in his Treatise of Honor and Offices. The Interpreter out of Hotoman, Io. Cowell. Dec. l. C. lit. E. saith that these which the French men call Escuiers, wee Esquiers, were a militarie kind of vassall, hauing ius Scuti, which is as much to say, as that they bare a Shield, and in it the Ensignes of their Familie, in token of their gentility or dignitie. But these Esquires, Fiue sorts of Esquires. of whom I haue already spoken, be now no more in any request; fiue distinct sorts are onely remaining of these at this day. The principall Esquires are accounted those that are select Esquires for the Princes bodie, and such a one was Perient here interred Inter Armige∣ros qui f unt non nascuntur Primarij habentur quatuor illi Armigeri ad corpus Regis: Glossar. lit. . Amongst Esquires which are made so by their offices (not so borne) those foure Esquires to the kings bodie are chiefe and princiall, saith Sir H. Spelman. The next vnto them be knights eldest sonnes: and such an Esquire was the knights sonne in Chaucer, who attended his father on pil∣grimage to Thomas Beckets Shrine, as doth appeare by their characters in the Prologues to the Canterbury tales. Of which so much as tends to this purpose. A Knyght ther was, and that a worthy man, That fro the tyme that he first began To riden out, he loued cheualrie, Trouth, honour, freedome, and courtesie. —he was late come fro his voyage, And went for to done his pilgrimage. With him there was his son a yong squire, A louer, and a lusty Bachelere: With his locks crull as they were laid in presse, Of twenty yere of age he was as I gesse. Curteys he was lowly and servisable, And kerste before his Fader at the table. In a third place are reputed younger sonnes of the eldest sonnes of Ba∣rons, and of other Nobles in higher estate; and when such heires males faile, together with them also the title faileth. In a fourth ranke are reckoned those, vnto whom the King himselfe, to∣gether with a title, giueth Armes, or createth Esquires, by putting about their necke a siluer collar of S S, and (in former times) vpon their heeles a paire of white spurres siluered: whereupon at this day in the West parts of the kingdome, they be called White-spurres, for distinction from knights, who are wont to weare gilt spurres: and to the first-begotten sonnes onely of these doth the title belong. In the fifth and last place be those ranged, and taken for Esquires; who∣soeuer haue any superiour publicke Office in the common weale, or serue the Prince in any worshipfull calling. But this name of Esquire, which in ancient time was a name of charge and office onely, crept first among other titles of dignitie and worship (so farre as I could euer obserue, saith Camden ) in the raigne of Richard the second. In ancient deeds we finde little mention made of gentlemen or Esquires, but since the time of Henry the fourth these additions to names haue beene vsually inserted in writings, by reason of the Statute of the first of Henry the fifth, cap. 5. that in all cases wherein Processe of Outlary lieth, additions shall be made of the estate, degree, or Misterie of which the parties sued are.

This ancient familie of the Bawdes, Stow saith, as he had read out of an ancient deed, gaue vnto the Deane and Chapter of Pauls, vpon the day of the conuersion of Saint Paul, a good Doe; and vpon the feast of the com∣memoration of Saint Paul, a fat Bucke; in consideration of twenty two A∣cres of land, by them granted, within their Mannor of Westley in Essex, to be inclosed into their Parke of Coringham. Sir William Baud about the third of Edward the first, was the first that granted this deed, which was confirmed by his sonne Walter, and others of his line. This Bucke and Doe were brought vpon the said festiuall daies, at the houres of Procession, S ru y in Fa∣r g ward . and thorow the Procession to the high Altar; the manner of it is reported by Stow, who partly (as he saith) saw it, thus. On the feast day of the commemoration of Saint Paul, the Bucke being brought vp to the steps of the high Altar in Pauls Church, at the houre of Procession, the Deane and Chapter being apparelled in Coapes and Vest∣ments, with Garlands of Roses on their heads, A Bucks head borne before the Procession at Pauls. they sent the body of the Bucke to baking, and had the head fixed on a Pole, borne before the Crosse in their Procession, vntill they issued out of the West dore; where the Kee∣per that brought it, blowed the death of the Bucke, and then the Horners that were about the Citie, presently answered him in like manner. For the which paines, they had each man of the Deane and Chapter, foure pence in money, and their dinner, and the Keeper that brought it, was al∣lowed, during his abode there for that seruice, meate, drinke and lodging, at the Deane and Chapters charges, and fiue shillings in money, at his go∣ing away, together with a loafe of bread, hauing the picture of Saint Paul vpon it, &c.

Howsoeuer he that giues not an answer is deep∣ly amerced; which seruile attendance (said he) was imposed at the first, vp∣on certaine Tenants of diuers Mannors hereabouts, for conspiring in this place, at such an vnseasonable time, to raise a commotion. The title of the Entrie of the Court, hee had in memory, and writ it downe for me when we came to Rochford. Thus it runnes in obscure barbarous rimes.

And being by our Ancestours honoured for a Saint, Richard de Beaveyes Bishop of London, in her memoriall, built here a religious house, of Regular Chanons, about the yeare 1120. in the raigne of King Henry the first. His grant I haue read in the Records of the Tower, Cart. Antiq, lit. beginning thus. Richardus Dei gratia London Episcopus, &c. Salu∣tem.

King Henry confirmes and augments this donation by his Charter dated at Roan in the nineteenth yeare of his raigne. And many others so added to the reuenues of this Monastery, that at the time of the suppression, it was valued at 758. pound, fiue shillings eight pence. This Bishop, the founder, was diuers times about to resigne his Bishopricke, that he might become a regular Canon in this his owne new built Monasterie; and that the rather, because being taken with an irrecouerable Palsie, Godwin. de Prefisl. Angl. he well knew his time to be short. But he so long deferred the execution of this intent, that he was surprised by death before he could performe it, the sixteenth day of Ianua∣rie, 1127. He was Warden of the marches of Wales, and gouernour of the County of Salop, he sate Bishop twenty yeares, in which time (beside the building of this Monastery) he purchased diuers whole streets, and much housing neere to his Cathedrall Church of Saint Pauls. All which he pull∣ed downe, and leauing the ground vnbuilt for a Cemitery or Churchyard, enclosed the same with a wall, which for the most part remaineth; but at this day so couered with houses, as it can hardly be seene. The Canons of this house desired his body to be here buried: which they entombed vnder a marble Monument with this inscription. Hic iacet Richardus Beauueis, Rich. Beauueis Bishop of Lon¦don.

Diuers other faire monuments (but shamefully defaced) are here erected to the memory of the Darcies, a numerous familie, and for antiquity and noblenesse of birth, of great respect in many places of this kingdome. Sir Robert Darcy Knight, remembred in the former inscription, by his last will and testament, bequeathed his body to be buried in this Church; the substance whereof I haue read in an old Manuscript, In bib.

Here in this towne sometime stood a religious house of Carmelites or white Friers, founded by Richard de Grauesend, Bishop of London, and one Richard Iselham a Priest, about the yeare 1292. valued at the suppres∣sion at twentie sixe pounds, eight shillings: a poore Foundation for so great a Prelate, hauing the assistance and charitable contribution of another Priest. Th Maldon. This little couent was honoured with diuers great schollers, which I finde to haue beene therein buried: and first Thomas Maldon, so called of this towne, the place of his birth, brought vp of a boy in this house of the Carmelites; from whence hee went to Cambridge, when hee attained to ripenesse of yeares, where he profited exceedingly in all kindes of learning; in so much that he was chosen to be the chiefe master or professor of Diui∣nity in that Vniuersity; he was, saith Pits, de illustribus Anglie scriptoribus, from whom Bale doth not much dissent, subtilis disputator, elegans cōciona∣tor, in omni concertatione scholastica promptus et expeditus, in dubiis expli∣candis clarus et dilucidus, in decernendis et diffiniendis rebus arduis constans et solidus. He was called from Cambridge to take vpon him the gouernement of this Priorie; in which office he ended his daies, in the yeare 1404. and was interred in the Church of his Couent; vpon whose Tombe this Epitaph was engrauen, as I haue it in a Manuscript.

Within this Citie and the suburbes are contained ten Parish Churches; in all which I could collect no more Inscriptions of any antiquitie, saue these in Saint Gyles Church. But howsoeuer her Churches at this day be no wayes beautified with the ancient funerall Trophies of any illustrious per∣sonages; yet her inhabitants may bragge of the buriall of Coill, that braue British Prince, who built this their Towne of Colchester, about one hun∣dred twenty and foure yeares after the birth of our Sauiour Christ. Where∣in his sonne Lucius, Helena, and Constantine, the first Christian King, Em∣presse, and Emperour in the world, were borne: which made Necham (saith Speed ) for Constantine to sing as he did. Speed in Essex. From Colchester there rose a Starre, The Rayes whereof gaue glorious light Throughout the world, in climates farre; Great Constantine Romes Emperour bright. This Coilus was brought vp euen from his youth in Rome, and there∣fore fauouring the Romanes, payed them his tribute. He raigned fifty fiue yeares saith Stow. Harding saith but eleuen.

Iohns. stood a large and stately Monastery, which Eudo Sewar to king Henry the firs , founded and consecrated to the honour of Christ and Saint Iohn Baptist, wherein he placed blacke Monkes. The Ancestors of the right honourable Sir Edward Sackvile, knight of the Bath, and Earle of Dorset, were great benefactours, or rather cofounders of this religious structure. For in the booke of the Abbey of Colchester I haue read, In Lib. Colt. Iordan and Ro¦bert Sackvile. that Iordanus de Saukevil miles et Baro de Bergholt Saukevil, filius & heres Roberti Saukevil, superstes tempore Stephani Regis, & Henrici secun∣di confirmavit Ecclesie Sancti Iohannis de Colecestria in perpetuam Eleemo∣sinam, manerium de Wicham (or Witham ) quod pater s us Robertus eidem Ecclesie donauerat. The foresaid Eudo founded likewise in this Towne an Hospitall for peo¦ple infected with the contagious disease of Leprosie, Foundation of the Hospitall for Lep s. which he dedicated to Saint Mary Magdalen. Here was another religious house wherein were placed brethren of the holy Crosse, Foundation of the Friery of the holy Crosse but by whom founded I cannot finde.

So called of the Sepulture of the Earles of Oxford, Camd. in Ox∣ford. which deriue their descent (saith Camden ) from the Earles of Guines in France, and haue the surname of Vere from Vere a Towne in Zeland. In this parish Church are two Monuments of this familie of the Veres, the one lieth crosse-legd, with a Sarasins head vpon his tombe, which Sarasin (say the Inhabitants) this Earle slew in the holy Land. The other of them with his wife, lieth en∣tombed; at her feet is the Talbot, at his feet the Boare: they are both shamefully defaced. They were remooued out of the Priory neare adioi∣ning at the suppression, as I was told. This Priorie was first founded by Aubrey de Vere soone after the Con∣quest, The founda∣tion of Colne Prio ie. which he dedicated to the honour of God and Saint Andrew ; and placed therein black Monks, translated from Abingdon, to which Abbey he made this Priory to be subiect vpon this occasion, In Rib. Cott. as I haue it out of the booke of Abingdon. Godfrey de Vere the sonne and heire of the foresaid Aubrey by Beatrice his wife, dying in his fathers life time, was buried in the Monastery of A∣bingdon, to which he had beene a benefactor, whereupon, saith the Story, Aubrey his father and Beatrice his mother were determined to choose A∣bingdon for their buriall place, in respect of the tender affection they bore to their child. But their Lands lying here in Essex farre off, they procured a Grant from King Henry the first to build a religious House at Colne in Essex, for their soules health, their Sonnes, and others, as also for their Se∣pultures; et hanc domum Sancto Andr e Apostolo dedicatam, subiectam et coher ntem Ecclesie Abingdonen si faciebant. Not long after the finishing of this worke, and a little before his death, Aubrey the Founder tooke vpon him the habite of Religion in this his owne house, wherein hee died, and was here buried by a younger sonne of his, named William, in whose re∣membrance this Epitaph was engrauen vpon their Monument.

The house is standing at this day, conuerted into a priuate dwelling place, as also the old Chappell to it, wherein are diuers Monuments, vnder which lie buried many of this thrice honourable Familie of the Veres, but they are all gone to decay, and their Inscriptions by time and stealth quite taken away. Vpon one Tombe of Ala∣baster which is thought to bee the ancientest, is the pourtraiture of a man lying in his armour, crosse-legged, but what was carued at his feet cannot be discerned. Vpon another, is one lying armed wtih the blew Bore vnder his head, which was also crosse-legged, as I was informed; but now is no∣thing remaining from the middle downeward. A third of wood armed crosse-legged, on his Target the Armes of the house of Oxford; and there lieth by him a woman made of wood, which is thought to haue beene his Lady, and Countesse. Here are two more likewise in wood armed, and crosse-legged, the one hath an Hound or Talbot vnder his feet: the cote Armour of the other is quite broken away with his Target. Here is one in Alabaster not crosse-legged, the Garter about one of his legges; what is vn∣der his feet cannot be discerned. A woman pourtrayed in Alabaster with a Falcon vnder her feet, and a little Monument of Alabaster, vpon which is the image of one in a Gowne, with a purse hanging at his girdle: hee is in length about foure foot. But I will shew the Reader the names of such Earles and others of this house which by supposition and certainty are said to haue beene heere interred; which may giue some light to the further knowledge of these, in this manner intombed. Aubrey de Vere the sonne of Aubrey, Aubrey de Vere the first Earle of Oxford, surnamed the grimme. Chamberlaine vnder King Henry the first, or Camerarius Anglie, as I finde it in old Cartularies, hauing lost this his Office of great Chamberlaine, and other dignities, in the turmoiles betweene King Stephen and Maude the Empresse, was by the said Empresse and Henry the second (as you may haue it more fully in Vincents discouery of errours) restored to all his former honours, and withall created Earle of Oxford. He died in the yeare 1194. the sixth of king Richard the first, and was here buried by his father. Lib. Alb. de Colne. His wife Agnes or Adeliza lieth buried by him, who was the daughter of Henry of Essex, Baron of Ralegh, the Kings Constable. Such was the Epitaph or inscription vpon his Tombe, as it is in the book of Colne Priory. Aubrey de Vere the second Earle of Ox∣ford.

Richardi . sexto. Aubrey de Vere, the sonne of the foresaid Aubrey, succeeded his father in all his dignities; I finde little written of him in our Histories, saue that out of his Christian pietie he did confirme the gift of septem librat. terre which Aubrey his father gaue to the Chanons of Saint O sith here in Essex, adding thereto something of his owne. He dyed in the yeare of our Lord, 1214. and sleepeth now in the same Bed, with three other Aubreyes his Ancestors. To whom this Epitaph vpon Conrad the Emperour at Spires in Germany may be fitly applied. Filius hic, Pater hic, Auus hic, Proauus iacet istie.

Earle of Oxford, and Lord great Chamberlaine of England, was here entombed with his Ancestors, who died in the yeare 1263. He had the title of Lord Bolebeck, which came by his mother Isabell de Bolebeck, daughter and heire of Hugh de Bolebeck, a Baron, who was Lord of Bolebeck Castle in Whitechurch within Buckinghamshire, and of Swaffam Bolebeck in Cam∣bridgeshire. Hee had to wife Hawisia the daughter of Saier de Quin∣cy, Earle of Winchester, as appeares by this Inscription sometime insculpt vpon their Tombe.

Robert de Vere, the sonne of Hugh aforesaid, Earle of Oxford, who en∣ioyed his fathers inheritances and honours the space of thirtie and two yeares, lieth here entombed with his ancestours: who died in the yeare 1295. Alice his wife, the daughter and heire of Gilbert Lord Samford, Lord of Hormead in Hertfordshire was interred by him, who died at Caufeld house neare Dunmow, the ninth day of September, 1312. Robert de Vere the sonne of Robert Earle of Oxford. Here lieth buried the body of Robert de Vere, sonne and successour to the foresaid Robert, whose gouernment both in peace and warre was so pru∣dent, his hospitalitie and other workes of charitie so wisely abundant; and his Temperance with a religious zeale so admirablie conioyned, that he was of all surnamed the good Earle of Oxford; and the vulgar esteemed him as a Saint. He died the 19. of Aprill, 1331. Robert de Vere Earle of Oxford, and Duke of Ireland Here lyeth entombed Robert de Vere, Richard the seconds Mignion; who to adde to his honours created him Marquesse of Dublin, a title not knowne before that time in England, and in the yeare following Duke of Ireland, with commission to execute most inseparable prerogatiues royall. These Stiles were of too high a nature, and therefore infinitely subiected to enuy. Whereupon, like a second Gaueston, he was hated of the Nobilitie; especially for that he was a man nec prudentia, caeteris proceribus, nec armis valentior, as Walsingham saith, 9. R. 2. But it was not long before he was banished England by the Barons, for abusing the Kings eare to the hurt of the State. He had to wife a young, faire, and noble Lady, and the Kings neare kinswoman (for she was grandchilde to King Edward by his daugh∣ter Isabell ) he put her away, and tooke one of Queene Annes women, a Bo∣hemian of base birth, Sellarij filia, saith Walsingham, a Sadlers daughter, some say a Ioyners, an act full of wickednesse and indignitie. Yet this in∣tollerable villanie offered to the bloud-royall, Speed in vita R. 2. King Richard did not en∣counter, neither had the power, some say, who deemed that by witchcrafts and forceries (practised vpon him by one of the Dukes followers) his iudge∣ment was so seduced and captiuated, that he could not see what was honest or si to doe. But where Princes are wilfull or slothfull, and their Fauorites flatterers or time-seruers, there needs no other enchantments to infatuate, yea and ruinate the greatest Monarch. Vpon his banishment he went into France, where he liued about fiue yeares, and there being a hunting, he was slaine by a wilde Boare, in the yeare 1392. King Richard hearing thereof, out of his loue, caused his body to be brought into England, and to be ap∣parrelled in Princely ornaments and robes, and put about his neck a chaine of gold, and Rings vpon his fingers, and so was buried in this Priory; the King being there present, and wearing blackes. Aubrey de Vere Earle of Ox∣ford. After the death of Robert Duke of Ireland, who died without issue, his Nephew Aubrey de Vere succeeded him in the Earledome of Oxford; he enioyed his honours not passing eight yeares, but dyed die Veneris in festo Sancti Georgij, Ann. primo Hen. quarti, 1400. and lieth here entombed with his worthie Ancestors. Iohn de Vere Earle of Ox∣ford. Here lieth buried in this Priorie Iohn de Vere, the third of that Christian name, and the thirteenth Earle of Oxford, Lord Bolebecke, Samford, and Scales, great Chamberlaine, and Lord high Admirall of England. Who died the fourth of Henry the eight, 1512. hauing beene Earle of Oxford full fifty yeares; a long time to tugge out, in the troublesome raignes of so many kings, especially for men of eminent places and high spirits, euer apt to take any occasion to shew their manly prowesse: which fire of honour flamed in this Earles breast, at Barnet field, where (in a mist) the great Earle of Warwickes men, not able to distinguish betwixt the Sun with streames vpon King Edwards liuery, and the Starre with streames on this Earles li∣uery, shot at this Earles followers; and by that misprision the battell was lost. After which he fled into Cornwall, and seized vpon Saint Michaels Mount. But Edward the fourth got him in his power, and committed him prisoner to the Castle of Hames beyond the Seas, where he remained for the space of twelue yeares, vntill the first of King Henry the seuenth, with whom he came into England, and by whom he was made Captaine of the Archers at Bosworth-field, where after a short resistance hee discomfited the Foreward of King Richard, whereof a great number were slaine in the chase, and no small number fell vnder the victors sword. This Earle gaue a great contribution to the finishing of Saint Maries Church in Cambridge; His hospitalitie, and the great port he carried here in his country, may be gathered out of a discourse, in that exquisite History of Henry the seuenth, penned by that learned and iudicious Statesman, Sir Francis Bacon, Viscount Saint Alban, lately deceased. The last Earle that I finde to be here entombed of ancient times, Io de Vere E. of Oxford. is Iohn de Vere, the fourth of that christian name, Earle of Oxford, Lord Bulbeck Samford and Scales, Lord great Chamberlaine of England, and Knight of the Garter; he was commonly called little Iohn of Campes, Castle Cam∣pes, in Cambridgeshire, being the ancient seate of the Veres, where this Earle vsed much to reside; He married Anne, daughter of Thomas How∣ard Duke of Norfolke, and died without issue the 14 of July, 1526. I finde in a booke of Dunmow, Maud, Coun∣tesse of Oxford in bib. Cot. that Maud, the wife of Iohn de Vere the seuenth Earle of Oxford, lyeth here intombed: shee was the daughter of Bartholomew, Lord Badelismere, Baron of Leedes in Kent; and one of the heires of Giles Lord Badelismere her brother. She was first married to Robert, sonne of Robert Fitz-Paine. She outliued her later hus∣band some few yeares, and died the 24. of May, 1365. ... Coggeshall. ....... Coggeshale ...... mil. ....

Foundation of Coggeshall Abbey. in bib. Cott Here in this towne of Cogshal was sometime an Abbey built, and en∣dowed by King Stephen, and Maud his Queene, in the yeare 1140. the fift of his raigne, according to the booke of Saint Austins in Canterbury, An∣no M. c. xl. facta est Abbathia de Cogeshal a Rege Stephano et Matilde Re∣gina, qui primo fundauerunt Abbathiam de Furnesse, Abbatiam de Longe∣leyrs, et postea Abbathiam de Feuersham, &c. this house was dedicated to the blessed Virgin Mary, wherein were placed white Monkes luniackes; the reuenues of which were valued to be yearely worth 298. l. 8. s. it was surrendred the 18. of March, 29. Hen. 8. Adioyning to the Rode called Coccill-way, which to this towne lea∣deth, was lately found an arched Vault of bricke, and therein a burning lampe of glasse couered with a Romane Tyle some 14 inches square, and one Vrne with ashes and bones, besides two sacrificing dishes of smooth and pollished red earth, hauing the bottome of one of them with faire Ro∣mane letters inscribed, COCCILLI.M. I may probably coniecture this to haue beene the sepulchrall monument of the Lord of this towne, who liued about the time of Antoninus Pius, (as by the coyne there like∣wise found appeareth) the affinitie betweene his and the now townes name being almost one and the same. These remaine in the custody of that iudi∣cious great Statesman Sir Richard Weston Knight, Baron Weston of Nea∣land, Lord Treasurer of England, and of the most honourable Order of the Garter companion. Who for his approued vertues and industrie, both vnder father and sonne, doth to the publique good fully answere the place and dignity. Before these times, in a place called Westfield, three quarters of a mile distant from this towne, and belonging to the Abbey there, was found by touching of a plough, Camd. in Essex a great brasen pot: The ploughmen supposing to haue beene hid treasure, sent for the Abbot of Cogeshall to see the taking vp of it; and he going thither, met with Sir Clement Harleston, and desired him also to accompany him thither. The mouth of the pot was closed with a white substance, like past or clay, as hard as burned bricke: when that by force was remoued, there was found within it another pot, but that was of earth; that being opened, there was found in it a lesser pot of earth, of the quantity of a gallon, couered with a matter like Veluet, and fastened at the mouth with a silke lace; in it they found some whole bones, and ma∣ny pieces of small bones wrapped vp in fine silke, of fresh colour, which the Abbot tooke for the reliques of some Saints, and laid vp in his Vestuary. Bocking Dorewards. So denominated of the Dorewardes sometimes Lords of this towne, and Patrons of this fat Parsonage, which is xxxv.l. x. s. in the Kings bookes▪ as I am perswaded by relation, and these Inscriptions vpon ancient Tombes.

In a parchment Roll without date, The founda∣tion of a Prio¦rie in Heue∣ningham. belonging to the Earle of Oxford, I find that one Lucia (belike some one of that right honourable house) foun∣ded a Priory in this Parish for blacke veyled Nunnes: Which she dedicated to the holy Grosse, and the blessed Virgine Mary. Of which religious foun∣dation she her selfe was the first Prioresse: whose death was wondrously la∣mented by Agnes, who did next succeed her in that office, and the rest of the Couent: who desire the prayers and suffrages of all the religious houses in England, for her soules health. The forme whereof to transcribe, cannot seeme much impertinent to the subiect I haue in hand, nor tedious to the iudicious Reader.

Recte ideo Lucia dicta, quia nomen beate virginis Lucie sortita, illius pro viribus imitabatur exempla. Illa meritis & precibus fluxum sanguinis in Matre deleuit. Ista in se omnis motus concupiscentie carnalis restringens, fluxum in aliis incontinentie & contaminationis per ariditatem sancte conuersationis & sobrie vite radicitus extirpauit. Illa sponso suo carnalem copulam nutu diuino subtraxit. Ista vt nouimus vinculo Matrimonij septies constricta, consortii virilis ignara; in∣contaminata semper & illesa permansit, & ita de laqueo venantium tempo∣raliter est erepta. Et hoc fecit diuina prudentia, vt nullum preter eum ad∣mitteret amatorem. Ista etiam discreta fuit in silentio vtilis in verbo, vere∣cundia grauis, pudore venerabilis, singulis compassione proxima, pre cunctis contemplatione suspensa; sicque studuit bene agentibus esse per humilitatem socia vt per zelum iusticie delinquentium corrigeret errata. Vnde in titilla∣tione carnis ex ea didicimus habere prudentiam, in aduersitate fortitudinem; in tribulatione patientiam, in desperatione solatium; in periculo refugium, in estu refrigerium, in asperitate lenitatem. Et suit nobis ipsius exemplo lectio fr quentior, oratio pinguior, & feruentior affectus.

Et hec talis tantaque sub∣lata est, et hec omnia simul. Migrauit autem ad illum qui sibi fructuum deci∣mas persolui voluit, qui etiam Decalogum constituit mandatorum. Misere∣mini igitur nostri, miseremini nostri saltem vos amici nostri; et vobis miseris compatiamini fluentes lacrimas per orationum suffragia desiccantes: quia pi∣um est & saluberrimum pro defunctis exorare vt à peccatis solvantur.

This Towne was famous in times past, (saith Clarentieux ) for a Castle of the Magnauilles (which now is almost all vanished out of sight) and an Abbey adioyning, The foundati∣on of Walden Abbey. founded in a place very commodious, in the yeare 1136. wherein the Magnauilles, founders thereof, were buried. The principall and first founder hereof, was Geffrey Magnauile, or Mandeuill the first Earle of Essex, with Rohesia or Rose his wife, daughter of Aubrey de Vere, chiefe Iustice of England, who consecrated this their religious Structure to the honour of God, the blessed Virgin Mary, and Saint Iames the A∣postle, endowed it with large reuenues, and placed therein blacke Monkes; to which effect will it please you reade a few words out of his deed of Grant. In Arch. Tu r. . Gaufridus de Mandeuilla comes Essex, &c. salutem. Ad vniuersitatis ve∣sire noticiam volo peruenire me fundasse quoddam monasterium in vsus Mo∣nachorum apud Waldenam, in honore Dei, et sancte Marie et beati Iacobi Apostoti, pro salute anime mee et omnium parentum, antecessorum & success∣sorum meorum, &c. To which by the same deed hee giueth the Churches of Walden, Waltham, Estrene, Sabridgworth, Thorley and others. This house was valued at the suppression, to be yearely worth, foure hundred sixe pounds, fifteene shillings and eleuen pence. This place is now called Audley End, of Sir Thomas Audley Lord Chancelour, (of whom I haue spoken before) who changed the Abbey in∣to his owne dwelling house; whose sole daughter and heire Margaret, was second wife to Thomas Howard Duke of Norfolke, and mother of Thomas Lord Howard of Walden, Earle of Suffolke, lately deceased, who liued to finish here a most magnificent building, belonging at this present to that worthy gentleman Theophilus his sonne and heire, Lord Walden and Earle of Suffolke. Geffrey de Mandeuill the founder aforesaid, a man both mighty and martiall, was shot into the head with an arrow, a quodam pedite vilissimo, saith Houeden, out of the Castle of Burwell in Cambridgeshire; of which wound, after certaine daies hee died, being at that time excommunicated. Lying at the point of death, ready to giue his last gaspe, Camd. in (saith Camden out of the Register booke of Walden) there came by chance certaine Knights Templars, who laid vpon him the habit of their religious profession, signed with a red crosse, and afterwards when he was full dead, taking him vp with them, enclosed him within a coffin of lead, and hung him vpon a tree in the Orchard of the old Temple at London, in the yeare 1144. for in a re∣uerend awe of the Church, they durst not bury him, because he died ex∣communicated, so fearefull in those daies was the sentence of excommuni∣cation: a violent inuader he was of other mens lands, and possessions, and therefore iustly incurred (saith the same Author) the worlds censure, and this heauy doome of the Church: but I must leaue him, where buried, or where not buried, God knowes. As the Church of this monasterie was honoured with the funerall mo∣numents of the Mandeuills, so was it with those of the Bohuns, Earles of Hereford and Essex, of which you may reade in the Catalogues of Nobi∣lity. It was also honoured with the Sepulture of Humfrey Plantaginet, Earle of Buckingham, (the onely sonne of Thomas Earle of Buckingham, and Duke of Glocester, commonly called Thomas of Woodstocke, the yongest sonne of King Edward the third) who (after the vntimely death of his father) was banished into Ireland by King Richard the second, and being recalled backed againe by King Henry the fourth, in the first yeare of his raigne, in his returne died of the plague in Chester, from whence, his mother Elianor daughter and coheire of Humfrey de Bohun Earle of Hereford, Essex, and Northampton, caused his body to be conueyed to this Abbey, which shee sumptuously here interred, amongst his and her noble progenitors; his mother, the said Elianor, liued not long after him, but died the third of October in the same yeare, as in a French Inscription vpon her monument in Westminster you may reade; and scarce two yeares after the murder of her husband at Callis; of whose deaths thus writeth that old Poet Sir Iohn Gower Knight, in his booke intituled Vox Clamantis. Interea transit moriens nec in orbe remansit, Humfredus dictus redit ille Deo benedictus. Defuncto nato cito post de fine beato Mater transiuit, dum nati funera sciuit.

Little Easton. Will. Bourchier , Earle of Ewe. Here is a goodly Tombe of marble on the north side of the Chancell, nder which saith Brooke, in his Catalogue of Nobility, William Bourchier Earle of Ewe in Normandy lyeth interred; but Vincent, (whom I rather be∣leeue) (in his discouery of Brookes Errors) approues this Earle, as also his wife Anne (the daughter of Thomas of Woodstocke Duke of Glocester) to be buried in the Abbey of Lanthonie by Gloucester. If this monument could speake like others by her inscription, it might haply decide the con∣trouersie: but all the words vpon it are, Fili Dei miserere mei, Mater Dei miserere mei. Which seemingly commeth by a labell from a man, and a woman thereupon pourtraied. Of this Earle more when I come to Lan∣thony. Betweene the Chancell and the Bowsers Isle or Chappell, Hen. Bourchier E. of Essex. is a very cost∣ly arched Tombe of polished marble, inlaid with brasse, the picture of a man and a woman, and in diuers places of the foresaid Arch, on the wo∣mans side, is the Fetter lock and Bowsers knot, but without inscription. By supposition made to the memorie of Henry Bourchier (sonne of William Bourchier aforesaid, Earle of Essex and Ewe ; and Isabell his wife, daughter of Richard Earle of Cambridge, and sister of Richard Duke of Yorke. Which Henry died quarto Aprilis, 1483. a valiant and worthie Nobleman he was, fortunate in Martiall enterprises; and in matters of peace so learn∣ed, wise, and politicke, that he was thought fit by Edward the fourth to be Lord Chancellour of England. In the same Chappell, Hen. Bourchier E. of Essex. on the North side, remaineth a very faire Al∣tar Tombe of marble, within the which lyeth the body of Henry Lord Bourchier and Louaine, and Earle of Essex, Sonne and heire of William Bourchier, that died before his father, and grandchilde to Henry Earle of Essex, next before mentioned: ouer his Tombe hangeth as yet part of his achieuements, as the cote of his Armes, Helme, Crest, and sword. This Earle brake his necke by a fall from his horse, the twelfth day of March, in the one and thirtieth yeare of the raigne of King Henry the eight, 1539. His horse was young, saith Stow, Stow Annal. and he the oldest Earle in England: for if you will reckon the yeares from the death of his Grandfather, who liued after his sonne, the father of this Henry (as I haue said before) vntill the yeare of this his fatall misfortune, you shall finde them to be fifty sixe; and what age he was at his Grandfathers death you may imagine: In the Hall of the Mannor house of Newton, Out of certaine ancient colle∣ctions in Essex. in the Parish of little Dun∣mowe, remaineth in old painting two postures; the one for an ancestor of the Bourchiers, combatant with another, being a Pagan king, for the truth of Christ; whom the said Englishman ouercame, and in memory thereof his descendants haue euer since borne the head of the said Infidell, as also vsed the surname of Bourchier or Bowser. Here are foure wondrous ancient Monuments of the Louaines, all the Inscriptions of them are worne out, these few words excepted. Sire Thomas Louaine ici gist Margarie la file Moun.... Sir Tho.

Who being sent hither to keepe the honor of Eye his posterity flourished among the Peeres of this Realme, to the time of Edward the third: when the heire generall was married to the house of Bourchier.

The treble Bell in the steeple of this Church is called the Bowsers Bell, on which is cast a peece of coine of siluer, of King Edward the fourth; it was giuen by one of the Countesses of Essex, as one may partly gather by an old Inscription; vpon it is the Bowsers knot. Tiltey. The foundati∣on of Tiltey Abbey. Here sometime stood a Monastery founded by Maurice Fitz-Gilbert, before remembred, not long after the Conquest, which he dedicated to the honour of the Virgine Mary, and therein placed white Monkes of the Ci∣stertian order. The donations to this religious house are confirmed in the Records of the Tower, Cart. Antiq. lit. S. The valuation of it at the suppression was 177. l. 9: s. 4. d.

Iuga the wife of one Baynard, The founda∣tion of the Pri¦ory of Dun∣mow. a Nobleman, that came in with the Con∣querour; the builder of Baynards Castle in London, founded the Priority in this village, in the beginning of the raigne of Henry Beauclerke, and entrea∣ted Mauricius, Out of an ab∣stract of the Chronicle of Dunmow, in b b. Cott. Bishop of London, to dedicate the Church to the honour of the virgine Mary, to which, the same day, she gaue halfe a Hide of land. Her sonne and heire Geffrey Baynard placed blacke Chanons therein, by the consent of Anselme Archbishop of Canterbury. This house was valued at the suppression to be yearely worth 173. l. 2. s. 4. d. Matilda surna¦med the faire. The Church of this monastery is as yet standing, in the Quire whereof, betweene two pillars, lieth the body of Matilda the faire entombed, who was the daughter of Robert Fitz-water, the most valiant knight of Eng∣land. About the yeare 1213. saith the booke of Dunmow, there arose a great discord betwixt king Iohn and his Barons, because of Matilda surnamed the faire, daughter of Robert Fitz-water, whom the King vnlawfully loued, but could not obtaine her, nor her fathers consent thereunto. Whereupon, and for other like causes, ensued warre through the whole Realme. The king banished the said Fitz-water amongst other, and caused his Castle, called Baynard, and other his houses to be spoiled. Which being done, he sent a messenger vnto Matilda the faire, Ex predict. lib Dunmow. Stow Annal. about his old Suit in Loue, Et quia noluit consentire toxicauit eam. And because she would not agree to his wicked motion, the messenger poisoned a boiled, or potched Egge, against she was hungrie, and gaue it vnto her, whereof she died, the yeare 1213. In the yeare following after her death, her banished father was restored to the kings fauour, vpon this occasion. It happened in the yeare 1214. king Iohn being then in France, Stow. Annal. with a great armie, that a truce was taken betwixt the two Kings of England and France, for the terme of fiue yeares: and a riuer or arme of the Sea, being betwixt either host, there was a knight in the English host, that cried to them of the other side, willing some one of their knights, to come and iust a course or two with him. Wherupon with∣out stay Robert Fitz-water, being on the French part, made himselfe ready, ferried ouer, & got on horseback, and shewed himself ready to the face of his challenger, whom at the first course, he stroke so hard with his great speare, that horse and man fell to the ground; and when his Speare was broken, he went backe againe to the king of France. Which king Iohn seeing, by Gods tooth, quoth he, (such was his vsuall oath) hee were a King indeed, that had such a knight. The friends of Robert hearing these his words, kneeled downe, and said, O king he is your knight, it is Robert Fitz-water ; Sir Rob. Fitz-water knight. where∣upon the next day he was sent for, and restored to the kings fauour. By which meanes peace was concluded, and he receiued his liuings, and had licence to repaire his Castle of Baynard, and all his other Castles. After which, this strenuous knight, this Mars of men, this Marshall of Gods Armie and holy Church (for so he was enstiled, by the common multitude) liued in all affluence of riches and honour, the space of sixteene yeares; de∣ceased in the yeare 1234. and lieth here entombed by his daughter. Thus saith the booke, Extract. lib. Dunmow. in saepe dict. bib. Cott. Ann. 1234.

The inheritance and honours of this famous, and right noble race of the Fitz-waters, came at length by mariage into the stocke of the Radcliffes, for (in the pedegree of Sir Alexander Radcliffe of Ordsall in the county of Lancaster, knight of the Bath; descended, as the Earle of Sussex is, from the Radcliffes, anciently of Radcliffe in the said County; the sonne of that valiant and generally beloued Gentleman, Sir Iohn Radcliffe, Lieuetenant Colonell, slaine, fighting against the French, in the Isle of Rhee, the 29. day of October, in the yeare of our Lord, one thousand sixe hundred, twenty and seuen) I finde that Sir Iohn Radcliffe Knight, (sonne of Sir Iohn Rad∣cliffe knight, who married Katherine, the daughter and heire of Edward Lord Burnell of Acton Burnell in the county of Salop) married Elizabeth, the daughter and heire of Walter, Lord Fitz-water, of Woodham, a Ba∣ron of great riches, as of ancient nobility, the father of Iohn, who was Fa∣ther of Robert Radcliffe, the first of that sirname, Earle of Sussex, Viscount Fitz-water, Lord Egremont and Burnell, who with other two Earles, his Sonne and Grandchilde, lie here interred vnder a sumptuous monument, as appeareth by their seuerall inscriptions and liuely portraitures. To the memory of the first Earle (for I am tied by my method onely to his at this time) these funerall lines following are engrauen. Robertus Radcliffe miles Dominus Fitz-water, Ro.

By Margaret his second wife, daughter of Thomas Lord Stanley, Earle of Darby, he had Anne, married to Thomas Lord Wharton, who lieth here buried by her father, and Iane maried to Sir Antony Browne, Knight, Viscount Mountague. By his third wife, the daughter of Sir Iohn Arundell of Lanherne in Cornwall, Knight; he had issue, Sir Iohn Radcliffe, Knight, who died without issue, in the yeare 1566. and lieth buried in Saint Olaues Hart-streete, London. Henry Radcliffe, Earle of Sussex, sonne of this Robert as aforesaid, was one of the priuie Councell to Queene Mary, as I finde it in her Grant of li∣berty made vnto him for the wearing of Coyfes or Cappes in her presence, which I coppied out of the Originall amongst the Euidences of Robert late Earle of Sussex deceased; expressed in these words following.

This Henry, departed this life at Sir Henry Sidneyes house in Chanon Row at Westminster, on wednesday morning, the 17. of February, be∣tweene fiue and sixe a clocke, in the third and fourth yeare of Philip and Mary, Anno 1556. as Vincent in his Discouerie of Brookes Errors verifieth by a certificate thereof in the booke of Burials in the Office of Armes, Fol. 225. He was buried first by his Father, in Saint Laurence Poultney Church in London, from whence their remaines were remoued hither, as you shall vnderstand by the present sequele. That braue-spirited politicke-wise Lord, Thomas Earle of Sussex, Lord Chamberlaine of the Houshold to Queene Elizabeth of famous memory, built, or began to build a Chappell in this Church, wherein this glorious Tombe is erected, as a place of buriall for himselfe and his worthy proge∣ny; and commanded by his last Will and Testament (as I was told) that the honourable remaines of his Father, and Grandfather Henry, and the foresaid Robert, Earles of Sussex, should be remoued from the parish Church of Saint Laurence Poultney London, where their bodies lay buried, to this his Chapbell at Boreham, wherein hee desired to be entombed: all which was accordingly performed. This Tombe was made by one Richard Ste∣phens, an outlandish man, and finished with all furniture, as gilding, colou∣ring, and the like, thereunto belonging, the xxviii. of May, M.D. lxxxxix. the whole charge thereof amounting to the summe of cclxxxxii.l. xii. s. viii. d. as appeares by the account which I haue seene. This Thomas, Earle of Sussex, saith Camden, was a most worthy and honourable personage, in whose minde were seated ioyntly both politicke wisedome, and martiall prowesse, as England and Ireland acknowledged; but more of him hereaf∣ter. These Earles of Sussex of this sirname, from Robert the first, to Robert the last, who died An. Dom. 1629. haue euer beene Knights of the Garter. Tho. Coggeshall and Ioane his wife.

This Collegiate Church was founded by Thomas of Woodstocke, The Foundati∣on of the Col∣ledge at Duke of Glocester, for Canons regular: which was valued in the Kings bookes to be yearely worth one hundred thirty nine pounds three shillings ten pence. The vpper part of which Church, within these few yeares, was taken downe; and as I was told in the Towne, the Parishioners (being either vn∣willing or vnable to repaire the decayes) carried away the materials which were employed to other vses. This part of the Church was adorned and beautified with diuers rich funerall Monuments, which were hammered a peeces, bestowed, and diuided, according to the discretion of the Inhabi∣tants. Vpon one of the parts of a dismembred Monument, carelesly cast here and there in the body of the Church, I found these words. Here lyeth Iohn Holland, Io. Holland Earle of Exce∣ter.

From which dignitie he was deposed, by Act of Parliament in the first yeare of King Henry the fourth, whose sister he had married: and in the same yeare beheaded in this Towne for a seditious conspiracie (saith Camden ) and in the very place where the Duke of Glocester was arrested by King Richard, Camd. in Essex. which was in the base court of the Castle of Pleshie (now quite ruined) that he might seeme (saith he) to haue beene iustly punished by way of satisfaction, for the foresaid Duke of Glocester; of whose death he was thought to be the principall procurer. He was beheaded the third day after the Epiphanie, 1399. 1. Hen. 4. Vpon a broken peece of a faire marble stone, reared to the side of a pil∣lar, whereupon were the pictures in brasse of an armed knight and his La∣dy, this ensuing disticke was engrauen.

Vnder this stone (if Tradition may go for truth) Sir Edward Holland, Earle of Mortaigne, sonne of the foresaid Iohn Holland, beheaded; with his Lady were entombed. Orate pro anima Iohannis Scot, Io.

But I shall forget the Founder Thomas of Woodstocke, the sixth sonne of King Edward the third, and Vncle to King Richard, who was taken by force from this his Castle of Plessy, by Thomas Mowbray, Earle Marshall, and conuayed to Callis, where he was smothered vnder a Featherbed, 1397. His body was afterwards conueyed with all funerall pompe into England, and buried here in this Church of his owne foundation, Hollins. p. 489. in a goodly sepul∣chre prouided by himselfe in his life time. Whose reliques were afterwards remoued and laid vnder a marble, inlaid with brasse, in the Kings Chappell at Westminster.

Cygnus patitur de Corde benignus, Ille prostratus non est de Rege levatus, Ad Plessye captus tunc est velut Hostia raptus Rex jubet arma geri, nec eo voluit misereri; Cum Sponsa nati lugent quasi morti gravati; Plusque Lupo sevit Rex dummodo Femina flevit. Nil pietas munit quem tunc manus invida punit, Rex stetit obliquus nec erat tunc unus amicus. O Regale genus, Princeps quasi pauper egenus, Turpiter attractus jacet et sine iure subactus. Sunt ibi Fautores Regis de sorte Priores Qui Cygnum pendent, vbi captum ducere tendent, Sic ducendo ducem, perdit sine lumine lucem. Anglia que tota tenebrescit luce remota; Trans mare natavit, regnum qui semper amavit; Flent centum mille quia Cygnus preterit ille, Calisij portus petit unde dolus latet ortus, Error quem Regis genuit putredine legis Carcere conclusus subito fuit ille reclusus, Nescit quo fine, sit vite, sive ruine Tunc Rex elatum sumpsit quasi Falco volatum, Vnde suas gentes perdit Custode carentes. A little after follow these verses, touching the deniall of buriall to bee granted vnto him among the rest of his honourable and royall Ancestors. Sic nece devictum, sic corpus ab hoste relictum, Clam de conclavi susceperat Anglia navi, Per mare regreditur, corpus nec adhuc sepelitur, Namque sepulturam, defendit Rex sibi puram; Desuper a latere patris loca justa tenere, Dummodo quesivit vix bassa sepulchra subivit. Of the manner of his death these three verses following. Hen quam tortorum quidam de sorte malorum, Sic Ducis electi plumarum pondere lecti, Corpus quassatum jugulant que necant jugulatum. Such was the end of this royall Prince, sonne to a King, and vncle to a King: who by our writers is discommended in this, that he was euer repi∣ning against the King in all things whatsoeuer he wished to haue forward: Histor Ang. l. 20. Erat enim vir ferocissimus & precipitis ingenij (as Polidor censures him) a most fierce man, and of an headlong wit; who thinking still that those times, wherein he had mastred the King, were nothing changed, though the King was aboue thirty yeeares old, forbare not, roughlie, not so much to admonish, as to check and schoole his Soueraigne. Hatfield Peuerell. So denominated of one Randolph Peuerell the owner thereof, to whom Edward the Confessor was very munificent for that hee had married his kinswoman, Camd. in Essex the daughter of Ingelrick, a man of great Nobilitie among the English Saxons. A Lady of that admirable beautie, that with her lookes she conquered the Conquerour William, who desired nothing more then to be her prisoner in Armes, which to effect, hee begins to expresse a kinde of loue to the remembrance of her deceased father Ingelrick, enriching the Colledge of Saint Martins le grand in London, first founded by him and her vncle Edward, hee honours and aduanceth her two brethren, William Peuerell Castellane or Keeper of Douer Castle, and Payne Peuerell Baron of Bourne or Brun, in Cambridgeshire, the founder of Barnwell Abbey; Stan¦dard bearer to Robert Duke of Normandy in the holy warre against Infi∣dels. He prefers her kindred and friends, he sollicites her by the messen∣gers of the Deuils Bedchamber, his slie enchanting Bawdes, and comes sometimes himselfe like Iupiter in a golden shower. Thus by these forcible demonstrations of his loue, and vnauoidable allurements (especially from a King) shee was brought at length to his vnlawfull bed, vnto whom shee bare a sonne named William, who was Lord of Nottingham, the founder of Lenton Abbey. His mother (toucht with remorse of conscience for her sinnes) to expiate her guilt (for such was the doctrine taught in those daies) founded a Colledge here in this village of Hatfield, The foundati∣on Hatfield Colledge. which shee consecrated to the honour of God, and S. Mary Magdelen ; wherein, setting apart all worldlie employments, she spent the remainder of her dayes, and here de∣parted her life about the yeere 1100. sixteene yeeres after the death of the Conquerour. Here she lieth buried, and her image or portraiture cut in stone is to be seene at this present day in the Church window.

The foundati∣on of Wal∣tham Abbey. For within the compasse of a yeare, hee lost both his life and his kingdome, at one cast, and both of them to a Stranger; I meane Harold the second, the sonne of Earle Godwin. Who hauing built and sufficiently endowed this his Foundation, for a Deane, and eleuen secu∣lar blacke Canons, he caused it to bee consecrated, to the honour of a cer∣taine holy Crosse, Waltham Crosse. found farre Westward, and brought hither by miracle. King Henry the second new builded this Monastery, and placed therein Regular Canons; augmenting their number to foure and twenty, and also their reuenues. Richard Cordelion his sonne confirmes the gift and ex∣change of the Canons made by his father, by his Charter to be read in the Tower, in these words. Richardus Dei gratia, &c. Inde est, quod sicut Pater noster mutationem Canonicorum secularium, Cart. Ant. Litur.

Herein Harold made his vowes, and prayers, for victorie when hee marched against the Norman Conquerour. In which battell by the shot of an arrow through the left eye into his braines, he was slaine the 14. of October, being Saturday, 1066. hauing raigned nine moneths and odde dayes: whose body by the mediation of his mother Gi∣tha, and two religious men of this Abbey, being obtained of the Conque∣rour (howsoeuer at the first by him denyed, affirming that buriall was not fit for him, whose ambition had beene the cause of so many funeralls) was conueyed (with great lamentation) by his said mother Githa, The buriall of King Harold. and a small deiected remainder of the English Nobilitie, to this his owne Church, and herein solemnly interred, vpon whose Monument this Epitaph was en∣grauen. Heu cadis hosle sero, Rex, a Duce Rege sutaro Par paris gladio, milite & valido. Firmini iusti lux est tibi, luce Calixti; Pronior hinc superas, hinc superatus eras.

As for me, if you will commit the charge to me, I will performe both the part of a kinde brother, and a couragious Leader. For being cleare in conscience, I shall sell my life, or discomfit your enemy with more felicitie. But the King not liking his speech, answered, I will neuer turne my back, with dishonour, to the Norman, neither can I in any sort digest the reproach of a base minde: well then be it so (said some discontented of the company) let him beare the brunt that hath giuen the occasion.

Mat ad an 12 0. the truth is, that Hugh Nevill a gentleman of noble linage, one of King Richards speciall familiars, is recorded to haue slaine a Lion in the holy Land, driuing first an arrow into his breast, and then running him thorow with his sword, whereupon this Hexameter was made. Viribus Hugonis vires periere Leonis. The strength of Hugh a Lion slue. Which atchiuement belike was transferred from the man to the master, and the story applied to the by-name of K.

I finde, in Registro Cartarum Abbatie de Waltam, that these two Nevils were great benefactors to this Monasterie, to which Hugh Nevill afore∣said, gaue by his deed the Mannor of Thorndon, in these words, Omnibus ad quos, &c.

He was Arch∣deacon of Lewes, Dannil. in vil. Hen 3. and for his good seruice in this businesse (Kings haue e∣uer such seruants to expresse their pleasures in what course soeuer they take) he should haue bin preferred to the Bishoprick of Chichester; but the Bishops withstanding the King therein, his election was disanuld in the yeare 1234. being (with other) called to a strict account for the Kings Treasure ill spent, Paris. or worse employed, he was constrained to take Sanctu∣arie, and seeke odde corners for his safety; yet afterwards (an argument of the Kings lenitie) he was receiued into grace and fauour: at the length lea∣uing the troubles which attend the Court, hee liued priuately at his parso∣nage of Derham in Norfolke, but died at his house here in Waltham vpon the sixt day of Iune, in the yeare 1252. of whom will it please you heare Mathew Paris speake in his owne language.

This Monasterie is now one of the mansion houses of that honourable Lord, Sir Edward Denny Knight, Baron Denny of Waltham, and Earle of Norwich. I found since I writ the premisses, that Edward the Confessour was the prime cause of this religious foundation, for that he gaue to Harold certaine Lands here conditionally that hee should thereupon build a Monasterie, and furnish it with all necessaries, as appeares by his Charter of that dona∣tion amongst the Records in the Tower.

This towne of Vpmenster or Vpminster, as it is diuersly written, lying three miles from Rumpford, requireth some large remembrance from mee, in respect that it hath enioyed within little more then the space of three hundred yeares, diuers eminent families, who haue beene Lords of the same, or at least of the Mannor of Gains, called also the Mannor of Vp∣menster, lying within the same; to which mannor, as long tradition hath left to posteritie, there is a little Isle or Chappell, standing on the north side of the Chancell of the same Church, belonging, and time out of minde, ap∣pendant to the Mannor of Gains aforesaid, and appropriated to the Lords of the same for their particular place of buriall for themselues and their issue. The first familie (of whose posteritie I can dilate) which I finde to haue beene Lords of the said mannor of Gains, alias Vpmenster, was that most ancient sirname of Engaine (whether thence drawne or no, I leaue to others to coniecture) and it is warranted by a long tradition that Sir Iohn Engain Knight, the sonne of Vitalis Engayn being Ex Autographo eiusdem carie dat an. 2 E 1. penes Radul∣phum Lathum A m g domi∣num Mancrie eiusdem. Lord of the said mannor, did build the before mentioned Chappell, which since hath receiued its deno∣mination from the blessed Virgin. This familie ended in the male line, when Sir Thomas Engayne Knight, sonne of Iohn Engayne Esquire, and grand∣childe to the former Sir Iohn, left his three daughters, his coheirs, of whom Iocosa the eldest was wife of Iohn de Goldington. Elizabeth the second, was married to Sir Lawrence de Pakenham knight: & Mary the third daughter & coheire, Escaetr. de. a. 41. E. 3. was wife of Sir William de Barnake knight. There is no Tombe or grauestone left of this familie, but onely their Coatarmour in the East win∣dow of the aforesaid Chappell. This Mannor of Gains, alias Vpmenster, was afterwards seuerally in the possession of Symon de Hauering ( Ex Autogra∣pho eiusdem cartae dat. 10. Iulij, a. 15. E. 1. penes R. L. prae∣dictum. who I conceiue was but the Feoffe in trust of Sir Iohn the sonne and heire of Iohn Engayne ) of Alice de Perrers, Rot Pat. de a. 3. R. 2. parte 3. afterwards attainted by Act of Parliament in a. 1. R. 2. and of Henry de la Felde, whose further mention leauing the first two in silence, serueth onely to this present Narration. The said Henry de la Felde did by his Deede indented, a. 9. H 4. entaile the said mannour vpon Richard, Penes Rad. Lath, praedict. Walter, and Iohn his sonnes, each after o∣ther vpon the default of issue; and lastly, vpon Iohn Deincourt and Eliza∣beth his wife, the daughter of the said Henry de la Felde, in whose right af∣terwards it should seeme he came to be Lord thereof; and there lieth buried together, with his wife, vnder a faire Tombe, placed iust vnder the Arch which diuideth the said north Chappell or Isle from the Chancell of Vp∣menster Church. Es testis Christe quod non iacet hic lapis iste Corpus vt ornetur sed spiritus vt memoretur. And about the tombe, though somewhat mutilated is written this Epi∣taph. Sancte deus sancte fortis sancte miserecors saluator miserere: Animabus Ro∣geri Dencourt Armigeri & Elizabeth consortis sue quorum corpora sub isto lapide marmoreo tumulantur ac etiam orate In this place tis probable the words to be supplied are Pro animabus filiorum suorum et. :::::::::::: Filiarum suarum qui quidem Rogerus obijt vicesimo :::::::: An.

Nec non orate pro animabus omnium ::::::::: defunctorum hic & vbique in Christo quiescencium: The next owner of this mannor of a new sirname, I finde to haue beene Nicholas Wayte, of whom or his familie, I can say little; onely by his sale it came to be the inheritance of Ralph Lathum Esquire, a lyneall descendant in the male line, from a yonger branch of the ancient familie of Lathom of Lancashire, who were Lords of that place in the said Countie (as all the receiued descents of that familie warrant) from the time of King R. 1. vntill the latter end of E. 3. when Isabel the sole daughter and heire of Sir Thomas Lathom Knight, was married to Sir Iohn Stanlye knight, from whom the now earle of Darbie is lineally descended, and (as I conceiue) is from the right of this intermarriage, Lord of the Mannor of Lathom at this day. The Epitaph of this aboue said Ralph Lathom, is placed in brasse, set into a faire marble stone, couering his tombe, and is as followeth. Here lieth buried Rayff Lathum esquire, late Lord of Vpmistre, and She was the daughter of Sir Wi liam Roche Knight. E∣lizabeth his wife, which Rayffe deceased the xix. day of Iuly, An. M.ccccc.Lvii. whose soule and all christen soules Iesus haue mercy. The next familie to whom by the sale of William Lathom, sonne and heire of the aforesaid Ralfe Lathom, the before mentioned Mannor of Gains did appertaine, was the familie of D'Ewes, (from whom also it was a∣gain at last repurchased by Lathom ) for Adrian D'Ewes being descended of the ancient stem of Des Ewes, Dynasts or Lords of the Dition of Kessell in the Dutchie of Gelderland, setling and marrying in England not many yeares after the beginning of the raigne of King H. 8. had issue, Gerardt D'Ewes his sonne and heire, who hauing purchased the said Mannor of Gains as aforesaid, was after his death, according to the former vsage, buri∣ed in the said Chappell, appendant to the said Mannor, as other Lords of the same had beene, whose Epitaph, because it is replenished with many particulars touching the antiquity and ensignes of this familie.

In the same are other Man∣nors exceeding ancient: as that of Clarendon Hall, the old seat of the Chanceux, Sir Giles Chan∣ceux many of them were knights; as Sir Giles Chanceux, in Edward the first his time; many of them lie buryed in the Church, with their Pictures, Scutcheons, and French Poesies all defaced. Another Mannor called Breamstons, or rather Beanstons, honoured by knights, descended of Bartholomew a yonger sonne to the Earle of Ewe in Normandy; it hath beene inhabited by a knight or more of the name of Scot.

So many Lordships in the parish haue caused so many of their owners to honour this Church with their Sepultures, but to whose memory, in par∣ticular, any one of these monuments were erected, cannot bee discerned, they are all so shamefully abused.

Now here I haue iust occasiō giuen me, to set down the manner of the cre∣ation or crowning of Garter, principal K. of Arms, & of Clarentieux & Nor∣roy, Prouinciall Kings of Armes; as also the creation of Heralds, & Pursui∣uants of Armes: which anciently was done by the King, but of later times is performed by the Earle Marshall, hauing an especiall Commission therefore signed by the King for euery particular Creation. And first I will begin with Garter, and shew what necessaries are to be prouided for him, at the time he shall be crowned, which are these following. A Booke and a Sword to be sworne vpon. A Crowne guilt. A Collar of Esses▪ A Bowle of wine, which Bowle is fee to the new created King. And a Coat of Armes of veluet richly enbroydered. The creation or crowning of Garter, as well anciently as in these daies, was, and is on this manner. I will instance with Sir Gilbert Dethick knight, who was created Garter principall king of Armes, on Sunday the twentieth day of Aprill, in the fourth of Ed. the sixt. First, the said Garter kneeled downe before the Kings maiestie, and the Kings Sword was holden on a booke, and the said Garter laid his hand vpon the booke, and also vpon the sword, whiles Clarentieux, king of armes, read the oath. And when the oath was red, and the said Garter had kissed the booke and the sword, then the said Clarentieux read the let∣ters patents of his office; (which were dated the 29. of April in the yeare aforesaid) In the reading whereof, as the words doe follow in order, so did the Kings maiestie first take the cup of wine, and pouring it on his head, named him Garter. After that, his Maiestie put on him his coat of Armes, and the collar of SS about his neck, and lastly the crowne vpon his head, and so finished the ceremony. The oath of Garter principall King of armes at a Chapter holden at Greenwich in the 28 yeare of King Henry the eight. Ye shall take the oath that ye shall obey first of all the supreme head of this most noble Order, and after him, the other knights of the same, namely, in such things as shall belong to your office, and shall bee found reasonable. And because ye be taken in here, as to be priuie of counsell here to bee ta∣ken. Ye shall sweare that ye shall be a man of silence, true and faithfull in all things here to be done, and shall in no wise disclose any part thereof. Ye shall sweare also, that yee shall faithfully and diligently, fulfill per∣forme and execute such things as shall be committed, put in credit, or charge vnto you. And ye shall diligently enquire of all noble and notable acts of any, and of euery of the Knights of this most noble Order; and yee shall certifie the Register thereof, that he may the better describe and com∣mend the same to memory. Moreouer, if any Knight of this order die, yee shall incontinent vpon knowledge thereof, cause the Soueraigne, and after him the other Knights, then aliue, to be ascertayned thereof. And finally, ye shall sweare, that ye shall truly and faithfully, vse and ex∣ercise this same your office. So God you helpe, and this holy Euangely. The creation of the Prouinciall Kings of Armes, viz. Claren∣cieux and Norroy, for which are to be prouided. First, his Letters Patents. Item, a Booke to take his oath vpon. Item, a Sword, which is to be drawne, and laid crosse on the booke. Item, a Crowne, which must be set on his head. Item, a Collar of SS about his neck. Item, a Bowle of wine, which must bee poured on his head, and that Bowle is fee to the new created King. Item, a Coat of Armes of Veluet richly embrodered. The manner of the creation of a Prouinciall King of Armes. He shall be brought into the presence of the King, or his Earle Mar∣shall, or the Earle Marshals Deputie, by the two other Kings, all the He∣ralds and Pursuiuants following. Then he kneeleth downe, while Garter readeth the articles of his oath, holding his hand vpon a booke and sword. That done, he kisseth the booke, and hilts of the sword. Then his patent is read by an Herald, and as the words following bee read, his Coat is first put on by the King, his Marshall or Deputy, then the Collar of SS put a∣about his necke, then the Crowne on his head, and lastly the Bowle of wine poured on his head, calling him by his name, as Clarencieux, or Norroy. 1 Investimus—tunica Armorum. 2 Erigimus—Collari. 3 Coronamus—appositione Corone. 4 Et nomen ei imponimus N. The Oath of the King of Armes at the time when he shall be crowned. Ye shall sweare by the Oath that ye receiued when yee were created He∣rald, and by the faith that ye owe vnto the King our Soueraigne Lord, whose Armes you beare, that you shall truly keepe such things as bene comprised in these articles following. First, whensoeuer the King shall command you to doe any message to a∣ny other King, Prince, Estate, or any other person out of this Realme; or to any person, of what Estate, degree, or condition he bee of within the same, that ye shall doe it as honourablie and truly as your wit and reason can serue you; And as greatly to the aduentage of our Soueraigne Lord the King, and this his Realme, and true report bring againe to his High∣nesse of your messages, and as neere to the charge to you committed, in word, and in substance, as your said reason may attaine vnto. Alway kee∣ping your selfe secret for any manner of motion, saue to such persons as ye be commanded to vtter your charge vnto. Secondly, ye shall doe your true deuoir euery day to be more cunning then other in the office of Armes, so that ye may bee the better furnished to teach other in the office of Armes vnder you, and execute with more wisdome and eloquence, such charges as our Soueraigne Lord, or any No∣bleman of his Realme, shall lay vnto you, by vertue of the office the which his Highnesse will elect you to at this time. Discouering in no wise that ye are charged to keepe close, vnlesse it be preiudiciall vnto the King our Soueraigne Lord, and to his Realme. Thirdly, ye shall doe your full diligence to haue knowledge of all the Noble Gentlemen within your Marches, which should beare coates in the field, in the seruice of our Soueraigne Lord, his Liuetenants, Officers, or Commissioners, and them with their Issues truly to register, and such Armes as they beare with their differences due in Armes to bee giuen, and to enquire if any of them hold by any seruice, as by Knights Fee, whereby they should doe the King our Soueraigne Lord seruice in the defence of this his Realme, which also ye shall truly and indifferently note and register. Fourthly, ye shall not be strange to teach Pursuiuants or Heralds, ne to ease them in such doubts concerning the office of Armes as they shall moue you vnto, and such as cannot be eased by you, ye shall shew to the Consta∣ble or Marshall; or if any Pursuiuant aske any doubt of you, yee shall aske him first whether he haue desired any of the Heralds to instruct him in the same; and if hee say nay, ye shall limit him to one of them, or ease him if you can. And if you cannot, to moue the said cause at the next Chapter, and if the said doubt be not there determined, by the said Chapter, then to shew it to the Constable or Marshall. Also ye shall keepe duly in your Mar∣ches (if ye be present in the precincts thereof) your Chapters, to the encrease of cunning in the office of Armes, and the doubts that there cannot bee ea∣sed, ye shall moue vnto the Constable or Marshall. Fiftly, ye shall obserue and keepe to your cunnning and power, all such Oathes as ye made when ye were created Herald, to the honour and wor∣ship of Nobles, and integritie of liuing. Namely, in eschuing of dislande∣red places and persons reproached, and to bee more ready to excuse then to blame any Noble person, vnlesse ye be charged to say the sooth by the King, Constable, or Marshall, in place Iudiciall. And also yee shall promise truly to register all acts of honour in manner and forme as they bee done, as farre forth as your cunning and power may extend. So help you God and the holy Euangeles, and by the crosse of this Sword, that longeth to Knighthode. Necessaries to be prouided for the Creation of an Herald of Armes. First, a Booke, whereon he must take his oath: Item, a Sword, which must be drawne. Item, his Letters Patents, which must be read by an Officer. Item, a Collar of SS of siluer, to put about his neck. Item, a Bowle of wine to poure vpon his head, which Bowle the new Herald is to haue. Item, his Coat of Armes, which must be Satten embroydered, and en∣riched with gold. The manner of the Heralds creation. The Herald of Armes is brought into the presence of the King or his Earle Marshall, or the Earle Marshals Deputy, by two of the eldest He∣ralds, the Kings of Armes going before them, and all the Heralds and Pur∣suiuants following, all making their due reuerence. Then hee kneeleth downe, and his oath being read by Garter, he sweareth to the contens by kissing both the Booke and crosse of the Sword hilt. The Patent is read by one of the Heralds, and at Investimus, the king or the Earle Marshall tur∣neth the Coat Sleeues to the sides, and putteth the Collar of SS about his neck, whereby he is created an Esquire; but of late times the Coate is car∣ried in by an Herald of Armes, and after by him presented to the Earle Marshall, who immediatly inuesteth the new Herald therewith; and at No∣men imponimus, he poureth the wine vpon his head, and calleth him by his name, as Lancaster, or otherwise, as his office doth require. The Oath of the Herald at the time of his cre∣ation before his Soueraigne. First, ye shall sweare that ye shall be true to the most high and mighty Prince the King, our Soueraigne Lord. And if you haue any knowledge, or heare any imagination of treason, or language, or words that might sound to the derogation or hurt of his estate and highnesse (which God defend) ye shall in that case as hastily, and as soone as it is to you possible, discouer and shew it vnto his highnesse, or to his noble and discreet Councell: and to conceale it in no wise. Also, ye shall promise and sweare that ye shall bee conuersant, and ser∣uiceable to all Gentlemen, to doe their commands to their worship and knighthood, by your good counsell that God hath sent you, and euer ready to offer your seruice vnto them. Also ye shall promise and sweare to be secret, and to keepe the secrets of Knights, Esquires, Ladies, and Gentlewomen, as a confessour of armes; and not to discouer them in any wise, except it bee for treason, as it is be∣fore said. Also ye shall promise and sweare, if fortune fall you in diuers Lands and Countries wherein you goe or ride, that you finde any gentleman of name, and of armes, that hath lost his goods in worship and knighthood, in the Kings seruice, or in any other place of worship, and is fallen into pouertie, ye shall aide, support, and succour him in that ye may, and if he aske you of your good to his sustenance, ye shall giue him part of such good as God hath sent you, to your power, and as you may beare. Also ye shall promise and sweare, if you be in any place, that you heare any language betweene party and party, that is not worshipfull, profitable, nor vertuous, that you keepe your mouth close, and report it not forth, but to their worship, and the best. Also ye shall promise and sweare, if so be you be in any place, that you heare any debate or language dishonest betweene gentleman and gentlewo∣man, the which ye be priuy to, if so be ye be required by Prince, Iudge, or any othere to beare witnesse, vnlesse that the law will needs compell you so to doe: you shall not without licence of both parties; and when yee haue leaue, ye shall not for any fauour, loue, or awe, but say the sooth to your knowledge. Also ye shall promise and sweare, to be true and secret to all gentlewo∣men, widdowes, and maydens, and in case that any man would doe them wrong, or force them, or disinherite them of their Liuelyhood, and they haue no good to pursue them for their right to Princes, or Iudges: if they require you of supportation, ye shall support them, with your good wise∣dome and counsell to Princes and Iudges. Also ye shall promise and sweare, that you shall forsake all places of dis∣honesty, the play of Hazardy, and the common haunt of going vnto Ta∣uernes, and other places of debates, eschuing vices, and taking you to ver∣tues to your power. This article, and all other articles aboue said, ye shall truly keepe, so God you helpe, and holydoome, and by this Booke, and Crosse of this Sword, that belongeth to Knighthood. Things necessarie to be prouided for the Creation of a Pursuiuant at Armes. First a Booke, whereon he must take his Oath. Item, his Letters Patents which must be read by an Officer. Item, His coat of Armes of Dammaske embroydered. Item, a Bowle of wine to be poured on his head, and that Bowle is to be taken by the new Pursuiuant of Armes. The manner of the Pursuiuants Creation. The Pursuiuant of armes shall be brought into the presence of the King, (or his Earle Marshall, or the Earle Marshals Deputy) betweene two of the eldest Pursuiuants, and kneele downe before him, laying his hand vpon the booke, Garter principall King of armes reads the oath vnder written; and so hee kisseth the booke. Then his letters Paten s shall bee read by an Herald, and when he saith Creamus, the King or the Earle Marshall put∣teth on his Coat of armes, with the sleeue before. And when he saith Nec non nomen vulgariter &c. the King or the Earle Marshall poureth the Bowle of wine vpon his head, calling him by his name, as Portcullis, or otherwise as his office requireth. The aduertisment and oath of a Pursuiuant of Armes at the time of his creation. First ye shall sweare that ye shall be true to the most high, most mighty, and most excellent Prince the King, our Soueraigne Lord. And if you haue any knowledge, or heare any imagination of treason, or language, or word, that shall sound to the derogation or hurt of his Estate and Highnesse (which God defend) ye shall in that case as hastily, and as soone, as it is to you possible, discouer and shew it to his Highnesse, or to his noble and discreet Counsell. Also ye shall dispose you to be lowly, humble, and seruiceable to all E∣states vniuersall that Christian bene, not lying in waite to blame, ne hurt none of the said Estates in any thing that may touch their honours. Also ye shall dispose you to bee secret and sober in your port, and not too busie in language, ready to commend, and loath to blame; and dili∣gent in your seruice, eschuing from vices, and taking you to vertues, and true in your reports, and so to exercise, while ye be in the Office of a Pur∣suiuant, that your merits may cause your more preferring in the Office of Armes in time comming. All such Articles and things as belongeth to a Pursuiuant of Armes to keepe, you shall well and truly obserue and keepe. So helpe you God, and Holydome, and by this Booke. A Catalogue shewing what Kings of Armes were in former Ages, and now out of vse in this Realme: as also the Succession of the Kings Heraulds, and Pursuiuants of Armes haue from ancient times to this present day succeeded one another. And first, The Succession of the principall Kings of Armes. GArter is the principall King of Armes (as I haue written before) and goeth first as the onely ring-leader of them all: Garter princi∣pall King of Armes. not so much for the an∣tiquitie of his Creation, as for the supereminence of the Order of the Gar∣ter: for he was but instituted by King Henry the fifth. His peculiar Office is (which partly you may reade in his oath) with all dutifull seruice to attend vpon the Knights of the Garter at their Solemnities: To aduertise them which are chosen of their new election, to call them to bee enstaulled at Windsore; To cause their Armes to be hanged vp vpon their Seates, and to marshall the Funerall Rites and Ceremonies of them, as also of the grea∣ter Nobilitie, as of Princes, Dukes, Marquesses, Earles, Viscounts, and Ba∣rons: and to do many other seruices vnto the King and State. The priuiledges of Garter King of Armes, his goods and Seruants as ap∣peareth in the Black▪booke of the most honourable Order of the Garter. Whereof this ancient institution following is enregistred. Hij tres hujus ordinis officiales Scriba, videlicet, Garterus Rex Armorum, & Hostiarius ab atra virga nuncupatus; ipsi cum suis tam rebus quam mi∣nistris in suis officijs permanentibus sub perpetua supremi protectione ac pro∣pugnaculo securè durabunt. Vnde si quaevis injuria seu violentia ipsis infera∣tur, vel ab eis qui supremo subjecti sunt, vel externis quoties causas suas arbi∣trio supremi submittent, ipse cū Sodalibus exhibebit eis iusticiam aut exhibē∣dam ex aequo et congruo procurabit. Si vero pars aduersa causam suam su∣premo submittere detractabit ipse cum Commilitonibus eum erga Officiales hos animum habebit, vt ipsorum causam quoad iustum at que aequum erit cum debito fauore tueri velit. Sir William Brugge or Brugges knight, In Arch. Turr. Lond. was the first King of the name Garter, in the raigne of Henry the fifth, as aforesaid; His Patent was confir∣med by Henry the sixth in the foure and twentieth yeare of his raigne, as it is in the Patent Rolls of that yeare, the eleuenth membrane. Iohn Smert succeeded Sir William Brugge in the said Office Patent, Ann. 39. Hen. 6. Member 14. In the fourteenth of Edward the fourth, he was imployed with a defiance to the French King Lewis the eleuenth; The which no little abashed the said King. Yet neuerthelesse following the said Officer of Armes directions, obtained by that meanes a Peace which he much coueted. And Edward the fourth as willingly assented, because he was deceiued by the Duke of Burgundy and the Constable of France, who failed him in their promised aides. The French King gaue vnto the said King of Armes vpon his returne three hundred French Crownes, and a peece of Veluet of thirty yard long. The next was Sir Iohn Wrythe or Wriothesley, here interred, and created as aforesaid. This Sir Iohn Wriothesley, Ann. 23. Edwardi quarti, was imployed into Scotland, and with him Northumberland Herauld, with letters of procu∣racie signed, and sealed by the King his master to redemand diuers great summes of money which had beene disbursed to Iames the third, King of Scots, vpon a promise of marriage entended to haue beene made betweene the Prince of Scotland, and Lady Cicily, daughter of King Edw. the fourth, who in that Treatie hauing the libertie of refusall, thereupon redemanded the foresaid summes by his said procuratours. Next to him Sir Thomas Wriothesley created in the time of Henry the seuenth. This Sir Tho. Wriothesley in the 19. of H. 8. was ioyned Embassadour with Viscount Lisle (the naturall sonne to King Edward the fourth) and others which carried the Garter to the French King Francis the first. He that succeeded him was Sir Thomas Wall, Knight, created Ann. 26. Hen. 8. Sir Christopher Baker Knight of the Bathe created Garter, Ann. 28. Hen. 8. 1536. Sir Gilbert Dethick Knight, was preferred to the Office of Garter, the fourth of Edward the sixth. He died in the yeare 1584. This Sir Gilbert Dethick was ioyned Embassadour with the Marquesse of Northampton, to carry the Garter to the French King Henry the second, Ann. 5. E. 6. And the like for the same purpose to the Prince of Pymont, with Edward Lord Clynton ; And also with the Lord Hunsden to the French King Charles the ninth: and with the Earle of Sussex) to the Empe∣rour Maximilian ; and likewise with the Lord Willoughby to Fredericke King of Denmarke. Sir William Dethick Knight, was crowned Garter in the eight and twen∣tieth yeare of Queene Elizabeth ; he was deposed the first yeare of King Iames. This Sir William Dethick lieth buried in Pauls, neare vnto Sir Payne Roet, vnder a large marble-stone. Whereupon this Inscription fol∣lowing is engrauen. Hic.....in Domino, Gulielmus Dethick Eques Auratus filius & heres Gilberti Dethick Equitis aurati. Qui ambo fuerunt Garterij Principales Re∣ges Armorum Anglicorum. Hic Anno 1584. aetat. 84. Ille anno 1612. etat. suae 70. in Domino obdormierunt. And after his deposing Sir William Segar Knight (now liuing, Ann. 1631.) was created Garter: he hath written a learned booke called Honour Militarie and Ciuill. A Succession of the Prouinciall Kings of Armes. Prouinciall Kings of Armes are, at this day, onely two, Clarentieux, and Norrey. Clarentieux was ordained by Edward the fourth: for he obtaining the Dukedome of Clarence by the death of George his brother, who was se∣cretly murdered in the Tower of London, made the Herauld which pro∣perly belonged to the Duke of Clarence, a King at Armes, and called him Clarentius, or Clarentieux : but in whose time, or vpon what occasion this name, and Office of Clarencieux began, I do not finde, saith Sir Henry Spel∣man, Glosslit H. but certainly it was of greater Antiquitie then from Ed∣ward the fourth, and might be called South-Roy, of his Prouince of South, as North-Roy or Norroy of the North parts. His proper Office is to Mar∣shall and dispose the Funeralls of all the lesser Nobilitie, as Knights and Esquires, thorow the Realme on the South side of Trent. The office of Norrey (the time nor the reason of his Creation and Title I do not know) is the same on the North side of Trent, that Clarentieux hath on this side, as may well appeare by his name, signifying the Nor∣therne King, or King of the North parts. These two (saith Milles ) haue by Charter power to visite the Noble∣mens Families, to set downe their Pedegrees, to distinguish their Armes, and in the open Market place to reproue such as falsely take vpon them Nobilitie or Gentrie. And to order euery mans Exequies and Funeralls, ac∣cording to their dignitie, and to appoint vnto them their Armes or En∣signes. The names, surnames, and seuerall adiuncts of these Kings of Armes, accor∣ding to the foresaid Catalogue beginning at Edward the first, and continued to these times. Iaques Hedingley in the time of King Ed. the first, was King of Armes by the name of Guyon. Sir Payne Rowet in the raigne of Edward the third, was King of Armes by the name of Guyon. Iohn March was King of Armes by the name of Norroy, 2. pars pat. An. 9. R. 2. Membr. 21. Richard del Brugge, otherwise called Lancaster, was King of Armes for the North in the time of Henry the fourth, and in the first of Henry the fifth. William Tyndall in the time of the foresaid Henry the fourth, was King of Armes by the name of Lancaster. ..... in the time of Henry the fifth, was King of Armes by the name of Agincourt.

He was also employed to attend vpon his Ma∣iesties Embassage which was sent in the yeare 1629. vnto the French king Lewis the thirteenth, and at the Ceremonies done thereat, he there perfor∣med his office in his Coat of Armes, as appeareth in a French relation late∣ly printed; at his returne from thence the King rewarded him with a Chaine of gold of good value, and a Medalle of his pourtraiture: And fur∣ther gaue him his Royall letters Mandatory, vnto all his Officers and Sub∣iects therein, signifying that (let me vse part of the Kings owne words) le Sieur Guillaum le Neue Escuyer Herault Darmes du Roy de la grand Bre∣tagne (nostre tr scher, et tresamè bon frere et beau frere) par luy envoyè vers nous pour faire sa dicte charge D'Herault D'armes aux Ceremonies du ser∣ment de la paix faicte entre nous & nostre dict frere, de la quelle il sest digne∣ment acquit a nostre contentement, seu retournant vers son Maistre.

Commanding by the said Instrument all his said Offi∣cers and Subiects to giue the said Herauld all manner of aide, and assistance in his returne, or not to molest or trouble him in his free passage or transpor∣tation of any of his goods. And therein also prayed, and required all Prin∣ces and States to do the like, as a due vnto Heraulds so imployed: And as they would haue him to doe the like at their request. But no earthly powers can command the mercilesse ragings of the Sea. For the said Herauld in his returne was ship-wracked vpon the coast of Douer, and very dangerously escaped with the losse of most part of his goods; excepting the foresaid Chaine and Medalle which after two dayes remaining in the sea was wash∣ed vp on shore, euen in view of the place where he then remained.

For Chester the Herauld, and Falco the Pursuiuant, liued at the command of the Prince of Wales, and serued him: Humfrey Duke of Glocester, and Earle of Penbroke, had the Herald Penbrooke, his domesticall Seruant. Richard also Duke of Glocester, hauing now obtained the kingdome, would needs haue his Herauld Glocester to be called King of Armes for all Wales. Charles Brandon Duke of Suffolke, retained Suffolke Herauld, and Marleon Pursuiuant. The Marquesse of Dor∣cester, kept Groby Herauld. The Earle of Northumberland, Northumber∣land Herauld, and Esperance Pursuiuant. Arthur Plantaginet Viscount Lisle, tooke vnto himselfe Lisle Pursuiuant, and Baron Hastings, Hasting Pursuiuant. But the condition of the Seruant is made better by the dignitie of his Lord and Master, so these forenamed Heraulds liued not with like authoritie or priuiledges with the Kings. And here now giue me leaue to speake a little more of the Aetymologie, Antiquitie, and dignitie of Heraulds in generall. Herald, The Aetymolo∣gie, Antiquity, and Dignity of Heralds. Herold, or Herault, dicitur quasi Herus altus, a high Maister: For this Officer was of great authoritie amongst the Romanes, who plural∣ly called them Feciales, a faciendo, quod belli pacisque faciendae penes cos ius erat, or Fediales a faedere faciendo. And so with vs the word signifieth an Officer at Armes, whose function is to denounce warre, to proclaime peace, or otherwise to be employed by the King, in martiall messages, or other businesse; and so they are called Internuncij vel pacis, vel belli ferendi. Mes∣sengers to carrie and offer either warre or peace. Heralt, saith Verstegan, in the Title of Honours and Offices, is meerely a Teutonic or Duytch word, and in that tongue and no other, the true Ae∣tymologie thereof is onely to be found. To begin then with the first syllable thereof, which is Here, though in composition abridged to Her, it is the true and ancient Teutonic word for an Armie, the same that Exercitus is in Latine; and in that sence it is yet vsed in Germany. And whereas the Germanes doe now vse Here also for Lord, yet anciently they so vsed it not. And although the Teutonic be more mixed with other strange languages; yet this word Here, as they vse it for Lord or master, hath crept into their language from Herus in Latine, after that the Latine tongue became knowne vnto them. A Healt in the Teutonick, is a most couragious person, a champion, or an especiall challenger to a fight or combat, of the weapon that such some∣time most vsed, called a Healtbard, because it was borne by a Healt, we yet, though corruptly, retaine the name of Holbard, and the Netherlands make it Heilbard. Here-healt by abbreuiation Heralt, as also Herald, doth rightly signifie, the Champion of the armie. And (growing to be a name of Office) he that hath in the armie the especiall charge to challenge vnto battell or combat: in which sense our name of Herald doth nearest approach vnto Fecialis in Latine, as I haue touched before. Heralds Priests Rosinus Ant. Rom. li. 3. c. 21. The Feciales amongst the Romanes, saith one, were Priests. For Numa Pompilius (who flourished circa ann. mundi 3283.) the second King of the Romanes, diuided the institution of diuine honour into eight parts, and so instituted and ordained eight seuerall orders of Priests; and endowed the Colledge of these Feciales or Heralds with the seuenth part of this his sa∣cred constitution. Their Colledge at Rome was composed of twenty He∣raulds, chosen out of ancient and eminent families, the chiefe whereof (for excellence) was called Pater Patratus, because by being chiefe of that com∣panie, he ought to haue children, and his owne Father yet liuing. Their chiefe office was, To take care that the Romanes did not commence, and make vniust warre against any confederate Citie, and that if any such a city had committed any thing against the conditions of the confederacie, truce, and entercourse, then they were to go as Embassadours, first to challenge their right in milde words; which if denyed, then to proclaime warre, Ne∣que iustum aliquod bellum fore censebatur, nisi id per Feciales esset indictum : Neither was any warre thought to be iust and lawfull, but that which was denounced by these Feciales, or Heralds. Heralds of France of no∣ble descent. In France (saith Andrew Favine ) Heralds haue euer beene in high esteeme, and not onely the King of Armes, Mont-ioy, S. Denis, but also the other Heralds, and Pursuiuants, were of noble extraction: and Mont-ioy could not be admitted without making proofe of his Noblenesse by three races, as well of his Fathers stocke, as by his mothers side. There was two thousand pounds of rents in Lands and free tenure, allowed for the said Mont-ioy particularly, and a thousand pounds of annuall pension, besides other rights. As for the other Heralds, they haue a thousand pounds in pen∣sion, with other rights and priuiledges. Now for such rights and priuiledges as were granted to kings of Armes and Heralds, some doe ascribe them to the King and Emperour Charle∣maigne : others to Alexander the Great of Macedon, and others to the Emperour of Germany, Charles king of Bohemia, fourth of that name, nou∣rished from his youth in the Court of the Father of Cheualrie, Philip de Valoys, king of France, sixth and last of that name, as here followeth the tenure in these words. The Priuiledges granted to Kings, and Heralds of Armes, translated out of the French in the Theater of Honour. My Souldiers, you are and shall bee called Heralds, Companions for kings, and Iudges of crimes committed by Noblemen; and arbitratours of their quarrels and differences. You must liue hereafter exempted from go∣ing any more to warre, or militarie factions. Councell kings for the best, the benefit of the weale publique, and for their Honour and Royall dignitie. Correct all matters vile and dishonest: fauour widowes, succour orphanes, and defend them from all violence. Assist with your counsell such Princes and Lords in whose Courts you shall abide, and freely and without feare, demand of them whatsoeuer is needfull for you, as food, rayment, and de∣frayings. If any one of them shall deny you, let him bee infamous, without glory or honour, and reputed as criminall of high treason. In like manner also, haue you an especiall care, to keepe your selues from vilifying your no∣ble exercise, and the Honour wherewith you ought to come neare vs at all times. See there be no entrance into Princes Courts, either of drunkennesse, ill speaking, flattery, babling indiscreetly, ianglery, buffonnerie, and such other vices, which soyle and shame the reputation of men. Giue good ex∣ample euery where, maintaine equitie, and repaire the wrongs done by great men to their inferiours. Remember what priuiledges we haue granted you, in recompence of the painfull trauells in warre, which you endured with vs. And let not the Honours which we haue bestowed on you, bee conuerted to blame and infamie by dishonest liuing: the punishment where∣of we reserue to our selfe, and to the Kings of France our Successours. Seuen Danish Kings, besides some of Norway, and Sweden, haue had for their proper appellation the name of Herald, or Harold, which is all one with Heralt, saith Verstegan. So honourable was it accounted of in old time, that so many Kings thereby were called, in regard as it appeareth, that themselues might be honoured and respected as the most couragious of the armie. Heralds (saith Stow ) (out of an old History, Stow in the life of Brute. written aboue sixe hundred yeares since, which he found in the Reuestrie or Treasurie of Saint Pauls Church) be they which our Elders were wont to call Heroes, that is to say, those which were greater, or surpassing all men in Maiestie, and yet inferi∣our to the Gods. For, whom the people of antiquitie did perceiue to be no∣table, and surmounting all others in his acts and feates, renowned in ver∣tues, and friendly or gracious vnto them; him would they magnifie, and exalt in the highest degree, and as it were, with their good words make him cosin to Iove the omnipotent. Placing such amongst the Gods, if it so were, that they had wrought some miraculous feate aboue the common course of Nature. But if there were no such miraculous or wonderfull deeds, but that through their vertues they seemed wonderfull and honou∣rable, then thought they to call such persons, not altogether Gods, nor yet simplie men, but inuented out a meane word and name for them, calling them Heroes, as it were halfe-gods, and of this word Heroes, or Heros, grow∣eth by corruption of vse this name Herald. In the same place he proues that Heralds here in England were as an∣cient as the dayes of Brute (who flourished aboue eleuen hundred yeares before the birth of Christ) who bare (saith hee) Gules, two Lions ram∣pant, endorsed Or, according to this peece out of Hardings Chronicle. The Armes of Brute. He bare of Goulis twoo liones of golde Countre Rampant, with golde only crouned, Which kings of Troy in bataill barefull bold. Neither can it be iustly said, for all this, that Heralds were not knowne nor in request in this kingdome, but since the time of Brute. For euen from the instant, that the descendants of Adam were distinguished into Nobles and Yeomen; there haue beene combats, battells, and encounters, and con∣sequently Heralds, deriued from the body of Nobilitie. Now at the length let me turne backe to the foresaid defunct Sir Iohn Wriothesley, to whom, and to the rest of the Kings Heralds and Pursui∣uants of Armes; king Richard the third in the first yeare of his raigne, granted and gaue by his letters Patents, Cold Harber the Heralds Colledge. all that messuage with the appurte∣nances called Cold-Harber, in the Parish of All Saints the little in London; freeing them à Subsidijs, theolonijs, & omnibus Reipub. muneribus : Dated at Westminster the second of March, without fine or fee. How the said He∣ralds departed therewith (saith Stow ) I haue not read: but in the raigne of Henry the eight, the Bishop of Durhams house, neare Charing Crosse, be∣ing taken into the Kings hand; Cuthbert Tunstall, Bishop of Durham, was lodged in this Cold-Harber. But in my iudgement I still digresse, or at leastwise driue off my Reader ouer long from the knowledge of the time of this mans death; which I can∣not set downe neither certainly: yet I gather by circumstances, that it should be about the latter end of the raigne of king Hen. the seuenth. Eleanor Lady Wriothesley. Here lyeth buried by her husband, Eleanor, the second wife of the fore∣said Sir Iohn Wriothesley. Ioan Wriothesley.

In this Parish and partly (as I take it) in Saint Peters the little, is a faire house, sometime (belonging to the Stanleys ; vpon the outward wall where∣of are embossed the Armes, or rather, if you will, the legges of the Isle of Man; for that the Stanleys, honoured with the title of Earles of Darby, were commonly called Kings of Man. This house was built by Thomas Stanley, first of that sirname, Earle of Darby, and so for a long time it was called Darbie House, but at length it being in the tenure of Sir Richard Sackuile knight, fallen by morgage vnto him, for which morgage, Thomas Howard Duke of Norfolke, out of his affection to the office of Armes, sa∣tisfied the said Sir Richard ; who thereupon past it ouer to Q. Mary, and at the instant request of the said Duke, she by her Charter granted it to Sir Gilbert Dethicke, as then Garter, principall King of Armes, who lieth buri∣ed in this Church; Thomas Hauley, Clarencieux, king of Armes of the south parts, William Haruey, Norroy, king of Armes of the north parts; and to the other Heralds and Pursuiuants of Armes (expressing their titles and order) qui pro tempore fuerint, The Heralds Office. in perpetuum; vt essent vnum corpus cor∣poratum in re, facto, & nomine: habeantque successionem perpetuam, nec non quoddam sigillum commune.

Here lieth interred the body of Iohn Leland, or Leyland, Natiue of this honourable Citie of London, Iohn Leland the Antiquary brought vp in the Vniuersities of England and France, where he greatly profited in all good learning and languages: Keeper of the Libraries he was to King Henry the Eight, in which Office he chiefly applied himselfe to the study of Antiquities; wherein he was so laborious and exquisite, that few, or none, either before or since, may bee with him compared: which will best appeare by his New yeares gift to the said King Henry, written in Latine, and translated into English by his con∣temporarie companion, Iohn Bale, and by him intituled.

The study of Antiquity in Hen. the eight. Vbi tuae celsit udini visum fuit, &c. so it begins in Latine. Where as it pleased youre hyghnesse vpon very iust consideratyons to encourage mee, by the authoryte of youre moste graciouse Commyssion, to peruse and dy∣ligently to serche all the Libraries of Monasteries and Collegies of this youre noble Realme, to the entent that the Monuments of auncyent Wry∣ters, as well of other Nacyons, as of your owne Prouynce, myghte be brought out of deadly darkenesse, to lyuely lyght, and to receiue lyke thankes of their posteryte, as they hoped for at such time, as they employ∣ed their long and great studies to the publique wealthe. The ca e King Hen had of Re∣ligion. Yea, and furthermore, that the holy scripture of God might both be sin∣cerely taught and learned, all maner of supersticion and crafty coloured do∣ctrine of a rowte of romane Bishops totally expelled oute of this your most Catholique realme. I thinke it now no lesse, than my very dewtie, breuely to declare to your Maiestie, what frutes haue spronge of my laboriouse iourney and costly enterprise, both roted vpon your infinite goodnesse and liberalite, qualitees, right highly to be estemed in al Princes, and most spe∣cially in yow, as naturally your owne wele knowne proprietes. The workes of ancient Wri∣ters saued and conserued. First I haue conserued many good authors, the which otherwise had ben like to haue perished, to no small incommodite of good letters. Of the which, parte remaine in the most magnificent libraries of your royall Pala∣ces. Part also remaine in my custodie, whereby I trust right shortly, so to describe your most noble Realme, and to publish the Maiestie of the excel∣lent actes of youre progenitors, The Kings Li¦braries aug∣mented. hitherto sore obscured, bothe for lacke of emprinting of such workes as lay secretly in corners. And also because men of eloquence hath not enterprised to set them forth in a florishing stile, in some times past not commonly vsed in England of Writers, The plaine le and forme of uncient Writers. otherwise wele learned, and now in such estimacion, that ex∣cept truth be delicately clothed in purpure, her written veritees can scant finde a Reader. That all the world shall euidently perceiue, that no parti∣cular region, may iustly be more extolled, than yours for true nobilitie and vertues at all points renoumed. Farther, more part of the exemplaries, curiously sought by me, and for∣tunately found in sundry places of this your dominion, hath bene emprin∣ted in Germany, and now be in the presses chefely of Frobenus, that not alonly the Germaines, but also the Italianes themselfe, that count as the Grekes ded full arrogantly, all other Nacions to be barbarouse and vnlet∣tered, sauing their owne, shall haue a direct occasion openly of force to say: That Britannia prima fuit parens, Britaine, the Mother of worthy men, and excellent wits. altrix (addo hoc etiam & iure quidem optimo) conseruatrix cùm virorum magnorum tum maxime ingeniorum: Britaine was a mother, a nurse, and a maintainer, not onely of worthy men, but also of most excellent wits. And that profite hath risen by the aforesaid iourney, in bringing full many things to light, as concerning the vsurped autorite of the Bishop of Rome and his complices, to the manifest and violent derogation of Kingly dignite: I referre my selfe most humbly to your most prudent, learned, and high iudgement, This volume he called Antiphi∣lachia, written against the ambitious Em∣pire, or vsur∣ped authoritie Reiall of the Bishop of Rome. Albertus Pighi∣us, a Canon sometime in the Cathedrall Church of Vtrecht in the Low Coun∣tries. to discerne my diligence in the long Volume, wherein I haue made answer for the defence of your supreme dignitie, al only lening to the strong pillor of holy scripture, against the whole Colledge of the Ro∣manists, cloking their crafty affections and arguments, vnder the name of one poore Pighius of Vltraiect in Germany, and standing to them as to their onely anker, hold against tempests that they know will arise, if truth may be by licens lette in to haue a voyce in the generall counsell. Yet herin only I haue not pytched the supreme worke of my labour, wherunto your grace, most like a kinglye Patron of all good lernyng, ded animate me. But also considering and expending with my selfe, how great a number of excellent godly wittes and writers, lerned with the best, as the times serued, hath bene in this your region; Not onely at such times as the Romane Emperors had recourse to it, but also in those daies that the Sax∣ons preuailed of the Britaines, Lelands affecti∣on toward his Country. and the Normans of the Saxons, could not but with a feruent zele, and honest corage, commend them to memory Els, alas, like to haue bene perpetually obscured, or to haue lightly remem∣bred as vncertaine shaddowes. Wherfor I knowing by infinite varietie of bookes, and assiduouse rea∣ding of them, Four Bookes of illustrious men, or of the British writers. who hath bene lerned, and who hath written from time to time in this realme, haue digested into four bokes, the names of them, with their liues and monuments of lerning. And to them added this title. De vi∣ris illustribus, folowing the profitable example of Hierome, Gannadie, Cas∣siodore, Seuerayne, and Trittemie, a late Writer. But alway so handling the matter, that I haue more exspaciated in this campe, then they ded, as in a thing that desired to be somewhat at large, and to haue ornature. The first boke beginning at the Druides, is deducted vnto the time of the comming of S. Augustine into England. The second is from the time of Augustine, vnto the aduente of the Normans. The third from the Normans, to the end of the moste honourable reigne of the mightie, famouse, and prudent Prince, Henry the seuenth your Father. The fourth beginneth with the name of your Maieste, whose glory in lerning, is to the world so clerely knowne, that though emonge the liues of other lerned men, I haue accu∣rately celebrated the names of Bladud, Learned Prin∣ces. Mulmutius, Constantinus Magnus, Sigebert, Alfridus, Alfridus magnus, Athelsta e, and Henry the first, Kings, and your progenitors. And also Ethelward, second sonne to Alfride the great, Humfryde, Duke of Glocester, and Tipetote Earle of Worcestre, yet conferred with your grace, they serue as small lights (if I may freely say my iudgement, your high modesty not offended) in respect of the daye starre. The wits of the British and English writers exercised in all kinds of good literature. Now farther to insinuate to your grace, of what matters the Writers, whose liues I haue congested into foure bookes, hath treated of. I may right boldly say; that beside the cognicion of the foure tongues, in the which, par of them hath excelled, that there is no kinde of liberall science, or any feate concerning learning, in the which they haue not shewed cer∣taine arguments o great felicitie of witte. Yea, and concerning the interpre∣tation of holy Scripture, both after the ancient forme, and sens the schola∣sticall trade, they haue reigned as in a certaine excellency. A wonderfull great number of Historio∣graphers of British affaires. And as touching historicall knowledge, there hath bene to the number of a full hundreth or mo, that from time to time hath with great diligence, and no lesse faith, wolde to God with like eloquence, perscribed the actes of your noble predecessors, and the fortunes of this your Realme, so in∣credibly great, that hee that hath not seane, and throughly redde their workes, can litle pronounce in this parte. Wherfor, after that I had perpended the honest and profitable studies of these Historiographers, I was totally enflamed with a loue, to see throughly all those partes of this your opulent and ample realme, Lelands labori∣ous iourney throughout all England. that I had redde of in the aforsaid Writers. In so much that, all my other occupa∣cions intermitted, I haue so traueled in your dominions, both by the see coastes and the middle parts, sparing neither labour nor costs, by the space of these sixe yeeres past, that there is almost neither cape nor baye, hauen, creke, or pere, riuer, or confluence of riuers, breches, washes, lakes, meres, fenny waters, mountaines, vallies, mores, hethes, forestes, woodes, cities, burges, castels, principall manor places, monasteries, and colleges; but I haue seane them, and noted in so doing a whole world of things very me∣morable. Thus instructed, I trust shortly to see the time, that like as Carolus Mag∣nus had among his treasures, three large notable tables of siluer, richly en∣ameled; one of the site and description of Constantinople, The descripti∣on of all En∣gland in a qua∣drate table of siluer. another of the site and figure of the magnificente Citee of Rome, and the third of descryp∣cyon of the world. So shall your Maiestie haue this your world and impery of Englande, so set forth in a quadrate table of siluer, if God send me life to accomplish my beginning, that your Grace shall haue ready knowledge at the first sight of many right delectable, fruitfull, and necessary pleasures, by contemplacion thereof, as often as occasion shall moue you to the sight of it. And because that it may be more permanent, and farther knowne, then to haue it engraued in siluer or brasse; A Booke of the Topogra∣phie of Eng∣land. I entend by the leaue of God, within the space of twelue moneths following, such a description to make of your realme in writing, that it shall be no mastery after, for the Grauer or Pain∣ter to make the like by a perfect example. Yea, and to wade farther in this matter, where as now almost no man can wele gesse at the shadow of the ancient names of hauens, riuers, promon∣tories, hilles, The names of seuerall nati∣ons, Cities, and great townes, &c. of Britaine in old time, such as Cesar, Tacitus, Ptoli∣mey, & other Authors haue made mention of, restored to∣gether with the later and moderne names. woods, Cities, Townes, Castles, and varyete of kyndes of people, that Cesar, Liui, Strabo, Diodorus, Fabius, Pictor, Pomponius Me∣la, Plinius, Cornelius Tacitus, Ptolomeus, Sextus Rufus, Ammianus Mar∣cellinus, Solinus, Antoninus, and diuerse other make mencyon of. I trust so to open this wyndow, that the lyght shall be seene, so long, that is to say, by the space of a whole thousand yeeres stopped vp, and the old glory of your renowned Britayne to reflorish through the worlde. This done, I haue matter of plenty, already prepared for this purpose, that is to say, to write an History, to the which I entend to ascribe this ti∣tle, De Antiquitate Britannica, or else Civilis Historia. And this worke I en∣tend to diuide into so many bookes, as there be Shyres in England, and shires and great dominions in Wales. So that I esteeme that this Volume will enclude a fifty bookes, Of the Anti∣quitie of Bri∣taine, or of Ciuile History fiftie Bookes. whereof each one seuerally shall containe the beginnings, encreases, and memorable acts of the chiefe Townes and Ca∣stles of the Prouince allotted to it. Then I entend to distribute into sixe bookes, such matter as I haue al∣ready collected, Sixe Bookes of the Islands ad∣iacent to Eng∣land. concerning the Isles adiacent to your noble realme, and vn∣dre your subieccyon. Wherof three shall be of these Isles, Vecta, Mona, and Menavia, somtime kyngedomes. And to superadde a worke as an ornament and a right comely garlande to the enterprises aforesaid, I haue selected stuffe to be distributed into three bookes, Three bookes of the Nobility of Britaine. the which I purpose thus to entitle, De Nobilitate Britannica. Wherof the first shall declare the names of Kynges and Quenes, with their children, Dukes, Earles, Lordes, Capitaynes and rulers in this realme to the commynge of the Saxons and theyr Conquest. The seconde shall be of the Saxons. The thirde from the Normans to the reygne of your most no∣ble grace, descending lineally of the Brytayne, Saxon, and Norman kynges. So that all noble men shall clerely perceyve their lyneall parentele. Now, His conclusion a delectabili & vtili. if it shall be the pleasure of Almighty God, that I may lyve to per∣forme these things that be already begonne, and in a great forwardnesse, I trust that this your realme shall so wele be knowne, ones paynted wyth his native colours, that the renowne thereof shall geue place to the glory of no other region. And my great labours and costes, procedynge from the most habundant fountayne of your infinite goodnesse towards me your pore scholar and most humble servaunt, shall be euydently seane to have not on∣ly pleased, but also profyted the studyouse, gentill, and equall reders. This is the briefe declaracyon of my laboriouse iourney, taken by mocyon of your hyghnesse, so much studying at all houres, aboute the frutefull prefer∣ment of good letters, and auncyent vertues. Christ contynue your most royall estate and the prosperyte, Commune vo wyth suc∣cessyon in kyngely dignite, of your deere and worthylye beloued sonne Prynce Edward, grauntynge you a numbre of Pryncely sonnes, by the most gracyouse, benygne, and modest Lady your Quene Cataryne. Iohannes Leylandus Antiquarius. Iohn Bale, in his declaration vpon this Treatise, saith that the next yeare after that Leyland presented this New-yeares Gift to king Henry, the said king deceased, and Leyland by a most pitifull accident fell besides his wits; which was the cause (belike) that these his workes were neuer imprinted; howsoeuer at this day, the written copies thereof are in some priuate mens custody; which learned Camden saw, as he himselfe acknowledgeth, when hee compiled that matchlesse Chorographicall description of Great Bri∣taine. But those learned Authors which Leyland gathered together in his iour∣ney, and which hee conserued to augment the Kings Libraries and his owne; are, I doubt, by the iniquitie of times, quite lost and perished. And here I might take occasion to speake of the great spoile of old Bookes, and all other reuerend Antiquities at and vpon the suppression of Abbeyes, and reformation of Religion. As also of the due praise belonging to such men in these dayes, who like Sir Robert Cotton with labour and charges, Sir Rob. Cotton knight and Baronet. collect, and safely preserue these ancient Monuments of learning for the publique good and commodity of the whole kingdome. But of this when I come to that inestimable rich Treasurie, Sir Tho. Bodley knights. that famous and renowned Library in the Vniuersitie of Oxford, whose principall Founder was Sir Thomas Bodley knight, deceased. To returne then to our Antiquarie Leyland ; Many other workes, (saith Bale, in the foresaid declaration) hath Leyland written, of whom some are emprinted, as the Assertion of king Arthure, the Birth of Prince Edward, the Song of the Swanne, the decease of Sir Thomas Wiet, the winning of Bullein, and the commendation of Peace. Some are not yet printed, as his Colleccyons of the Byshoppes of Brytayne, of the Vniuersytees of the same, of the orygynoll and increase of good learnynges there: Of his Epi∣grammes and Epitaphs, and the lyfe of kynge Sygebert, with many other more. He died franticke the 18. day of Aprill, Anno redemptionis humanae, 1552. Of whom this Ogdoasticke following was composed, either by himselfe, as the stile sheweth, or by some other in his name, saith Pitseus. Pit. Aetas 16. Quantum Rhenano debet Germania docto, Tantum debebit terra Britanna mihi. Ille suae gentis ritus, & nomina prisca, Aestiuo fecit lucidiora die. Ipse antiquarum rerum quoque magnus amator, Ornabo patriae lumina clara meae. Quae cum prodierint niueis inscripta tabellis, Tum testes nostrae sedulitatis erunt: These verses were annexed to his Monument, as I haue it by tradi∣tion. Io. Leland the Elder. This our Leland is called by writers Lelandus iunior, in regard of ano∣ther Iohn Leland, who flourished in the time of king Henry the sixth; taught a Schoole in Oxford, and writ certaine Treatises of the Art of Grammer. Which Leland, saith Pits, was tum in versu, tum in prosa multo elegantior, & in omni Latinitate purior, tersior, nitidior, quam ferebat illius at at is com∣munis consuetudo : As well in verse as prose, much more elegant, and in all the Latine tongue more pure, polisht, and neate, then the custome of that age did commonly affoard. Whereupon this riming Hexameter was made to his commendation. Vt Rosa slos slorum, sic Leland Grammaticorum.

Clarke of the Pipe (saith the Interpreter) is an Officer in the Kings Ex∣chequer, who hauing all accounts and debts due vnto the king, deliuered, and drawne downe out of the Remembrancers Offices, chargeth them downe into the great Roll. Who also writeth summons vnto the Shiriffe to leuie the said debts, vpon the goods and chattels of the said debtors: and if they haue no goods, then doth he draw them downe to the Lord Trea∣surers Remembrancer, to write Extreats against their Land. The ancient Reuenew of the Crowne remayneth in charge before him, and he seeth the same answered by the Fermers and Shiriffes to the king. He maketh a charge to all Shiriffes of their summons of the Pipe and Greenewax, and seeth it answered vpon their accounts.

Many Monuments of the Dead in Churches in and about this Citie of London, as also in some places of the countrey, are couered with seates or pewes, made high and easie for the Parishioners to sit or sleepe in, a fashion of no long continuance, and worthy of reformation. Of the Diocesse of London, the Battels therein fought, and of the Burialls of the Dead slaine in those terrible conflicts. NOw as I haue before spoken somewhat of the Bishoprickes of Cant. and Rochester, so let me here speake a little of this Diocesse of Lon∣don, which extendeth so farre in circuit, as the Site of the East or Middle Saxons kingdome anciently comprised; which was bounded on the East with the Ocean; on the South with the Thames, on the West with the Colne, and on the North with the Riuer Stowre; within the limits where∣of, Midlesex, Essex, and a part of Hertfordshire are contained. The glory of which Diocesse is principally Midlesex, in regard of the far-famed City of London, the Metropolis of England (of which I haue spoken before) and the chiefe seat of her sacred Bishops: as also in regard of the Riuer of Thames, the king of all our Riuers. Of whom, and of the rare prospects he views in his passage betweene Windsore and London Bridge, a late Poet thus versifies. M. Drayton, Pol. 17. Song. But now this mighty Flood, vpon his voiage prest (That found how with his strength, his beauties still increast, From where, braue Windsore stood on tiptoe to behold The faire and goodly Thames, so farre as ere he could, With kingly houses crownd, of more then earthly pride, Vpon his either Bankes as he along doth glide) With wonderfull delight, doth his long course pursue, Where Otlands, Hampton Court, and Richmond he doth view. Then Westminster the next great Tames doth entertaine, That vaunts her Pallace large, and her most sumptuous Fane: The Lands tribunall seate that challengeth for hers, The crowning of our kings, their famous Sepulchres. Then goes he on along by that more beautious Strand, Expressing both the wealth and brauery of the Land. (So many sumptuous Bowres, within so little space The All-beholding Sunne scarse sees in all his race) And on by London leads, which like a Crescent lies, London lying like a halfe moone. Whose windowes seeme to mocke the Star-befreckled skies. Besides her rising Spyres, so thicke themselues that show, As doe the bristling reedes, within her bankes that grow. There sees his crouded Wharfes, and people-pestred shores, London Bridge the Crowne of Tames. His bosome ouerspread with shoales of labouring ores: With that most costly Bridge, that doth him most renowne, By which he cleerely puts all other Riuers downe. Camd. in Mid. Midlesex (saith Camden ) is for aire passing temperate, and for soile fer∣tile, with sumptuous houses, and prety Townes on all sides pleasantly beau∣tified: and euery where offereth to the view many things memorable: Whereupon a Germane Poet thus versified. Tot campos, syluas, tot regia tecta, tot hortos Artifici dextrâ excultos, tot vidimus arces, Vt nunc Ansonio Tamisis cum Tibride certet. So many fields, and pleasant woods, so many Princely Bowres, And Pallaces we saw besides, so many stately towres, So many Gardens trimly drest by curious hand which are, That now with Romane Tiberis, the Tames may well compare. This County is comprised within short bounds, being in length, where it is the longest, not passing twenty miles, and in the narrowest place not passing twelue miles. The length thereof (saith Speed ) extended from Stratford in the East, Speed of Mi . to Morehall vpon Colne in the West, is by measure nineteene English miles; and from South Mims in the North to his Maiesties Mannour of Hamp∣ton Court in the South, are little aboue sixteene miles: the whole circum∣ference extending to ninety. In forme it is almost square, for aire passing temperate, for soile abun∣dantly fertile; and for pasturage and graine of all kindes, yeelding the best, so that the wheat of this County hath serued a long time for the Manchet to our Princes table. It lieth seated in a vale, most wholsome and rich, hauing some hills also, and them of good ascent; from whose tops the prospect of the whole is seene like vnto Zoar in Egypt, Gen 14.10. or rather like a Paradise and Garden of God. Fiue Princely houses inheritable to the English Crowne, are seated in this Shire, which are, Enfield, Hanworth, Whitehall, S Iames, and Ham∣pton Court, Hampton Court. a City rather in shew, then the Pallace of a Prince: and for stately port and gorgeous building not inferiour to any in Europe. A worke of admirable magnificence (saith Camden ) built out of the ground by Thomas Wolsey Cardinall, Camd in Mid. in ostentation of his riches, when for very pride, being otherwise a most prudent man, he was not able to manage his minde. But it was made an Honor, enlarged and finished by king Hen∣ry the eight so amply, as it containeth within it fiue seuerall inner Courts, passing large, enuironed with very faire buildings wrought right curiously, and goodly to behold. Of which Leyland writeth thus. Est locus insolito rerum splendore superbus, Alluiturque vaga Tamisini fluminis vnda, Nomine ab antiquo iam tempore dictus Avona. Hic Rex Henricus taleis Octauius aedes Erexit, qualeis toto Sol aureus orbe Non vidit. A stately place for rare and glorious shew, There is which Tames with wandring streame doth dowsse; Times past, by name of Avon men it knew: Heere Henry th'Eight of that name built an house So sumptuous, as that on such an one (Seeke through the world) the bright Sunne neuer shone. And another in the Nuptiall Poeme of Tame and Isis. Alluit Hamptonum celebrem quae laxior vrbis Mentitur formam spacijs, hanc condidit Aulam Purpureus pater ille grauis, grauis ille Sacerdos Wolsaeus, fortuna sauos cui felle repletos Obtulit heu tandem fortunae dona dolores. He runs by Hampton, which, for spatious seat Seemes Citie-like: Of this faire courtly Hall First founder was a Priest and Prelate great Wolsey, that graue and glorious Cardinall. Fortune on him had pour'd her gifts full fast, But Fortunes Blisse, Alas, prou'd Bale at last. C sar. Comm nt. lib. 5. The ancient Inhabitants of Middlesex, as also of Essex, were called by Caesar, the Trinobantes, whom hee nameth to be the most puissant in the Land, with whom he and his armie had many bloudie bickerings nere and vpon the bankes of the riuer of Tames, Burials neere Stanes. wherein many were slaine on ei∣ther side, which lie interred in the fields twixt Shepperton and Stanes. Spec. Brit. Some affirme Stanes (saith Norden ) to be so called of the Stakes, called Goway Stakes, which were fixed in the Thames by the Britons, to preuent Iulius Caesar of passing his armie through the riuer. Lib. 1. cap. 2. Of which, and of the conflicts and skirmishes betwixt the Britaines and Romanes, thus venera∣ble Bede writes. Caesars Horsemen at the first encounter, were ouerthrowne of the Bri∣taines, and Labienus one of his Colonels slaine. At the second encounter, with great losse of his Army, he put the Britaines to flight. From thence he went vnto the riuer of Tames, which men say cannot bee waded ouer, but in one place: where on the farther side, a great number of the Britaines warded the bankes, vnder Cassibelan their Captaine, who had stucke the bottome of the riuer, and the bankes also thicke of great stakes, whereof certaine remnants vnto this day are to be seene, of Piles, of the bignesse of a mans thigh, couered with lead, sticking fast in the bottome of the riuer; which when the Romanes had espied, and escaped, the Britaines, not able to withstand the violence of the Roman Legions, hid themselues in the woods, out of the which they often breaking forth, greatly endamaged the Army of the Romanes. Burials neere Brainford. In and about Brainford or Brentford, the bodies of many a warlike Commander and expert Souldier lie inhumed, which were slaine in that fierce and terrible battaile, betwixt Edmund Ironside, and the Danes, which he had driuen from the siege of London; at a place now called Turn∣ham Greene, thereunto adioyning; in which battaile he gaue the Danes a bloudy ouerthrow, losing few of his armie, saue such as were drowned in the riner of Tames as they passed ouer. In the yeare, 7141. and the day being the Paschall, whereon Christ rose from death, (which with due reuerence is celebrated in all the Christian world) vpon Gladmore heath, halfe a mile from Barnet, was foughten a most fierce and cruell Battaile, betwixt King Edward the fourth, and Ri∣chard Neuill the great Earle of Warwicke, (the Mars and Make-King of England) contending to reestablish that holy, and yet vnfortunate, King Henry the sixt in his regall authoritie. In this battaile vpon King Edwards part were slaine, Burials of the dead slaine at Barnet field. Humfrey Bourchier Lord Cromwell, Henry Bourchier, sonne and heire to the Lord Barners, both buried at Westminster. In the quarrell of King Henry, were slaine the foresaid Richard Neuill Earle of Warwicke, and Iohn Neuill, Marquesse Montacute his brother, both buried at Bisham Abbey in Barkeshire; the bo∣dies of many others of the Nobilitie and Gentrie, on both parties which perished in this vnnaturall conflict, had Christian buriall in the Frier Au∣gustines Church London. The common Souldiers, as also many Comman∣ders, were buried vpon the same Plaine where the foresaid battaile was strucken: to whose memory a Chappell was built vpon the said Plaine, and a Priest appointed to say Masse for their soules, as the doctrine went in those daies. Vpon both sides of common Souldiers, there died that holy Easter day, as then the 14. of Aprill, saith Ed. Hall, ten thousand: foure thousand, saith Io. Stow, and Rob. Fabian saith, (farre lesse) fifteene hundred, so vncer∣taine, as I haue said before, is the number of the dead slaine in battaile. Howsoeuer a part onely of Hertfordshire is comprised within this Dio∣cesse, yet giue me leaue to say somewhat in this place, Camd. in Hert. of the whole Coun∣ty: A rich Countrie (saith Clarencieux ) in corne Fields, Pastures, Me∣dowes, Woods, Groues, and cleere riuerets. And for ancient townes it may contend with the neighbours, euen for the best. For, there is scarcely another in all England that can shew more good townes in so small a com∣passe; the whole circumference of the Shire being but about an hundred and thirtie miles. In this County, and in the towne of S. Albans, two mortall and bloudy battels of Englands ciuill dissentions, The first battel of S. Albans. haue beene fought. The first where∣of chanced the 24. of May, Anno 1455. by Richard, Duke of Yorke, with his associates, the Earles of Warwicke and Salisbury, and Lords of Faw∣conbridge, and Cobham, against King Henry the sixt. In whose defence, Edmund, Duke of Somerset, Henry, Earle of Northumberland, and Iohn, Lord Clifford, with fiue thousand more, lost their liues, the King himselfe was wounded in the necke with an arrow, the Duke of Buckingham, and Lord Sudley, in their faces; Humfrey Earle Stafford in his right hand, and the Earle Dorset almost slaine. On the Dukes part, onely sixe hundred were slaine. Of which battell, and of the timerous flight of the Souldiers on the Kings partie, the learned Abbot of Saint Albans, Iohn Wheathamstead, who liued in those daies, writes thus. Marcia splendiferum regerent cum sydera celum, Mss In bib. Co Aspicerentque feros toruis aspectibus Angl s, Albani Villam tranquilla pace vigentem Fedarunt multo violenter sanguine fuso. Rex aderat presens secumque cohors satis ingent De Dominis Regni: contrarius hijs Eboraci Dux que duo comites Warwici et Sarsburiensis Venerunt, media fit grandis pugna platea. In qua corruerant qui nobilitate vigebant De patria Boree comes insignis Dominusque. Corruit ac ipse qui belli causa fuisse Fertur, Dux magnus de Somercethe vocitatus: Ac alij plures, satis asperasors fuit ipsis. Multi fugerunt, aliter se non properarunt Quin faciunt trepide visum fugiendo Columbe. Insultum ve Canis, Damus, Lepus ac fera queuis Dum fugiunt nemora pecierunt siue Frutecta; In quibus vt pueri virgam metuendo magistri Se pudet id ferre vecorditer occoluere. Qui fuerant nostra proprius penetralia tecta Ad nos fugerunt sub Stallis et latuerunt, Aut infra latebras; timor ingens duxerat ipsos. Sic imbecillis tergum dedit hostibus hostis; Non sine dedecore, nec nominis absque rubore. Mors est non vita sub turpi viuere fama.

The second battell fought in this towne of Saint Albans, was by Queene Margaret, against the Dukes of Norfolke and Suffolke, the Earles of Warwicke and Arundell, that by force kept with them, the King her hus∣band, with whom by constraint he held, and on their side fought vntill the field was lost, and Lords fled, when with great ioy he was receiued by his Queene, and yong sonne Prince Edward. This battell sell the 17. of February▪ being Shrouesunday. Of this towne, and of these two battels, thus Camden writes in a more succinct and serious stile. Camd. in Hert. As Antiquity consecrated this place (saith he) to be an Altar of Religi∣on: so Mars also may seeme to haue destined it for the very plot of bloudy battaile For, to let other particulars goe by, when England vnder the two houses of Lancaster and Yorke, bereft, as it were, of vitall breath, was rea∣dy through a ciuill warre to sinke downe and fall in a swoune: the chiefe Captaines on both sides ioyned battaile twise with reciprocall varietie of fortune in the very towne. First, Richard Duke of Yorke gaue the Lan∣castrians here a sore ouerthrow, tooke King Henry the sixt captiue, and slew many honourable personages. Foure yeares after, the Lancastrians vn∣der the conduct of Queene Margaret, wonne here the field, put the house of Yorke to flight, and restored the King to his former liberty. The bodies of such of the Nobility, Burials of the dead slaine in the battels at S. Albans. and others of eminent ranke and qualitie which lost their liues in these mortall contentions, were buried in the Abbey Church, (as I haue partly touched before) in Saint Peters, and in other religious Structures, accordingly as they were befriended; the common Souldiers were buried in Church-yards, and vpon a little greene at the Townes end, called No mans land, which lies betwixt the two waies (as I take it) leading to Luton, and Sandridge. Nere vnto the roade high way (saith Camden in this tract) betweene Stenenhaugh and Knebworth (the seat of the worshipfull house of the Lit∣tons, Burials of the dead betwixt Stenenhaugh, and Kneb∣worth. descended from Litton in Darbishire) I saw certaine round hils cast vp by mans hands, such as the old Romans were wont to reare for Souldi ers slaine in the wars, of which the Captaine himselfe laid the first turse: and now for Essex. Essex is a country large in compasse, Camd. in Essex. (the circumference thereof being one hundred forty sixe miles) fruitfull of woods, plentifull of Saffron, and very wealthy. A late writer hauing reckoned vp the commodities which this County doth affoard, M. Drayton. Song 19. concludes on this manner. If you esteeme not these, as things aboue the ground, Looke vnder, Roman burials, and the bones of Gyant-like found in Essex. where the Vrnes of ancient times are found: The Roman Emp rours Coynes, oft digd out of the dust, And warlike weapons, now consum'd with cankring rust, And huge and massy bones of mighty fearefull men, To tell the worlds full strength, what creatures liued then, When in her height of youth, the lustie fruitfull earth Brought forth her big-lim'd brood, euen Gyants in their birth. Neere to Showbery, Burials neere Showbery. in Rochford Hundred, are certaine hils, in which the bodies of the Danes there discomfited, and slaine in the raigne of Ed∣mund Ironside, lie buried in Essex. What way (saith Camden in Essex) this country looketh toward Cam∣bridgeshire, Barklow sheweth itselfe, well knowne now, by reason of foure little hils or Burries cast vp by mans hand: such as in old time were wont to be raised, Burials neere Barklow. as Tombes for Souldiers slaine, whose reliques were not easie to be found. But when a fifth and sixth of them were not long since digged downe, Ancient Tombes. three troughes of stone were found, and in them, broken bones of men, as I was informed. The country people say, that they were reared after a field there fought against the Danes, for, Dane wort, which with bloud-red berries, commeth vp here plenteously, they still call by no other name, then Danes-bloud, of the number of Danes that there were slaine, verily beleeuing that it bloometh from their bloud. The parish Church of Ashdown, or Assandun, giues buriall to the slaughtered bodies of many braue English Souldiers: Danes-bloud. Burials of the dead, in, and a∣bout Ashdown for Edmund, sirna∣med Ironside, King of England, hauing fought sixe battels with the Danes, within the compasse of one yeare, in which at the beginning hee had the better, putting them euer to rout, plaied here in this place his last prize, where he was so defeyted (by the meanes of false Edrick his counsell) that he lost the flower of the English Nobilitie. In memoriall of which Battell, king Canutus the Danish Conquerour built this Church at such time, when as vpon remorse and repentance for the bloud which he had shed, he erected Chappels in what part soeuer he had foughten any field, and shed Christian bloud. Of which my old Rimer Robert of Glocester. Knute moche louyd Eng ysshmen, and the loud thertoo, And holy Chyrche susteyned as hym ought to doo. And restoryd Abbeyes stroyed that wer befor And Chyrches lette arere that allwer inous forlor And Chyrches now he lette arere in places stedests most thar Where he had Battayles doo, and men yslaw ar As vpon Asshedonne and about ther Al for the soules. soulygs of hem that sleyne ther were. Certaine small hillocks are remayning neare to this Church at this day, out of which haue beene digged the bones of men; Armour, and the water chaines of horse bridles; as the Inhabitants told me. Claudius the Emperour (saith S Danyel ) had the honour of taking the whole Isle of Britaine to the Romane Empire, Battels and burialls of the dead, and about he an∣cient Ba hg of Maldon. which though thus wonne, was not, till a long time after, ouercome. For now the Britaines (vnder∣standing the misery of their dissociation: how their submission brought but the more oppression) colleague themselues against the Romanes, taking their occasion vpon the outrages, committed on the person and state of Queene Vaodicia, or Boudicea, widow of Prasutagus king of the Icenians, (the Inhabitants of Norfolke, Suffolke, Cambridge, and Huntingtonshires) a great and rich Prince, who (at his death) had left Nero his heire, and two daughters, hoping thereby to free his house from iniuries. But it fell out contrary; for, no sooner was he dead, but his kingdome was spoiled by the Cen urions, his house ransackt by slaues, his wife beaten, and his daughters rauished. Besides the chiefe men of the Icenians (as if all the region had beene giuen in prey) were rest of their goods, and the kings kinsmen estee∣med as captiues: with which contumely, and feare of greater mischiefe, they conspire with the Trinobants (the Inhabitants of Midlesex and Essex) and others (not yet inured to seruitude) to resume their liberty. And first set vpon the Garrisons of the Veteran Souldiers (whom they most hated) defeited the ninth Legion, whereof they slew all the foote, forced Cercalis the Legat, and leader to flight, and put to the sword seuenty thousand Ro∣manes and associates, inhabiting this municipall Towne Comolodunum, now Maldon, as also London and Verulam; before Suetonius the Gouer∣nour of the Prouince could assemble the rest of the dispersed forces, to make head against their armie, conducted by Vaodicia, who, (with her two daugh∣ter▪ brought into the field to moue compassion and reuenge) incites them to that noble and manly worke of liberty. Which to recouer, she protests to hold her selfe there but as one of the vulgar (without weighing her great honour and birth) resolued to winne, or dye. Many of their wiues were likewise there to be spectatours and incouragers of their husbands valour. But in the end Suetonius got the victory with the slaughter of fourescore thousand Britaines: of the Romanes onely foure hundred were slaine, and not many moe hurt, saith Tacitus, lib. Annal. 14. ca. 11. Vaodicia seeing the ouerthrow of her Army, was notwithstanding vnuan∣quished in her owne Noble Spirit, and scorning to be a spectacle in their Triumphs, or a vassall to their wills, after the example of Cleopatra, she made an end of her miseries and life by poyson: She was affoarded hono∣rable buriall, and so were the rest of her vanquished Armie there slaine ac∣cording to their qualitie, neare vnto the places where the battell was strucken. BISHOPS OF LON∣DON CANONIZED SAINTS. London. M Ellitus the first Bishop of this See, after the remouall of the Archbishopricke to Canterbury, had a shrine erected to his honour in this Church, as I haue touch∣ed before. In his time, and partly by his instigation, this Cathedrall Church was built by Ethelbert King of Kent. He was consecrated Bishop of London by Saint Austin, Archbishop of Canterbury, the yeare 604. In the gouernment whereof hee continued nineteene yeares; in which time and about the fourth yeare of his consecration, he went to Rome to conferre with Boniface the Pope about diuers things, and was by him honourably entertained. A yeare or two after his returne, died both Ethelbert King of Kent, as also Sebert of the East Angles, whom he had conuerted to the Christian Faith. G dwin. King Sebert left behinde him three wicked sonnes, that being neuer bap∣tized, came notwithstanding one day into the Church at Communion time, and asked the Bishop what hee meant that hee deliuered not of that same fi e bread vnto them as he was wont to their father Sebert, and did yet vnto the rest of the people. He answered, that if they would be washed in the water of life, as he was, and the rest of the people there present; then would he deliuer vnto them of this bread also: but otherwise, neither was it lawfull for him to deliuer, nor them to receiue it. This notwithstanding they would haue enforced him, and when they could not preuaile, were so enraged, as they expelled him their dominions, hardly holding their hands from doing him violence at that time. Hee, being thus exiled, went first vnto Laurence Archbishop of Canterbury, and finding him in little better case then himselfe was at London, departed into France, together with Iu∣stus Bishop of Rochester. Being sent for soone after by Laurence, it happen∣ed the same yeare that the same Laurence died, and hee was appointed to succeed him: where he sate about fiue yeares, euen vntill the day of his ex∣spiration. Of which an old Anonimall Manuscript, thus. To whome Melite than playnly gan succede, That fyve yere so rulyd the Chirche in ryght.

Gregory the Great, Bishop of Rome, writ to Mellitus concerning the pu∣rifying (but not the pulling downe) of Idolatrous Churches within these kingdomes; An Epistle well worthy the obseruation, which I haue read in Gotcelinus the Monke, who writes of the life and actions of Saint Austin, of other Bishops of the See of Canterbury, as also of diuers Saints in those primitiue times: and dedicates his workes to Anselme, Archbishop of Canterbury; Such was the letter of Gregory as followeth. Dilectissimo silio Mellito Abbati, Mss in lib. Sim. aurat. Gregorius servus seruorum Dei. Post discessionem Congregationis nostre que tecum est, valde sumus suspensi redditi, quia nichil de prosperitate vestri itineris audisse nos contigit. Cum ergo Deus omnipotens vos ad reuerendissimum fratrem nostrum Augustinum Episcopum perduxerit, dicite ei quid diu mecum de causa Anglorum co∣gitans tractaui, videlicet quia Fana Idolorum destrui in eadem gente mini∣me debeant, sed ipsa que in eis sunt Idola destruantur. Aqua benedicta in eis∣dem Fanis aspergatur, Altaria construantur Reliquie componantur, quia si Fana eadem bene constructa sunt, necesse est vt a cultu Demonum in obse∣quium veri Dei debeant commutari, vt dum gens ipsa eadem Fana sua no∣videt destrui, de corde erroren deponat, & Dominum verum cognoscens et adorans, ad loca que consuevit familiarius concurrat. Et quia Boues solent in sacrificio Demonum multos occidere, debet eis eciam de re hac aliqua solem∣nitas iramutari, vt die dedicationis vel natalicijs sanctorum Martyrum quo∣rum illic reliquie ponuntur, tabernacula sibi circa easdem Ecclesias que ex Fanis commutate sunt de ramis arborum faciant, & religiosis conuiuijs so∣lemnitatem celebrent Nec animalia immolent, sed ad laudem Dei in vsum suum animalia occidant, et Donatori omnium de sacietate sua gracias refe∣rent; vt dum eis aliqua externis gaudia res exuantur, ad interiora gaudia consentire facilius valeant.

Hereby we may see the pious aduise and great pollicie of this learned Father of the Church, for the conuerting of the misbeleeuing Pagans, or heathen people of this kingdome from Idolatrie, to the true worship of the euerliuing God. My forenamed Author Gotceline in the 53. Chapter of his first Booke, tells me that the names of the prime pillars of the English Church, and the especiall propagators of the Gospell, in these times, were engrauen vpon the Tarpeyan Rocke at Rome, of which number this my Mellitus is one of the principall. As appeares by these Latine Rimes following, sometime likewise engrauen or cut in the foresaid Rocke vnder each seuerall name to their further glory.

It is written of Mellitus, that when vpon a certaine time the Citie of Canterbury was by negligence set on fire, and began to waste and consume away by much increasing of the flames, so that no helpe of man, nor cast∣ing of water thereon, was able to quench or stay the same, the greatest part of the citie being at length almost burnt, and the furious flashes extending themselues euen vnto the Bishops place: this good Bishop seeing mans helpe now to faile, and trusting onely in the aide and succour of almighty God, commanded that he might be carried out of his house, and set against these fierce flames of fire, piercing and flying all round about. Now where the greatest rage of this burning was; there was the place of Martyrdome of the foure holy crowned Saints. Whan then the Bishop by his seruants was brought forth, and set in this place, here he began with prayer (sicke as he was, for he was often troubled with infirmities of body, and much grieued with the Gowte, Mellitu quen∣ched by his prayer, the fire burning the Citie of Can∣terbury. notwithstanding euer whole and sound of minde) to driue away the perill of the fire: which the stout strength of strong men with much labour could not before bring to passe. And behold the winde that blew from the South, whereby this fire was first kindled and blasted abroad (now suddenly bent against the South) first tempered his blasts; for feare of hurting the places right ouer in the other side, and after quite quenching the flames, ceasing and extinguishing the fire, made all calme and well againe. And truly this good man of God which did fer∣uently alway burne with the fire of inward charity, and was wont with his often prayers and holy exhortations to driue from himselfe, and all his, the danger of ghostly temptations, and trouble by spirits of the aire, might now iustly preuaile against the winde, and easily cease these temporall flames, and obtaine that they should neuer hurt him nor his. See more of him before in Canterbury. S. Ceada or Cedda. After the death of Mellitus, the Church of London was long with∣out a Pastor, euen vntill that Segebert the sonne of Segebert (surnamed the little) obtaining the Kingdome of the East Saxons, by the perswasion of Oswin, King of Northumberland, became a Christian, and procured Ceada a vertuous and godly Priest, to be consecrate Bishop of his country: which was done in the holy Iland, 3. c. 2 neere to Barwicke, by Finan, Bishop of Dur∣ham, from whence he returned to this his Diocesse, and began with more authoritie to perfect the worke hee had already begun, erecting in diuers places, Churches, making Priests and Deacons, who in preaching & bapti∣sing▪ might assist him, Tilbu y, Cities. especially in the Cities of Ithancester & Tileburg, the one standing vpon the Thames, the other vpon a branch thereof, called Pant, in which two places diuers newly assembling together christened, he instructed them after the rules of religious persons, as farre as their tender capacity could then conceiue. And hereby way of digression, let me speake somewhat of this small hamlet of Tilbury, in ancient time the seat of the Bishops of London; and no question in those daies, when as Bishop Cedda by baptisme ingra ted the East Saxons in the Church of Christ, a prettie faire citie, howsoeuer it consisteth now onely of a few cottages, much honoured by that famous, religious, Sir Horace V e Ba on of Til∣bury. and fortunate great Commander in the warres, Sir Horace Vere Knight, Lord Vere of Tilbury. Of whom, and of his elder brother, Sir Francis Vere Knight, deceased, and honourably buried, like (as hee was) an expert and valiant warriour; in the Abbey of Westminster; a late Poet hath thus written. Then liu'd those valiant Veres, both men of great command, In our imployments long: Sir Francis, and si Ho ace Vere▪ M. .

Erconwald. the sonne of Offa King of the East Saxons, and the fourth Bishop of this Diocesse, was likewise (as I haue already spoken) canoni∣zed; of whom venerable Bede thus writes. Bed. lib. 4 ca. 6. At that time (saith he) when Sebba and Sigher ruled the East Saxons, the Archbishop (which was Theodore ) appointed ouer them, Erconwald to be their Bishop in the Citie of London: the life and conuersation of which man, both before he was Bishop, and after, was reported and taken for most holy, as also euen yet the signes and tokens of heauenly vertues and mira∣cles doe well declare. Cures by Saint Erconwald, Horse-licter. For vntill this day, his Horse-licter being kept and re∣serued by his Schollers, wherein he was wont to be carried when hee was sicke and weake, doth daily cure such as haue agues, or are diseased any o∣therwise. And not onely the sicke persons that are put vnder, or laid by the Horse-licter to be so healed; but also the chippes and pieces that are cut off from it, and brought to sicke folkes, are wont to bring them speedie reme∣die. This and many other the miracles wrought by him (if wee may be∣leeue Capgraue ) was the cause of his canonization: questionlesse he was a deuout and vertuous man, and bestowed his patrimony in the building of two Monasteries, one for Monkes at Chertsey in Surrey, another for Nunnes at Barking in Essex, of which before. Thus much then here for a conclusion as followeth. Him Erkenwald ensues th'East English Offa's sonne, His Fathers Kingly Court who for a Crosiar fled, Whose workes such fame him wonne for holinesse that dead, Time him enshrin'd in Pauls (the mother of that See) Which with reuenues large, and priuiledges he Had wondrously endow'd: to goodnesse so affected, That he those Abbeyes great from his owne power erected, At Chertsey neere to Thames, and Barking famous long. S. Theodred. Theodred, Bishop of the Diocesse, may challenge a place in this my Ka∣lender, for that he was sirnamed the Good, pro praerogatiua virtutum, for the preheminence of his vertues, saith Malmesbury, lib. 2. de Pontif. An∣glor. he flourished about the yeare, 900. he was buried vnder a high tombe by the window of the vault going downe into S. Faiths Church. S. Egwulfe. Of Egwulfe and his Shrine, I haue already written all that I know. S. Richard. Richard Fitz-neale had his Shrine in S. Pauls Church, but vpon what ground, or for what reason he was thus much honoured, I doe not learne. He was the sonne of Nigellus, or Neale, Bishop of Ely; and was made Trea∣surer of England by the purchase of his father the foresaid Nigellus. Ex lib. Elien. in bib. Co . Richar∣dus filius Nigelli Episcopi Eliens. pro quo Nigellus pater emit officium The∣saurij a Rege auaro pro Quadragint. Marcis, pro quibus pecunijs Nigellus pa∣ter spoliauit Ecclesiam Eliens. Thesauro suo et ornamentis. This purchase was made when as the King, Henry the second, went to the wars of To∣lous. It is further written in the booke of Ely, that this Richard Fitz-neale, after the buriall of Nigellus his father (being also an enemy to the Church of Ely as his father had beene before) made hast to passe ouer the Seas to King Henry the second, fearing that some euill would be prepared against him, if the Church should haue sent any thither before him: At whose comming to the King, he accused the Monkes of Ely of many things, and did therewith so edge the King against them, that the King sending into England, charged by Wunnecus, one of his Chaplaines, that the Prior of Ely should be deposed, and the Monkes with all their goods to be proscri∣bed and banished. This man being Treasurer to King Henry the second, the treasure of the said Henry the second at his death, came vnto one hundred thousand markes; notwithstanding the excessiue charges of the King many waies. This Richard (being Bishop of London, by the name of Richard the third, and the Kings Treasurer) was chosen for the gouernement of this See in the yeare of our redemption, one thousand, one hundred, eighty and nine, being the first yeare of King Richard the first, and was consecra∣ted Bishop at Lambeth, by Baldwine, Archbishop of Canterbury, in the yeare of Christ, one thousand, one hundred, ninety: he died the fourth of the Ides of September, in the yeare of grace, one thousand, one hundred, ninety and eight, being the ninth yeare of King Richard the first, as I haue it out of the Catalogue of Treasurers of England, collected by Francis Thinne. He bestowed much vpon the building of his Church, S. Pauls, as also vpon other Edifices belonging to his See, which was the cause, I coniecture, wherefore the Shrine was erected to his memory. Many miracles (saith Mat. Paris ) were wrought at the tombe of Roger, S. Roger. sirnamed the Blacke, the foure and fortieth Bishop of this Diocesse, who lieth buried neere to the preaching place in Saint Pauls Church, vnder a monument of grey marble, of which, as also of him, I haue partly spoken before. Godwin, Bishop of Hereford, out of the foresaid M. Paris saith, that this Roger was a reuerend man, religious, learned, painfull in preaching, e∣loquent, a great House-keeper, and of very gentle and curteous behauiour: whereunto he might haue added (as it is in my Author) that hee was also stout and couragious. For, Rustandus the Popes Nuntio being earnest in a conuocation for setting forward a certaine prolling deuise to scrape vp money for his master, he not onely withstood him openly, but cried out vpon the vnreasonable and shamelesse couetousnesse of the Court of Rome, and was the onely means of staying the course of that exaction. For reuenge hereof, not long after they began to frame an accusatiō against him at Rome, alledging matters altogether false and friuolous. It forced him to trauell thither, and cost him great summes of money before he could rid his hands of that brable. The yeare 1233. Walter Mauclerke, Bishop of Carlile, taking ship to passe ouer the seas, was hindered by some of the Kings Officers, for that he had no licence to depart the Realme. These Officers for so doing, hee excom∣municated, and riding straight vnto the Court, certified the King what he had done, and there renewed the same sentence againe. About the same time, the King gaue commandement for the apprehen∣ding of Hubert de Burgo Earle of Kent, who hauing sodaine notice there∣of at midnight, got him vp, and fled into a Church in Essex. They to whom the businesse was committed, finding him vpon his knees before the high Altar, with the Sacrament in one hand, and a crosse in the other, carried him away neuerthelesse vnto the Tower of London. The Bishop taking this to bee a great violence and wrong offered to holy Church, would neuer leaue the King (which was Henry the third, a King indeed very re∣ igious) vntill he had caused the Earle to bee carried vnto the place from whence he was fetcht; which was thought to bee a meanes of sauing the Earles life. For though order was taken he should not scape thence, yet it gaue the Kings wrath a time to coole, and himselfe leisure to make proofe of his innocency. By reason whereof, he was afterward restored to the Kings fauour and former places of honour. But the story here followeth, which is also annexed to his tombe, that a∣boue all others giues the truest testimony of his religious, vigerous, and vndaunted masculine spirit, Mat. Paris, an. 1230. Vpon the day of the conuersion of Saint Paul, while Roger, Bishop of London was at high Masse within the Church of Saint Paul in London, a sudden darknesse ouershadowed the Quire, and therewith came such a tempest of thunder and lightning, A strange Tempest. that the people there assembled, thought verily the Church and Steeple had come downe vpon their heads. There came moreouer such a filthy sauour and stinke withall, that partly for feare, and partly for that they might not abide the sauour, they voyded the Church, falling on heapes one vpon another, as they sought to get out of the same. The Vicars and Canons forsooke their Deskes, so that the Bi∣shop remained there onely with one Deacon that serued him at Masse. Af∣terward when the aire began to clear vp, the people returned into the Church, and the Bishop, qui remansit intrepidus, who remained all the time nothing at all abashed, went forward and finished the Masse. M. D. Polyol. Song. 24. Thus Roger hath a roome in this our Sainted throng, Who by his words and workes, so taught the way to heauen As that great name to him, sure vainely was not giuen. Now for a conclusion, if you desire greatly to know the greatnesse of this christian name of Roger, as the Poet here in this place seemes to call it, con∣sult with Verstegan in his Etymologies of the ancient Saxon proper names of men and women, and he will tell you that Roger was at the first, Rugard or Rougard, and afterwards Rugar, and with vs lastly Roger. Rou or Ru is our ancient word for rest, repose, or quietnesse, gard, to keepe, or con∣serue, so as Rugard (now Roger ) is a keeper or conseruer of rest and quiet∣nesse. Such a keeper, such a conseruer of peace and quietnesse, was this our Bishop Roger, whom I leaue to his eternall rest and repose, and so take my leaue of this sometime his Diocesse. Here endeth the Diocesse of London: ANCIENT FVNERALL MONV∣MENTS WITHIN THE Diocesse of NORVVICH. In Suffolke. Dunwich. T HE first seate of the Bishops of this Diocesse was at Dunwich in Suffolke, Felix the first Bishop of Dunwich, or Dunmok. Harding. ca: 91. and the first Bishop thereof was Felix, a Burgundian. At Dunmok than was Felix fyrst Byshop Of Estangle, and taught the Chrysten ayth, That is full hye in heuen I hope. His happie comming into this kingdome, happened vpon this occasion, as followeth. Sebert, or Sigebert, king of the East Angles, a man in all points learned, and most Christian, who whilest his brother was yet liuing, being himselfe banished into France by his father Redwald, Beda lib. 2. ca. 15 Hist. Eccl. was there baptised and instru∣cted in the Faith; of which faith he laboured to make all his Realme par∣takers, as soone as he came vnto the Crowne. Whose good endeuour here∣in, the foresaid Felix did most earnestly fauour, and with great praise ap∣plie himselfe. Who when he came from Burgundy (where he was borne, and tooke holy orders) into Britaine to Honorius the Archbishop, vnto whom hee opened his desire and purpose, which was, to preach the word of God vnto the foresaid East Angles. The Archbishop gladly gaue him licence, and sent him forth to sow the seed of eternall saluation, in the mis∣beleeuing hearts of the people of that countrey. His zeale and vertuous de∣sire proued not in vaine: For, this holy husbandman, and happie tiller of the spirituall field, found in that Nation plentifulnesse of fruite, and increase of people that beleeued him. For he brought all that Prouince (being now deliuered by his helpe from their long iniquitie and vnhappinesse) vnto the faith and workes of Iustice, and in the end to the reward of perpetuall blisse and happinesse for euer, according to the good abodement of his name, which in latine is called Felix, and in our English tongue, soundeth Happy. He was made Bishop about the yeare of our redemption, 630. and chose Dunwich for his Episcopall Chaire; being a Citie in foregoing ages, spacious, much frequented, and well peopled with inhabitants. Famous also for a Mint therein, some men of the towne can yet shew of the coines, which are sterling pence, with this inscription, Ciuitatis Dunwic. But now by a certaine peculiar spite and enuy of Nature, that suffereth the greedy sea to haue what it will, and encroch still without all end, the greatest part thereof is violently carried away with the waues, and it lieth (as it were) desolate. The common fame and report of the Inhabitants is, that before the towne came to decay, Two and fifty religious st ctures, as many wind∣mil , and as many toppe ships in Dun∣wich. Recorda Dun. there belonged thereunto, two and fifty religious houses, as parish Churches, Priories, Hospitals, and Chappels; as many Windmils, and as many toppe Ships. But certaine it is, as appeareth by manifest and sound Record which I haue seene (saith Stow ) that euen of late time, there was within the said towne, sixe parish Churches, two hou∣ses of Friers, an house which had beene of Templars, two Hospitals, and three Chappels: foure of these parish Churches are now of late swallowed vp in the Sea, and but two of them remaining on the land, to wit, Saint Peters, and All Saints. The Inhabitants of Dunwich desiring succour for their Towne, against the rage of the Sea, affirme that a great piece of a Forrest, sometime thereby, is deuoured and turned to the vse of the Sea. Camd. in Suss. In the raigne of William the Conquerour (saith Camden ) Dunwich had in it two hundred and sixe and thirty Burgesses, an hundred poore people: it was valued at fiftie pounds, and threescore thousand Herings of gift, for so we reade in Domesday booke. In the raigne of Henry the second, as William of Newborough writeth, It was a towne of good note, and full stored with sundry kindes of ri∣ches. At which time when England was all on a light fire with new stirres and broiles, this towne was so fortified, that it made Robert, Earle of Leicester afraid, who with his armie ouer-ranne all the parts thereabout at his plea∣sure. But to draw neerer to these our times, I haue read and copied out a large Treatise of Dunwich, (now in the custody of Sir Simonds D'Ewes Knight) of which so much in this place as I finde to bee any way pertinent to the premisses, and my purpose. This treatise or relation of Dunwich, was writ∣ten in the raigne of Queene Mary, and sent to one Master Dey, from a friend of his, whose name is there concealed. The state of Dunwich since the foregoing time. Six parish Churches. Sir, &c. Sixe parish Churches were anciently in Dunwich, the first was Saint Leonards, now drowned in the sea; the second, Saint Peters, now standing; the third, Saint Iohns, likewise swallowed vp of the Sea; the fourth, Saint Martins, now lying vnder the waues; the fift, Saint Nicholas, now altogether shipwrackt; and the sixt, the Parish of All Saints, now stan∣ding and remaining. Two houses of Friers. Also there was two houses of Friers, very faire Chur∣ches and building, walled round about with a stone wall, with diuers faire gates, as yet there may be seene; the which grey Friers was of the order of Saint Francis, and called the Friers Minors: and the blacke Friers were of the order of Saint Dominicke, (and were called the Friers Preachers. Also there was in the said Towne, One house of Templa s. an ancient and very old Church, cal∣led the Temple of our Lady; the which Church, by report, was in the Iewes time, and was valted ouer. And the roofe of the same Church, and also the Isles, were leaded all ouer. And it was a Church of great priui∣ledge and pardon in those daies, and was indowed with diuers Rents, Te∣nements, Houses, Lands, and other profits and commodities, both free and coppie: as well in Donwiche, Westelton, Dyngle, &c. as also in diuers other places, &c. And commonly there was kept a Court, called Don∣wiche Temple Court, on the day of All Soules, for the leuying and gathe∣ring vp of the yeerely reuenue of the same. Also there is in the said Towne, Two Hospitals two Hospitals, the one is called Saint Iames, which Church is a great one, and a faire large one after the old fashi∣on, and diuers tenements, houses, and lands to the same belonging, to the vse of the poore, sicke, and impotent people there. But now lately, greatly decaied and hindred by euill Masters of the said Hospitall, and other euilly disposed couetous persons, which did sell away diuers lands and rents from the said Hospitall, to the great hinderance of the poore people of the said Hospitall, as plainely it is to be proued. The other Hospitall was of the holy Trinitie, The couetou ∣nesse of the Masters and Officers. The destructi∣on of both Hospitals. and was, and is, called the Mason Dieu, whereof the Church is now pulled downe, and decaied by the meanes of such euill Masters and couetous persons, as decayed the other Hospitall. But there is yet diuers tenements, houses, lands, and rents, remai∣ning to the vse of the poore of the same Hospitall. The which Mason Dien was an house of great priuiledge, and a place exempt, and there was a very little proper house, and a proper lodging for the Masters of the same, for the time being to dwell in. As there hath beene masters of the same Mason Dieu, in times past that hath beene worshipfull, viz. one there was of late daies, a Master of Arte, and another that was a Squyre, and such like, &c. I would to God these iniuries and wrongs done to these two poore Hospi∣tals might be restored, and reformed againe to their former estate. For, sure∣ly, whosoeuer shall doe it, shall doe a good worke before God; I pray God bring it to passe, Amen. Also there was in the said Towne of Donwiche, Three Chap∣pel ▪ three Chappels, wher∣of one was of Saint Antony, another of Saint Francis, and a third was of Saint Katherine. The which three Chappels were put downe, when all the houses of Religion were put downe. But you shall further vnderstand, that the common fame of a great num∣ber of credible persons is, and hath beene for a long time past, that there hath beene in the Towne of Donwiche before any decay came vnto it, fiftie and two parish Churches, houses of Religion, Hospitals and Chap∣pels, and other such like; as many wind-mils, and as many toppe Ships. Also I thinke you doe remember the manner, forme, and fashion of the building and making of Saint Iohns Church, and Saint Nicholas Church, how they were close sled both North and south, and the steeples in the middest like Cathedrall Churches now vsed, and as it seemeth, as the old manner of Cathedrall Churches then was. And most likest so was the Church of Saint Felix : for certainly one of these three Churches, was the Bishops seat of Donwiche, The Cathedral Church vncer∣taine. if one of them were not after another, as the Sea drowned them. And further you shall certainly vnderstand, that when Saint Iohns Church was taken downe, A strange and ancient buriall of a Bishop. there lay a very plaine faire Grauestone in the Chancell; and when it was raised and taken vp, next vnder the same Grauestone was a great hollow stone, hollowed after the fashion of a man, for a man to lye in: and therein a man lying with a paire of Bootes vpon his legges, the forepart of the feete of them peicked, after a strange fashion, and a paire of Challices of course mettall lying vpon his breast, the which was thought to be one of the Bishops of Donwiche, but when they touched and stirred the same dead body, it fell, and went all to powder and dust. And although these aforesaid three old Churches were not sumptuous, great, & very faire, after the manner & fashion of Cathedral Churches now vsed, yet it seemeth they might serue in those daies very well; for it plainely appeareth in the book of the description of England, and in the title of Bi∣shoprickes and their Sees, the thirteenth chapter, whereas these words fol∣lowing are said. Bishops Seats anciently what they were. Take heede, for in the beginning of holy Church in Eng∣land, Bishops ordained, and had their Sees in low places and simple, that were conueniable and meete for contemplation and deuotion, &c. But in King William the Conquerours time by doome of Law Canon, it was otherwise ordained, that Bishops should remoue, and come out of small townes, and to haue their Sees in great Cities. By meanes whereof, it see∣meth that the towne of Donwiche being then greatly decayed, and also then likely more and more to decay (as it hath done indeed) from a great citie (as some doe say) or at the least from a very great ancient Towne, to a little small Towne, the Bishops seat of Donwich, was remoued from Donwich to Elmham, and Thetford, and afterward to the Citie of Nor∣wich, whereas it yet remaineth. A Mint in Dunwich. There was a Mint in Dunwich; for, one Master Holliday told mee that he had a grote, whose superscription on the one side, was Ciuitas Donwic. Diuers other things he told me of to make it a citie. The Treatise is much longer, but enough is already deliuered. The succession of the Bishops of Dunwich, is set downe by Bishop God∣win, to which I refer my Reader. The foundation of the Blacke Friers in Dunwich. This religious Structure was founded by Sir Roger de Holishe, Knight, of the order you haue heard before, of the time, dedication, value, or sur∣render, I finde not any thing. Persons of note buried in the Church of this Monastery, were as followeth: Burials in the blacke Friers at Dunwich. Sir Roger de Holishe, Knight, the foresaid founder▪ Sir Raufe Vfford, and Dame Ione his wife. Sir Henry Laxiffeld Knight. Dame Ione de Har ile. Dame Ada Crauene. Dame Ione Weyland, Sister of the Earle of Suffolke. Iohn Weyland, and Ione his wife. Thomas, sonne of Richard Brews, Knight. Dame Alice, wife of Sir Walter Hardishall. Sir Walkin Hardesfield. Austin Valeyus, Raph Wingfeld, Knight. Richard Bokyll of Leston, and Alice, and Alice his wiues. Sir Henry Harnold Knight and Fryer. The grey Friers of Dunwich was founded first by Richard Fitz-Iohn and Alice his wife, in the blacke Friers of Dunwich. and after by King Henry the third: of which I haue no further knowledge. Herein lay interred the bodies of Sir Robert Valence, the Heart of Dame Hawise Ponyngs. Dame Ideu of Ylketishall. Sir Peter Mellis, and Dame Anne his wife. Dame Dunne his mother. Iohn Francans, and Margaret his wife. Dame Bert of Furniuall . . . . Austin of Cales, and Ione his wife. Iohn Falley , and Beatrix his wife, Augustine his sonne . . . . Wilex es. Sir Hubert Dernford. Katherine, wife of William Phellip, Margaret, wife of Richard Phellip. Peter Codum. I had the notes of these buried in these Monasteries, as also of diuers o∣ther Monasteries in Suffolke and Norfolke, out of the painefull collections of William le Neue Esquire, Yorke Herauld, truely copied out of the anci∣ent originals thereof, remaining in his custody. Bury Saint Edmunds, or Saint Edmundsbury. This Town seemeth (saith Camden ) to haue been of famous memory, con∣sidering that▪ when Christian Religion began to spring vp in this tract, king Sigebert here founded a Church, The foundati∣on of the first Church in Bury. The first foun∣dation of the Abbey by the common peo∣ple. and it was called Villam Regiam, that is, a royall towne. But after that the people had translated hither the body of Edmund, that most christian King, whom the Danes with exquisite tor∣ments had put to death, and built in honour of him, a very great Church, wrought with a wonderfull frame of timber: it began to be called Edmun∣di Burgus, commonly Saint Edmundsbury, and more shortly, Bury. But es∣pecially since that King Canutus, for to expiate the sacrilegious impietie of his Father Suenus against this Church, being often affrighted with a visi∣on of the seeming-ghost of Saint Edmund, The second by K Can e. built it againe of a new worke, enriched it, offered his owne Crowne vnto the holy Martyr, brought vnto it, Monkes with their Abbot, and gaue vnto it many faire and large Man∣nors, and among other things, the Towne it selfe full and whole: ouer which, the Monkes themselues by their Seneschall had rule and iurisdi∣ction. Thus Knuts Charter began. In nomine Poliarchie Iesu Christi saluatoris. Ex Arch Turr. Lend. Ego Knut Rex totius Albio∣nis Insule aliarumque nationum plurimarum, in Cathedra regali promotus, cum concilio & decreto Archiepiscoporum, Episcoporum, Abbatum, Comitum, aliorumque omnium fidelium meorum, elegisanciendum & perpeti stabilimen∣to ab omnibus confirmandum, vt Monasterium quod Bederics Court, Farme, or mansion house. Budrices Yurthe nun∣cupatur sit per omne euum Monachorum gregibus deputatum ad inhabitan∣dum, &c. After a long recitall of his many donations, corroborations, priuiledges, and confirmations of former grants, he ends with an Additament, of fish and fishing. Huic libertati concedo additamentum, scilicet maritimos pisces qui mihi contingere debent annualiter per Thelonei lucrum, et Piscationem quam Vlskitel habuit in Pilla. et omnia iura, &c. These gifts, to this Abbey, as to the most of all others, were finally con∣cluded with a fearefull curse to the infringers thereof, and a blessing to all such that did any way better her ample endowments: the Charter is signed with the marke, which is the crosse, and the consent of thirty and fiue wit∣nesses, of which a few, as followeth. ✚ Ego Knut Rex, &c. hoc priuilegium iussi componere, & compositum cum signo Dominice crucis confirmando impressi. ✚ Ego Aelgifa Regina omni alacritate mentis hoc confirmaui. ✚ Ego Wuls anus Archiepiscopus consensi. ✚ Ego Adelnodus confirma i &c. Camd. in Suss. After Knut, one Haruey, the Sacrist comming of the Norman bloud, compassed the Burgh round about with a wall, whereof there remaine still some few reliques, and Abbot Newport walled the Abbey. The Bishop of Rome endowed it with very great immunities, and among other things granted, That the said place should be subiect to no Bishop in any matter, and in matters lawfull to depend vpon the pleasure and direction of the Archbishop, which is yet obserued at this day. And now by this time the Monkes abounding in wealth, erected a new Church, of a sumptuous and stately building, enlarging it euery day more then other with new workes, and whiles they laid the Foundation of a new Chappell, in the raigne of Edward the first, There were found (as E∣uersden a Monke of this place writeth) the walles of a certaine old Church, Euersden. built round, so, as that the Altar stood (as it were) in the mids, and we veri∣ly thinke, saith he, it was that which was first built to Saint seruice. But what manner of towne this was, and how great the Abbey was while it stood, Leland. heare Leland speake, who saw it standing. The Sunne, saith he, hath not seene either a Citie more finely seated, (so delicately standeth it vpon the easie ascent, or hanging of an hill, and a little riuer runneth downe on the East side thereof) or a goodlier Abbey; whether a man indif∣ferently consider, either the endowment with reuenues, or the largenesse, or the incomparable magnificence thereof. A man that saw the Abbey would say verily it were a Citie: so many gates there are in it, and some of brasse, so many Towers, & a most stately Church: vpon which, attend Now but two. three others also standing gloriously in one and the same Church yard; all of pas∣sing fine and curious workmanship. If you demand how great the wealth of this Abbey was, a man could hard∣ly tell, & namely how many gifts and oblations were hung vpon the tombe alone of Saint Edmund: and besides, there came in, out of lands and reue∣nue , a thousand, fiue hundred and threescore pounds of old rent by the yeare. The Abbot and Couent of the Monasterie, gouerned the Townesmen and all within Banna Leuca, within the bounds of a mile from the towne, by their Steward, who euer gaue the oath to the new elect Alderman: which was deliuered in these words following: copied out of a Lieger booke sometimes belonging to the said Abbey. The oath of the Alderman of Bury. Ye schall swere that ye schall bere yow trewly and fethfully in the Office of the Aldermanscipe of this Town of Bury; ayens the Abbot and the Couent of this place, and all her mynistris: ye scall bere, kepe and maintaine Pees to yowre powere, and ye schall nor thyng appropre, nor accroche that longyth to the said Abbot and Couent▪ nor take vpon the thyngis that long on to the Office of the Baylishchipp of the seyd Town. Alsoo that ye schall not pro∣cure be yow, nor be noon othir, priuyly, nor openly ony thyng vn∣lawfull, that myght be harme or damage onto the seyd Abbot and Couent, nor suffre to be don, but that ye schall be redy to meyn∣teyn and defende them and here mynystris yn all the ryghtis and customs that of dew long on to them, inasmoche as ye mey leyful∣ly do. Thees artycles and poyntis ye schall obserue and kepe the tym that ye stand in this office. So help yow God, and all hys Seynts, and be this Boke. Notwithstanding this oath, The broile betweene the Townesmen, the Abbot, and Couent of Bury. the Townesmen, now and then, fell so foule vpon the Abbot and Couent, that they imprisoned the Abbot, strucke the Monkes with the Bailiffes and Officers belonging to the Abbey, assaul∣ted the Abbey gates, set fire on them, and burned them with diuers houses neere adioyning, that belonged to the Monasterie. They burnt a Mannor of the Abbots, called Holdernesse Barne; with two other Mannors, called the Almoners barne, and Haberdone, also the Granges that stood with∣out the South-gate, and the Mannor of Westlie, in which places they burnt in corne and graine, to the value of a thousand pounds. They entred into the Abbey court, and burnt all the houses on the north side; as Stables, Brewhouses, Garners, and other such necessary houses: They burned the Mote hall, and Bradford hall, with the new hall, and diuers Chambers and Sollers to the same halls annexed, with the Chappell of Saint Laurence, at the end of the Hospitall hall; also the Mannor of Eldhall, the Mannor of Horninger, with all the corne and graine within and about the same. Assembling themselues together in warlike order and aray, they assaul∣ted the said Abbey, brake downe the gates, windowes, and dores, entred the house by force, and assailing certaine Monkes and seruants that belon∣ged to the Abbot, did beat, wound, and euill intreat them; brake open a number of chests, coffers, and forssets, tooke out Chalices of gold and sil∣uer, bookes, vestments, and other ornaments of the Church, beside a great quantity of rich plate, and other furniture of household apparell, armour, and other things, beside fiue hundred pounds in ready coyne, and also three thousand Florens of gold. All these things they tooke and carried away, together with diuers Charters, Writings, and Miniments; as three Char∣ters of King Knute, foure Charters of King Hardicanute, one Charter of King Edward the Confessor, two Charters of King Henry the first, and o∣ther two Charters of King Henry the third; which Charters concerned as well the Foundation of the same Abbey, as the grants and confirmati∣ons of the possessions and liberties thereunto belonging. Many more are the outrages committed at seuerall times by the Townes∣men, against these cloistered brethren; which are recorded in the foresaid Lieger booke of S. Edmunds bury: all which to relate, would seeme incre∣dible, and make this my digression, I confesse, too much ouerlong and trou∣blesome, thus then to returne. The Dedication, the Foundation, the time, and the Founders, and the value of this Religious structure may be partly gathered by the premisses; it was replenished with Monkes Benedictines, or as some say, Cluniacks: it was surrendred into the Kings hands the fourth of Nouember, in the one and thirtith yeare of Henry the eight. Reliques in the Abbey Church, out of a booke called Compend. Com. pertorum, in the treasurie of the Exche∣quer. Amongst other Reliques, the Monkes of this Church had Saint Ed∣munds shirt; certaine drops of Saint Stephens bloud which sprung from him at such time as he was stoned, and some of the coles with which Saint Laurence was broiled. They had certaine parings of the flesh of diuers holy Virgins, and a si∣new of Saint Edmund laid vp in boxes. They had some Skuls of ancient Saints and Martyrs, amongst which was one of Saint Petronill, or Pernell, which the country people were taught to lay to their heads, thereby to be cured of all kinde of agues. They had the bootes of Saint Thomas of Canterbury, and the sword of Saint Ed∣mund. Aniles Fabulae. It was in vse here amongst the Monkes, as often as they desired raine, to carry with them, in their Processions, a coffin wherein the bones of Saint Botolph were inclosed, hoping thereby the sooner to haue pleasant shoures to refresh the drie parched earth. They had certaine waxe candles, which euer and onely they vsed to light in wheat-seeding; these they likewise carried about their wheat grounds, beleeuing verily that hereby neither Darnell, Tares, nor any o∣ther noisome weedes would grow that yeere amongst the good corne. These Reliques they had, and many more, which wrought many strange effects, by their owne relation. The Abbots of this house were Barons of the Parliament. But now to come to the burials of certaine worthy personages in this Ab∣bey Church of Bury, and first. S. Edmund, King and Mar∣tyr. Here lay sometimes enshrined, the sacred Remaines of Edmund, King of the East Angles, and Martyr; who was the sonne of one Alkmund, a Prince of great power in these parts. In the raigne of this King Edmund, Hungar, & Hubba, two Danish Captaines, with an innumerable multitude of Heathen Danes, entred the Land at the mouth of Humber, and from thence inuaded Nottingham, Yorke and Northumberland, where (with∣out respect of age or sexe) they laid all wast, Speed Hist ca. 11 and left the Land, whence they departed, like to a desolate wildernesse. From thence they came with the like furie into Edmunds territories, and sacked Thetford, a frequent citie in those daies: but hee not able to withstand their violence, fled into his Castle at Framingham, wherein he was of them besieged, and lastly taken in a village, then called now Hoxon. Heglisdune, of a wood bearing the same name, or rather yeelded himselfe to their torments, to saue more christian bloud; for it is recorded, that because of his most constant Faith and profession, those Pagans first beat him with bats, then scourged him with whips, he still cal∣ling vpon the name of Iesus: for rage whereof, they bound to a stake, and with their arrowes shot him to death; and cutting off his head, con∣temptuously threw it into a bush, after he had raigned ouer the East An∣gles the space of sixteene yeares. Camden, out of Abbo Floriacensis, saith, that the bloudy Danes hauing bound this most christian King to a tree, for that he would not renounce christianity, shot him with sharpe arrowes all his body ouer, augmenting the paines of his torment, with continuall piercing him with arrow after arrow, and thus inflicted wound vpon wound, so long as one arrow could stand by another, as a Poet of midle time versified of him: I am loca vulneribus desunt, nec dum furiofis Tela, sed hyberna grandine plura volant. Though now no place was left for wound, yet arrowes did not faile, These surious wretches, still they flie thicker then winter haile. His body and head, after the Danes were departed, were buried at the same royall Towne, as Abbo termes it, where Sigebert the East Anglean King, and one of his predecessors at his establishing of Christianity, built a Church, and where afterwards (in honour of him) was built another most spatious, and of a wonderfull frame of Timber, and the name of the Towne vpon that occasion of his buriall, called vnto this day, Saint Edmundsbury: This Church and place, (to speake more fully to that which I haue written before) Suenus the Pagan Danish King, in impiety and fury, burned to ashes. But when his sonne Canute, or Knute, had made conquest of this Land, and gotten possession of the English Crowne, terrified and a∣frighted (as saith the Legend) with a vision of the seeming Saint Edmund, in a religious deuotion to expiate his Fathers sacriledge, built it anew most sumptuously, enriched this place with Charters and Gifts, and offered his owne Crowne vpon the Martyrs Tombe; of whom for a conclusion, take these verses following. Vtque cruore suo Gallos Dionisius ornat Ex lib. Abb. de Russ. in bib. Col. Grecos Demetrius; gloria quisque sui : Sic nos Edmundus nulli virtute secundus; Lux patet & patrie gloria magna sue. Sceptra manum, Diadema capud, sua purpura corpus, Ornat ei sed plus vincula, mucro, cruor. The 20. day of Nouember, S. Robert Mar∣tyr, ex lib. Abb. de chateris in bib Cot. in our Calender, was kept holy in remem∣brance of this King and Martyr. Puer Robertus apud Sanctum Edmundum a Iudeis fuit Martirazatus, 4. Id. Iunij An. 1179. et illic sepultus. Alanus Comes Britannie obijt An. 1093. & his iacet ad hostium australe Sancti Edmundi: Alan, Earle of Britaine and Kichmond. Milles Catal. Rich. ex eod, lib. de chateris. This Allan here buried (or as some will haue it in the monastery of Rhe∣don) sirnamed the Red, or Fergaunt, was the sonne of Eudo, Earle of Bri∣taine, and entred England with William the Conquerour (his Father in Law.) To whom the said Conquerour gaue the honour and County of Ed∣wyn, within the County and Prouince of Yorke, by his Charter in these words: I William, (sirnamed Bastard, King of England) giue and grant to thee my Nephew Allan, Earle of Britaine, and to thy heyres for euer, all those Villages, Townes, and Lands which were late in possession of Earle Edwin in Yorkeshire, with knights fees, Churches, and other liberties and customes, as freely and honourably as the said Edwyn held them. Giuen at the siege before Yorke. Alban being a man of an high spirit, and desirous to gouerne the Prouince entirely which he had receiued, The building of Richmond Castle. built a strong Ca∣stle by Gillingham (a village which he possessed) by which he might de∣fend himselfe, not onely against the English, who were spoiled of their goods and lands, but also against the fury and inuasions of the Danes. When the worke was finished, he gaue it the name of Richmond, of pur∣pose, either for the greatnesse and magnificence of the place, or for some Castle in little Britaine of the same name. Tho. Plantaginet Earle of Nor∣folke. Here sometimes, vnder a goodly Monument in the Quire of this Abbey Church, lay interred the body of Thomas, surnamed of Brotherton, the place of his birth, the fifth sonne of Edward the first, after the Conquest, king of England, by Margaret his second wife, the eldest daughter of Phi∣lip king of France, surnamed the Hardy. Vincent. Catal. Norf. He was created Earle of Norfolke, and made Earle Marshall of England, by his halfe brother King Edward the second, which Earledomes Roger Bigod (the last of that surname Earle of Norfolke, and Earle Marshall) lea∣uing no issue, left to the disposition of the king his Father. This Earle died in the yeare of our redemption 1338. Here lay buried the body of Thomas Beauford (sonne of Iohn of Gaunt, begotten of the Lady Katherine Swyneford his third wife) who by King Henry the fourth was made Admirall, Tho. Beauford Duke of Ex∣ceter. then Captaine of Calis, and after∣wards Lord Chancellour of England. He was created by the said King Earle of Perch in Normandy, and Earle of Dorlet in England. And lastly in the fourth yeare of King Henry the fifth, he was created Duke of Exce∣ter, and made knight of the order of the Garter. He had the leading of the Rereward at the battell of Agincourt, and the gouernment of king Henry the sixth, appointed to that office by the foresaid Henry the fifth on his death-bed. He valiantly defended Harflew in Normandy (whereof he was gouernour) against the Frenchmen, and in a pitched field encountring the Earle of Armiguar put him to flight. He died at his House of East Green∣wich in Kent, vpon Newyeares day the fifth of Henry the sixth: for whom all England mourned, saith Milles: Mary Queene of France. The body of Mary Queene of France, widow of Lewis the twelfth: daugh er of King Henry the 7. and sister to king Henry the eight, was here in this Abbey Church entombed. After the death of Lewis (with whom she liued not long) shee married that Martiall and pompous Gentleman, Charles Brandon Duke of Suffolke. She died on Midsomer Eeue, 1533. Iohn Boon Ab∣bot of Bury. Iohn Boon, Abbot of this Monasterie, had his tombe and interrement here in this Church; who died in the beginning of February, in the ninth yeare of the raigne of king Edward the fourth, as appeares by the said kings Conged'eslire or permission royall to the Prior and Couent of this House to make choise of another Abbot, as followeth.

Gwin in the Preface to his Readings saith, That the king of England, as Soueraigne Patron of all Archbishop∣rickes, Bishoprickes, and other Ecclesiasticall Benefices, had of ancient time free appointment of all Ecclesiasticall Dignities, whensoeuer they chanced to be voide, inuesting them per Baculum et Annulum, id est, with a Staffe and a Ring, and afterward by his Letters Patents: And that in pro∣cesse of time he made the election ouer to others, vnder certaine formes and conditions: as namely, that they should at euery vacation, before they chuse, demand of the king Gonged'eslire, that is, licence and leaue to proceed to election; and then after the election, to craue his royall assent, &c. And further, he affirmeth by good proofe out of Common Law bookes, that king Iohn was the first that granted this, and that it was afterward confir∣med by Westm. pri. cap. which Statute was made Anno 3. Ed. primi. And againe by the Statute Articuli Clerica. 2. which was ordained Anno 25. Ed. 3. Statuto tertio. Sir William Elmham, Sir William Spencer, Sir William Fresill, qui ob∣ijt Anno 1357. William Lee Esquire, and his wife, daughter of Harlestone ; lay here interred. The famous Poet, and the most learned Monke of this monasterie, was here interred. I meane Iohn Lidgate, so called of a small village not farre off where he was borne. Iohn Lidgate Monke. A village (saith Camden ) though small, yet in this re∣spect, not to be passed ouer in silence, because it brought into the world, Iohn Lidgate the Monke, whose wit may seeme to haue beene framed and shapen by the very muses themselues: so brightly reshine in his English verses, all the pleasant graces and elegancie of speech, according to that age, hauing trauelled through France and Italy, to learne the languages and Arts. Erat autem non solum elegans Poeta, et Rhetor disertus, verum etiam Mathematicus expertus, Philosophus acutus, et Theologus non contemnen∣dus : For he was not onely an elegant Poet, and an eloquent Rhetorician, but also an expert Mathematician, an acute Philosopher, and no meane Diuine, saith Pitseus ; you may know further of him in his Prologue to the storie of Thebes; a Tale, as his fiction is) which (or some other) hee was constrained to tell, at the command of mine Host of the Tabard in Southwarke, whom he found in Canterbury, with the rest of the Pilgrims which went to visite Saint Thomas Shrine. This story was first written in Latine by Geffrey Chaucer, and translated by Lidgate into English verse: but of the Prologue, of his owne making, so much as concernes himselfe, thus. ....... while that the pilgrimes ley At Canterbury, well lodged one and all I know not. I not in sooth what I may it call, Hap or Fortune, in conclusioun, That me befell to enter into the toun. The holy Sainct plainely to visite, After my sicknesse, vowes to acquite. In a cope of blacke, and not of greene, On a Palfrey slender, long, and lene, With rusty bridle, made not for the sale, My man to forne with a voyd male, That by Fortune tooke mine Inne anone Where the Pilgrimes were lodged euerichone. The same time her gouernour the host Stonding in Hall, full of wind and bost, Liche to a man wonder sterne and fers, Which spake to me, and saied anon dan Pers, Dan Dominicke dan Godfray, or Clement Ye be welcome newly into Kent: Thogh your bridle haue nother boos ne bell; Beseeching you that ye will tell First of your name, and what cuntre Without more shortly that ye be, That looke so pale, all deuoid of bloud, Vpon your head a wonder thredbare hood, Well arrayed for to ride late: I answered my name was Lidgate, Monke of Bury, me fifty yeare of age, Come to this toune to do my pilgrimage As I haue Promised. hight, I haue thereof no shame: Dan Iohn (qd he) well brouke ye your name, Thogh ye be sole, beeth right glad and light, Praying you to soupe with vs this night; And ye shall haue made at your deuis, A great pudding, or a round hagis A franche A dish made of marrow and grated bread. moile, a tanse, or a A Pancake. froise, To been a Monke slender is your Couuremnet coise Ye haue beene sicke I dare mine head assure, Or let feed in a faint pasture: Lift vp your head, be glad, take no sorrow, And ye should home ride with vs to morrow I say, when ye rested haue your fill. After supper, sleepe will doen none ill, Wrap well your head, clothes round about, Strong Nappy Ale. nottie ale will make a man to rout, Take a pillow that ye lye not low, If need be, spare not to blow, To hold wind by mine opinion, Will engender colles passion, And make men to greuen on her Gu rops When they haue filled her mawes and her crops. But toward night, eat some Fennell rede, Annis, Commin, or Coriander sede, And like as I haue power and might, I charge you, rise not at midnight, Thogh it be so the Moone shine clere, I will my selfe be your Clocke: Orlogere, To morrow earely when I see my time, For we will forth parcell afore prime. Accompanie Verely. parde shall doe you good. Thus, when the Host had cheared vp Lidgate with these faire promises and wholesome admonitions for his health, hee laies his commands vpon him in these termes following. What, looke vp Monke, for by Cockes bloud Thou shalt be merry, who so that say nay, For to morrow anone as it is day, And that it ginne in the East to daw, Thou shalt be bound to a new law, At going out of Canterbury toun, And lien aside thy professioun, Thou shalt not chese, nor thy selfe withdraw, If any mirth be found in thy maw, Like the custome of this company, For none so proud that dare me deny, Knight Nor Squire. nor Knaue, Chanon, Priest, ne Nonne To tell a tale plainely as they conne, When I assigne, and see time oportune; And for that we our purpose will contune, We will homeward the same custome vse, And thou shalt not plainely thee excuse: Be now well ware, study well to night, But for all that, be thou of heart light, Thy wit shall be the sharper and the bet. But I runne too farre with these rimes, it is time to returne. Scripsit partim Anglicè partim Latinè, partim prosa partim versu libros nu∣mero plures, eruditione politissimos.

This name is much honoured by Sir William Drury Knight, Lord Pre∣sident of Munster, and Lord chiefe Iustice of all Ireland, as you may reade in the continuation of the Irish Cronicle, penned by Iohn Vowell, alias Hooker, where his valiant good seruices at Muttrell, Bulloigne, and Callais in France: at the commotion in Deuonshire, at Barwicke being Prouost Marshall, and at the besieging and taking of Edenborrough Castle, where he was generall of the Armie, are set downe at large: this man lieth buried at Dublin in Ireland.

This religious Foundation, The definition of a Chantrie and of a Guild. as it is in the Charter, was called a Chantrie, and a Guild. Cantaria est Aedes sacra: ideo instituta et dotata praedijs, vt Missa ibidem Cantaretur pro anima fundatoris, et propinquorum eius, saith Sir Hen. Spelman, Glossar. lit. C. A Chantrie is a sacred Edifice, therefore instituted and endowed with possessions, that Masse might there bee song for the soule of the Founder, and his kindred. Gilda est societas quorundam, Id. Hen. Spelman lit. G. pura charitatis, religionis, vel mercaturae gratia confaederatorum. A Gild is a societie of certaine persons confederated or liuing together, for the onely pure cause of charitie, Religion, or for the trade of Merchandise. It is a Colledge, a sodalitie, or fellowship; a brotherhood, or companie incorporate: or it is an adunation, or a commonaltie of men gathered into one combination, supporting their common charge by a mutuall consent. In the yeare and on the day of the moneth of a great part of this Towne of Bury was burnt downe to the ground.

Here sometimes stood an ancient Priory founded by Gilbert Blund, a man of great Nobilitie, and Lord of Ikesworth, whose issue male, by the right line, ended in William, that in king Henry the third his dayes, was slaine in the battell at Lewis, and left two sisters his heires, Agnes wife to William de Creketot, Cam. in Suff. and Roise wedded to Robert de Valonijs, saith Camden. This Priory was valued to be yearely worth two hundred and fourescore pounds, nine shillings fiue pence. Clare. Here stood a religious House of Augustine Friers, whose Foundation may be gathered out of certaine rythmicall lines, which not many yeares since, I copied out of an ancient Roll, as then in the custody of my deare deceased Friend, Aug. Vincent, Windsore Herald; the Rubricke, or the Title in red letters, of this Roll, is as followeth. This Dialoge betwix a seculer askyng, and a Frere answering, at the graue of Dame Iohan of Acres ; sheweth the lineall descent of the Lordis of the honoure of Clare, fro the tyme of the fundation of the Freeris in the same honoure, the yere of our Lord a M.ccxlviii. vn∣to the first of May, the yere, a M.cccclx. The Pictures of the Secular Priest and the Friere are curiously limmed vpon the Parchment. The verses are both in Latine and English, and being in both good, I thinke it good to emprint them in both languages. Questio. Quis iacet hic? Respons. Nullus. Q. Quid tunc? R. est femina. Q. Cuiu.

Amen. Ioan of Acres Countesse of Glocester and Herdord. The body of Ioan of Acres was here entombed, as you haue already read: She was the second daughter of king Edward the first, and Queene Eleanor, borne in the first yeare of her fathers raigne, at a City in the Holy Land, sometime named Ptolomais, commonly called Acon, Aker, or Acres, where her mother remained during the warres that her father had with the Saracens. She was married at eighteene yeares of age, and outliuing her first husband (nominated in the Roll) she degenerated so farre in the electi∣on of another, as that she made choise of one Raph de Monte-hermer some∣times her husbands and her seruant. She died here at her Mannour of Clare the tenth of May, in the yeare 1305. Edward Mont-hermer. Here likewise in the Austine Friars by his mother was interred the body of Edward Mont-hermer, eldest sonne of the foresaid Raph Mount-hermer (who hauing obtained the kings fauour, had the title of Earle of Glocester and Hertford) and Ioan of Acres. Hee died without issue, the time vn∣certaine. Lionell Duke of Clarence, & Elis. his wife. Lionell, or Leonell Duke of Clarence, and Earle of Vlster in Ireland, was buried in the Chancell of this Priorie Church, together with his first wife Elisabeth, daughter and heire of William de Burgh, Earle of Vlster afore∣said, as appeareth in the parchment Roll. She departed this world in the yeare 1363. And hee about fiue yeares afterwards, as I shall hereafter shew. This Lionell, surnamed of Antwerpe, the place of his birth, was the third sonne of king Edward the third; Harding c. 187. In all the world was then no Prince hym like Of hie stature, and of all semelinesse The character of Leonell Duke of Clarence. Aboue all men within his hole kyngrike By the shulders, he might be seene doutlesse; As a mayde in halle of gentilnesse, And in all places sonne to Retorike, And in the feld a Lyon marmorike. Not long after the death of his wife Elisabeth, hee was remarried vnto Violenta the sister of Iohn Galeas, Duke of Milain, with whom hee was to receiue a wondrous great Dowrie; and in that regard he made a iourney to Millain, attended with a chosen companie of the English Nobilitie, where in most royall manner he espoused the said Lady. Of which his iourney, and marriage, may it please you reade these following measures. The kyng his soonne sir Leonell create Hard. ca 186.187. Duke of Clarence, and to Melayn him sent With chiualrie of fame well ordinate, And squyers fresh, galaunt and sufficient With officers and yomen as appent. This Duke royall of Clarence excellent, At Melayne wedded was then in royall wise With that lady faire and beneuolent Full royally, as to such a Prince should suffice, And all the rule he had by councell wise, Fro mount Godard, vnto the citee of Florence And well beloued was for his sapience. In citees all he held well vnitees, Greate Iustes ay, and ioyous tournements Of Lords and knightes, Leonell in ele∣ction to be king of Italy. he made great assemblees Through all the lande, by his wise regimentes. They purposed hole by their common assentes To croune hym kyng of all great Italy, Within halfe a yere, for his good gouernaly. But Stow, Stow Annal. out of Paulus Iouius, writes more fully of this marriage. In the moneth of Aprill, saith he, Leonell Duke of Clarence, with a cho∣sen companie of the English Nobilitie went towards Millaine, there to mar∣rie with Violentis the daughter of Galeasius the second of that name, Duke of Millaine, at whose comming to Millaine, such abundance of treasure was in most bounteous manner spent, in making most sumptuous feasts, setting forth stately sights, and honouring with rare gifts aboue two hundred Englishmen, which accompanied his sonne in law, as it seemed to surpasse the greatnesse of most wealthie Princes; for in the banquet whereat Fran∣cis Petrarch was present, A most sump∣tuous feast. Costly gifts giuen. amongst the chiefest guests, there were aboue thirtie courses of seruice at the table, and betwixt euery course, as many pre∣sents of wondrous price intermixed, all which, Iohn Galeasius, chiefe of the choise youth, bringing to the table, did offer to Leonell. There were in one onely course seuenty goodly horses, adorned with silke and siluer furniture: and in the other siluer vessells, Falcons, hounds, armour for horses, costly coates of mayle, breast plates glistering of massie steele, helmets and corselets decked with costly crestes, apparell distinct with costly Iewells, souldiers girdles: and lastly, certaine gemmes, by cu∣rious Art set in gold, and of purple, and cloth of gold for mens apparell in great abundance. Fragments of a feast s fficient to serue ten thousand men And such was the sumptuousnesse of that banquet, that the meates which were brought from the table, would sufficiently haue ser∣ued ten thousand men But not long after, Leonell liuing with his new wife, whilest after the manner of his owne countrey, as forgetting or not regard∣ing his change of ayre, he addicted himselfe ouer-much to vntimely ban∣quetings, spent and consumed with a lingring sicknesse, died, at Alba Pom∣peia, called also Languvill, in the Marquisat of Mont-ferrat in Piemont, on the Vigill of Saint Luke the Euangelist, 1368. in the two and fortieth yeare of his fathers raigne. First he was buried, saith Camden in the Annalls of Ireland, in the Citie of Papie, hard by Saint Augustine the Doctor: and afterward enterred at Clare in the Couent Church of Austin Friers in Eng∣land. He had issue onely by his first wife one daughter, named Philip. Of which you may reade before in the printed copie of the parchment Roll: and in the Chronicle of Iohn Harding, as followeth. His wife was dedde, Cap. 186. and at Clare was buried, And none heire he had, but his doughter faire, Philip that hight, as Cronicles specified, Whom quene Philip cristened for his heire: Tharchbishop of Yorke for his compeire; Hir godmother also of Warwyk the countesse A Lady was of all greate worthynes. And in another place. Cap. 187. Chyldren had he noone, but Philip heire By Elizabeth his first wyfe, which the kyng Edward maryed to Edmond Mortymer, Therle of Marche, that was his warde full yyng, Who gate on hir Roger their derelynge. Catal. of Ho∣nour. Philip, the onely daughter of Leonel Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence, saith Milles (agreeing with the former, yet going a little further) was mar∣ried vnto Edmund Mortimer, Earle of March; vpon whom the said Ed∣mund begot Roger ; and Roger, Anne: who being married vnto Richard Earle of Cambridge, thereby transported the right of the kingdome vnto the House of Yorke. I finde in my notes of Burialls in Monasteries, that these persons follow∣ing were also interred in this Priory Church. Richard, Earl of Clare, whom some will haue to bee Founder: Dame Alice Spencer : Sir Iohn Beauchamp knight: Iohn Newborne Esquire: who, amongst others, brought the body of the foresaid Leonell, Duke of Cla∣rence, into England▪ Iohn Wiborough: William Golderich▪ William Capell: and Eleanor his wife. The Lady Margaret Scroope, daughter of .... West∣merland. Iohn Kempe Esquire. Robert Butterwyke Esquire. Ione Candishe, daughter of Clopton, Dame Eleanor Wynkepery. Stoke Clare. The foundati∣on of Stoke Colledge. Here at Stoke, adioyning to Clare, was a Colledge founded by one of the Mortimers, Earle of March, valued in the kings bookes to bee yearely worth three hundred twenty foure pounds, foure shillings, penny, halfe penny. Sir Edmund Mortimer Earle of March. In this Colledge was entombed the body of Sir Edmund Mortimer the last Earle of March and Vlster of that house, Lord of Wigmore, Trim, Clare, and Conaught; the Grandchilde of that Edmund Earle of March, who married the daughter and onely heire of Leonell, Duke of Clarence, as it is in the Roll. Camd. in Rad∣norshire. This Edmund, saith Camden, in regard of his royall bloud, and right to the Crowne, stood greatly suspected to Henry the fourth, who had vsurped the kingdome; and by him was first exposed vnto dangers, in so much as he was taken (in a battell fought at Pelale in Wales) by Owen Glendowr a Rebell, and afterward whereas the Percies purposed to aduance his right, he was conueyed into Ireland, kept almost twenty yeares prisoner in the Castle of Trim, suffering all miseries incident to Princes of the bloud while they lye open to euery suspicion; and there through extreame griefe ended his dayes, the nineteenth day of Ianuary, 1424. in the third yeare of the raigne of Henry the sixth. Of the foresaid battell, his taking and miserable imprisonment, thus much out of Harding, as followeth. Syr Edmonde then Mortimer warred sore Hard. cap. 201. Vpon Owen, and did hym mekyll tene, But at laste, Owen laye hym before, Where in batell they faught, as well was sene, Where Owen toke hym prisoner, as then full kene, With mekell folke on eyther syde slayne. And set Edmonde in prysone and great payne. He wrote vnto the kyng for great socoure, For he had made with Owen his fynaunce, To whom the kyng wold graunt then no fauoure Ne nought he wold then make him cheuesaunce For to comforte his foes disobeysaunce, Wherfore he laye in fetters and sore prisone For none payment of his great raunsone. Here also lay buried the bodies of Sir Thomas Grey knight, and his first wife. Luce the wife of Walter Clopton : Sir Thomas Clopton, and Ade his wife. Sudbury. Saint Gregories. In this Church I saw a marble stone, Simon Archbi∣shop of Can∣terbury. some foure yards long, and two broad, sometimes inlayd all ouer with brasse; vnder which, the Inhabitants say, that Simon Theobold, alias Sudbury, lyeth interred; which may bee true, for howsoeuer he hath his Tombe in the Cathedrall Church at Can∣terbury, of which he was Archbishop (as I haue written before) yet that may be, perhaps, onely his Cenotaph or honorarie funerall Monument. This Simon built, whilest hee was Bishop of London, the Chappell or vpper end of the Church, where this spatious Grauestone lies couched. As appeares by this Inscription in the glasse window. Orate pro Domino Symone Thepold, The foundatiō of All Soules Chappell. alias Sudbury, qui istam Capellam fundauit, Anno Domini M.cccclxv. in commemoracione omnium animarum dedicat, dat, consecrat.

Thus writes Godwin in the life of this Archbishop. And I finde in the Catalogue of Religious Houses, collected by Speed, that this Simon, together with one Iohn Chart∣sey, founded also the Priory of Augustine Friers in this Towne; The foundati∣on of the Friers. howsoeuer I haue a Manuscript tells me, that one Baldwin de Shipling, or Simperling, and Chabill his wife, were the sole Founders who lie buried in the Chan∣cell of the Priory Church. Besides in the said Church lie buried (as I haue it in the notes of burials, from William le Neue, Yorke Heraldy the bodies of Robert, the sonne of Sir William Simperling knight.

The educati∣on of Arch¦bishop Simon. But to returne backe againe to the supposed Founder of this Monasterie, Simon, Archbishop as aforesaid; who from his childhood was euer brought vp at the Schoole, and being yet very yong, was sent by his father beyond the Seas to study the Canon Law, His prefer∣ments. and hauing proceeded Doctor of that faculty, became houshold Chaplaine to Pope Innocent the sixt, and one of the Iudges or Auditors of his Rota. The said Pope by way of prouision, thrust him into the Chancellorship of Salisbury, and then afterward, into the Bishopricke of London. Ex Arch. Turris Lond.

Mss In bib. Cot. Quatuor in mortem spirarunt federa Thome, Symonis et centum mille dedere necem. De vita Thome Rex motus corde dolebat, Symonis extremum Rex dolet atque diem.

And so he goes on, exclaiming against the sauage barbarousnesse of the Rebels, and this their execrable horrid act. Sir Robert Hales, Sir Robert Hales. Lord Prior of Saint Iohns Ierusalem, neere Clerken∣well, and a great many of others, that day tasted of the same cup and the Arch∣bishop had done. The chiefe leaders of this damned crew, were Wat Tyler of Maidstone in Kent, whom Wals. cals the Idoll of Clownes; Iohn Wraw, a Priest, Iack Straw, Iohn Littistar a Dier in Norwich, who tooke vpon him at Norwalsham in Norfolke, the name of the King of the Commons, Ro∣bert Westborne, who did the like in Suffolke, &c. and these had a Chaplaine as gracelesse as themselues, one Iohn Ball, an excommunicated Priest, who with his wicked doctrine nourished in them their seditious furies. This rebellious insurrection is exactly, and to the life exprest, by my fore∣named Author Io. Gower, in the foresaid booke, the eleuenth chapter, where in a vision he faignes to haue seene and heard certaine spirits of their Pseu¦do Prophet Ball (personating hereby these and all other Rebels) calling one vpon another to rise vp in commotion, as followeth. The readie pronenesse of the common people to re∣bellion. Watte vocat, cui Thome venit, neque Symme retardat, Betteque Gibbe simul Hykke venire iubent.

But I haue bin too long detained by these Rebels, whose infernall at∣tempts had condigne punishment by so little of so much, which here is written, we may cleerely behold the hideous face of Anarchie, or gouern∣ment without Prince or ruler, as also the distorted visage of Plebeian fury.

The said Sir William Waldegraue died at Callys in France, where his body is buried in Saint Maries Church there. Here lye buried, (as I haue it by relation) Sir Thomas Eden Knight, and Thomas Eden, Clerke of the starre Chamber, both vnder one monument. I read, Stow Annal. Hollins. that Alexander Eden, Esquire, Sheriffe of Kent, tooke Iacke Cade, Captaine of the Rebels, in the 29. of Henry the Sixt, prisoner, for which, and for other his good seruices against the said Rebels, he was made Custos or keeper of the Castle at Rochester.

Here sometime stood a Priory of blacke Canons Augustines, founded by Raph de Glanvile, dedicated to the blessed Virgine Mary. Valued in the Kings bookes at three hundred eighteene pounds seuenteene shillings two pence halfe penny farthing, and surrendred the first of March, in the nine and twentieth yeare of the raigne of king Henry the eight. Mic. de la Pole E. of Suffolke. In this Priory Church was interred the body of Michael de la Pole, the third of that name, Lord Wingfield, and Earle of Suffolke. Who was slaine at the battell of Agincourt, with Edward Plantagenet, Duke of Yorke. On our side, was the duke of Yorke ther slain, Therle also of Suffolke worshipfully. This battell was strucken on the 25. day of October, Ann. 1415. Hadley. Gurmond king of Denmarke. Here in this Church, as the Inhabitants say, Gurmond, or Gurthrun, a Danish King lieth interred: and this their assertion is confirmed by the most of our ancient Historians; yet the Tombe which they shew for his funerall Monument beares not that face of Antiquitie, as to be of seuen hun∣dred yeares and more continuance; if any Monument remaine here to his memory, in my vnderstanding, it is one of these in the North or South wall. This Pagan king of Denmarke, after he had for many yeares infest∣ed and harried this kingdome, and driuen Alfred our king to strange ex∣tremities; was in the end ouercome by Alfred in battell: presently vpon which he was washed in the lauer of Baptisme; Gurmound christened. (which was one of the con∣ditions of peace at his ouerthrow) Alfred receiued him for his godsonne by the name of Athelstane, and gaue him in free gift this countrey of East Angels; and in the same fountaine of Grace (saith Simon of Durham) thirtie of the chiefe Danish Nobilitie were initiated, vpon whom the true Christian King bestowed many rich gifts.

After he had gouerned these counties of Suffolke and Norfolke (keeping his residence here in this Towne) the space of twelue yeares complete, he died and was buried in the kings towne, called Headlega (so Hadley is called in the Saxons language) in Suffolke among the East English, in the yeare 889. Ipswich in times past Gipswich. Had Ipswich (the onely eye of this Shire) beene as fortunate in her sur∣name, as she is blessed with commerce and buildings, shee might well haue borne the title of a Citie; neither ranked in the lowest row: whose trade, circuit, and seate, doth equall most places of the land besides. It is adorned with twelue or fourteene Churches; in all which, I finde not any funerall Monument of Antiquitie, saue one which came to light not long since vpon the remouall of a Pewe in Saint Laurence Church (and so like wise in other Churches many Monuments are buried) vnder which the Founder of the said Church was interred, as appeares by this Epitaph en∣grauen vpon the Stone.

The roofe whereof, and other parts of the Quire, be∣ing curiously engrauen with sundry kindes of workes and pictures, all bur∣nisht and gilt with gold. The Organ case, whereupon these words, Soli Deo Honor & Gloria, are carued, and gilt ouer; is garnished and adorned in most costly manner. The Font, and the Couer of the same, is without com∣pare, being of a great height, cut and gloriously depicted with many Ima∣geries consonant to the representation of the holy Sacrament of Baptisme, as also with the Armes of the Vffords, Earles of Suffolke, whose principall habitation was in this Towne. It is said by the Inhabitants, the foresaid Earles of Suffolke, lie here interred, but I finde no shew of it in the Church; as also the bowels of Raph de Vfford, Raph de Vfford Lord chiefe ustice o Ireland. Lord chiefe Iustice of Ireland: of whom the Annales of Ireland speake thus as followeth. Vpon the 13. day of Iuly, 1343, the Lord Ralph Vfford, with his wife, the Countesse of Vlster, came Lord chiefe Iustice of Ireland: vpon whose entring, the faire weather changed sodainly into a distemperature of the aire, . Annal Hi era. and from that time there ensued great store of raine, with much abundance of tempestuous stormes, vntill his dying day. None of this Predecessors in the times past was, (with griefe be it spoken) comparable vnto him. A wicked chiefe Iustice. For, this Iusticer bearing the Office of Iusticeship, became an oppressor of the people of Ireland, a robber of the goods both of the Clergie and Laitie, of rich and poore alike: a defrauder of many vnder the colour of doing good: not obseruing the rights of the Church, nor keeping the law of the Kingdome: offering wrongs to the na∣turall inhabitants: ministring iustice to few or none, and altogether distru∣sting (some few onely excepted) the inborne dwellers in the land. These things did he still, and attempted the like, misled by the counsell and per∣swasion of his wife. Thus he continued his rigorous gouernement for the space almost of three yeares: and vpon Palme sunday, 1346. which fell out to be the ninth day of Aprill, went the way of all flesh. For whose departure, his owne de∣pendants, together with his wife, sorrowed not a little: for whose death also the loyall subiects of Ireland reioyce no lesse: the Clergy and people both of the Land, Ioy vpon the death of the Iustice. for ioy of his departure out of this life, with merry hearts doe leape, and celebrate a solemne feast at Easter. At whose death, the flouds ceased, and the distemperature of the aire had an end, and in one word, the common sort truely and heartily praise the onely sonne of God. Well, when this Iustice, (now dead) was once fast folded within a sheet and Coffin of lead, the foresaid Countesse (with his treasure not worthy to be bestowed among such holy reliques) in horrible griefe of heart, conueied him ouer into England, there to be enterred. Orate pro... Roberti Lambe, & Alicie Lambe...... Rob. Lambe and Alice his wife. ..... Lambe...... ... Lambe. These Lambes haue beene speciall benefactors to this Church, being sometimes men of faire possessions in this parish, as I was told; their names with the pictures of Lambes are depensild in many places of the wood∣worke and feeling of the Church.

These Nunnes were of the order of S. Clare, and called Minoresses. Maud, The foundati∣on of a Chan∣trie in the Pri∣ory Church at Campsey. who was first married to William Lord Burgh, Earle of Vlster, and after, to Raph de Vfford, chiefe Iustice of Ireland, repenting her selfe (be∣like) of her own and her last husbands delinquences committed in Ireland, of which I haue spoken before, obtained licence of King Edward the third, by the procuration of her brother Henry, Earle of Lancaster, to found a Chantrie in this monastery, of fiue Chaplaines, secular Priests, to pray and sing Masse for the soules of the said William de Burgh, and Raph de Vfford, whose body was here interred: such is the Charter of the Foun∣dation.

On a time a Gentleman of Northampton being at the signe of the Growne in Sudbury, The Antiquity of the Wald∣g aues. and hauing conference with master Edward Wald∣graue of Bilston, in Com. Suss. Esquire, did make vnto him a very credible report of one Waldegraue in Northamptonshire, affirming that he heard it reported of old time, that these Waldgraues were of a very ancient anti∣quitie before William the Conquerours raigne, and that his name should be Iohn : who hauing one onely daughter, and meeting with one Wald∣graue which came out of Germany, and was employed in the Conquerors seruices, the said Germane Waldgraue related with Waldgraue of North∣amptonshire, concerning the marriage of his said daughter; & told him that if he would giue his consent that he might haue his daughter in marriage, that then he would procure him a pardon from the Conquerour, for the quiet enioying of his lands and liuings. By which meanes he obtained the Conquerours grant, with his owne hand and Seale, for confirmation of all his lands vnto him and his posterity. The which Pardon and grant remay∣neth to be seene at this day, 1612. in the French tongue, and is in the pos∣session of the Lords of that Mannour. Iohn Rauen Richmond Herald. Thebarton. Sir Will.

After all these honours giuen him, he was banished England for fiue yeares, for being too familiar with Queene Margaret, priuy and consenting to the yeelding and losse of Aniou and Mayne (as also to appease the murmuring of the people for the murthering of the Duke of Glocester) and as he was aking of ship to passe for France, he was surprised and taken on the sea, by a ship of warre, called the Nicholas, belonging to the Duke of Exceter, then Constable of the Tower of London, and there presently beheaded, and his body cast into the sea, which was after found, and taken vp againe at Douer, brought to this Colledge, and here honourably interred, saith Hall, as also the Catalogue of Honour by Brooke.

Blithborrow. nna, King of the East An∣gles, and Fer∣minus his son. This little Towne is memorable, for that Anna, King of the East An∣gles, together with his eldest sonne and heire apparent Ferminus, were here buried, both slaine in a bloudie fierce battaile, by Penda the Mercian King, a Pagan: of which my old Manuscript. Penda anone his hoste withe hym he led; And on Anna came fyrst with mykle pryde Kynge of Este Englonde, Egfrid, King of . whos dowter Egfryde wed And slew him. Anna was a man of great vertue, Lib. Hist. 3. cap. 18. and the father of a blessed issue, saith Bede, which were many, and those of great holinesse and sanctitie of life. First, Ferminus, slaine in the same battaile with his father, as I haue said be∣fore; here buried, but afterwards remoued to S. Edmundsbury. His other sonne was Erkenwald, Anna his issue. Abbot of Chertseie, and Bishop of London, of whom before. His daughters were these. Etheldred, Etheldred, Ab∣besse of ly. the eldest, was first married vnto a Noble man, whom Bede nameth Tombert Gouernour of the Fenny Countries of Norfolke, Huntington, Lincolne, and Cambridge shires. And after his death, remaining a virgin, she was married to Egfrid, King of Northumberland, with whom likewise she liued in perfect virgi∣nitie, the space of twelue yeares, notwithstanding his entreaty and allure∣ments to the contrary. From whom lastly she was released, and had licence to depart his Court, vnto the Abbey of Coldingham, where first shee was vailed a Nunne vnder Abbesse Ebba, and thence departing, she liued at Ely, and became her selfe Abbesse thereof; wherein lastly she died, and was in∣terred; remembred vnto posterities by the name of S. Audrie, of whom, more hereafter. His second daughter was Sexburgh, S burgh Ab¦besse f ly. who married Ercombert, King of Kent, vnto whom she bare two sons, and two daughters; after whose death, she tooke the habit of a Nunne, and succeeded her Sister Etheldrid, Abbesse of Ely, Whitgith a Mench on. wherein she died, and was interred. And their yongest sis∣ter Withgith, was likewise a Menchion with them in the same monastery, and all of them canonized for Saints. Ethilburghe, Ethilburge Abbesse of Be king. Bed . his third daughter, was made Abbesse of Berking in Essex, built by her brother Bishop Erkinwald, wherein she liued, and lastly died, as I haue said before. A naturall daughter likewise he had, whose name was Edelburgh, Edelburge, Ab∣besse B igges in France. Bede. that with Sedrido, the daughter of his wife, were both of them professed Nuns, and succeeded each other Abbesses in the Monastery of S. Brigges in France. Such a reputed holinesse was it held in those daies, not onely to be separated from the accompanying with men, Speed cap. 11. but also to abandon the coun∣trie of their natiuity, and as strangers in forraine lands, to spend the conti∣nuance of their liues.

On the North side of the Isle neare vnto the former monument standeth a marble Tombe, vpon which lie the pourtraitures of Sir Thomas Corn∣walleis knight, in Armour, and Anne his wife..... Of these two, and of the familie of Cornwalleis, thus Camden writes, Camd. in Su . concurring with the words in these Inscriptions. At Brome, saith he, dwelt a long time the Familie of Cornwalleis, of knights degree: of whom Sir Iohn Cornwalleis was Steward of Edward the sixth his houshold, while he was Prince: and his sonne Sir Thomas, for his wisedome and faithfulnesse became one of the priuie Councell to Queene Mary, and Controllour of her royall House.

Or Felixton (so named of Felix, the first Bishop of these parts, like as many other places in this Shire) had in times past a Monastery of Nunnes, of whose Foundation I haue read in a namelesse Manuscript, as followeth. The founda∣tion of Flixton Nunnery. Margery de Creke daughter to Galfride Hanes, the widow of Bartholo∣mew Creke, gaue her whole Mannour of Flixton, with all the appurtenan∣ces, which came to her by Inheritance, to haue a Religious house of Nuns erected, which should professe the Rule of Saint Austin. Simon de Wanton at that time Bishop of Norwich, Sir William Blunde, Robert de Valines, William de Medef nd, being witnesses of her donation and gift: which was in the raigne of King Henry the third; for I finde that in his time these wit∣nesses did flourish. It was valued at the generall ouerthrow of such houses, at twenty three pounds foure shillings, pennie, halfe penny qua. Walton or Waletune. The Priory of Walton. A Priory dedicated to Saint Felix the Bishop before remembred; where∣in were placed blacke Monkes Benedictines. And this is all I finde of this Foundation, saue that the Bigots or Bigods Earles of Norfolke, were great benefactours to this religious building; if not the sole Founders of the same. As will appeare by this peece of a Record following. E Arch. Turris Lon . Cart. an∣tiq. li .

Cuius anime propitietur Deus. Amen. Cnobersburg or Burgh Castell. Which as Camden saith out of venerable Bede, was a most pleasant Ca∣stle, by reason of the woods and sea together, wherein a Monastery was built by Furseus a holy Scot; Sigebert king of the East-Angles a Monke. His death. by whose perswasions Sigebert king of the East Angles became a Monke, and resigned vp his kingdome: who after∣wards being drawne against his will out of this Monastery, to encourage his people in battell against the Mercians, together with his company, lost his life. In that place now there are onely ruinous walls, in forme as it were foure square, built of flint stone and British bricke. But the story of the Foundation of this Abbey will best appeare in the life of Furseus, written by Bede, and followed by Capgraue. Bede lib 3. cap. 19. Capgraue lit. F. fo∣lio 153 as followeth. In the time that Sigebert yet gouerned the East parts of England, a holy man, The f unda on of the M ∣nasterie of . called Furseus, came thither out of Ireland, a man notable both for his sayings and doings, of great vertue, and much desiring to wander and trauell in Gods quarrell, wheresoever occasion serued. Comming there∣fore to the east coasts of England, hee was reuerently receiued of the said King, where pursuing his godly desire of Preaching the word of God, hee both conuerted many Infidels, and confirmed the faithfull in the faith and loue of Christ, by his painefull Preaching, and vertuous examples. Where falling into sicknesses, hee had from God a vision by the ministery of An∣gels, wherein he was warned to goe forward cheerefully in his painefull Preaching of the Gospell, and to perseuere in his accustomed watching and praying, because his end and death was certaine, though the houre thereof was most vncertaine, according to the saying of our Lord. Watch therefore, ye know not the day nor the houre. With this vision being much confirmed and encouraged, he hastened with all speed to build vp the Mo∣nasterie in the place king Sigebert had giuen vnto him, and to instruct it with regular discipline. This Monastery was pleasantly situated for the Woods and Sea adioyning, being erected in the village of Gnobersburg, and enriched afterwards by Anna, King of that prouince, and many other Noble men, with sundry faire houses, and other ornaments. This Mona∣stery was founded about the yeare of our Lord, 636. and demolished long before the violent deluge of such buildings, which happened in the raigne of King Henry the eight. Gorlston. Gorl oe Fri∣ Here I saw, saith Camden, the tower steeple of a small suppressed Friery, which standeth the Sailers in good steed for a marke: of which Friery I neuer marked further. Lestoffe. Tho Scroop , a Bishop in Ireland. Here lieth buried the body of Thomas Scroope, otherwise sirnamed Brad∣ley, of the towne wherein he was borne, descended of the noble family of the Scroopes, Qui claritatem generis literis et virtutibus plurimum illustra∣bat : who very much adorned the honour of his birth, by his learning and vertues. He was first a Monke ordinis Sancti Benedicti, of the order of Saint Benet : after that, ad maiorem aspirans perfectionem, aspiring to a greater perfection of life, hee tooke vpon him the profession and rule of a Dominican, and after that, he submitted himselfe to the discipline of the Carmelites, (of whose Institution he writ a learned Treatise) and preached the Gospell in haire and sackcloth round about the Countrie. Then hee withdrew himselfe againe to his house of Carmelites in Norwich, and there remained twenty yeares, leading the life of an Anchorite, but yet af∣ter that time, he came abroad, and was aduanced by the Pope to a Bishop∣ricke in Ireland, called Dromorensis Episcopatus, the said Pope (which was Eugenius the fourth) sent him in embassage to the Ile of Rhodes (of which he writ a booke) from whence being returned, he left Ireland and his Bi∣shopricke, came into the East countries, wherein hee went vp and downe barefooted, teaching in townes abroad, the ten commandements, and preaching the glad tidings of the Gospell. Quicquid autem vel ex suis redi∣tibus percepit, vel alias a ditioribus lucrari poterat, id totum aut pauperibus distribuit aut in alios pios vsus erogauit: whatsoeuer hee tooke, either of his owne yearely profits, or what he could procure from the richer sort of people; he distributed it all to the poore, or employed it to pious vses. At the length, Anno aetatis suae plus minus centesimo in Leistoft Suffolciencis comitatus oppido viuendi finem fecit, in the yeare of his age, one hundred or thereabouts: he died in this towne of Lestoffe, the fifteenth day of Ianu∣ary, in the yeare of our Lord, 1491. the seuenth of Henry the seuenth. Here he was buried, cum Epitaphio Elegiaco, with an Elegiacall or sorrowfull Epitaph, engrauen vpon his monument: two of the last verses of which, are these two verses following. Venit ad occasum morbo confectus amoro; Spiritus alta petit, pondere corpus humum. If you would know more of this learned Irish Bishop, reade Bale and Pit∣seus in his life. Somerley. The habitation in ancient times of Fitz-Osbert, from whom it is come lineally to the worshipfull ancient Familie of the Iernegans, Knights of high esteeme in these parts, saith Camden in this tract. Vpon an ancient Knight (saith the same Author in his Remaines) Sir Iernegan, buried crosse legd at Somerley in Suffolke, some hundred yeares since is written. Iesus Christ, both God and man, Saue thy seruant Iernegan. Sir Iernegon or Ierningham. This Knight, as I gather by computation of yeares, was Sir Richard Ier∣ningham or Iernegan, who for his staid wisedome, was chosen to be one of the priuie Chamber to King Henry the eight, vpon this occasion follow∣ing. Certaine Gentlemen of the priuy Chamber, Stow Annal. An. reg. Hen. 8.10. which through the Kings lenitie, in bearing with their lewdnesse, forgetting themselues, and their duty towards his grace, in being too familiar with him, not hauing due re∣spect to his estate and degree, were remoued, by order taken from the Councell, vnto whom the King had giuen authoritie to vse their discreti∣ons in that behalfe, and then were foure sad and ancient Knights put into the Kings priuy Chamber, Ric. Wingfield. Ric. Ierningham Ric. Weston. Will. Kingstone, Knights. whose names were Sir Richard Wingfield, Sir Richard Ierningham, Sir Richard Weston, and Sir William Kingstone. Or it may be, Sir Robert Ierningham, knighted by the Duke of Suffolke, Charles Brandon, at the battaile, and yeelding vp of Mont de dier, a towne in France. But which of the Family soeuer he was, the name hath beene of exem∣plarie note before the Conquest; if you will beleeue thus much as follow∣eth, taken out of the Pedegree of the Ierninghams, by a iudicious gentle∣man. Anno M.xxx. Canute, King of Denmarke, and of England after his re∣turne from Rome, brought diuers Captaines and Souldiers from Den∣marke, whereof the greatest part were christened here in England, Ierningham. and be∣gan to settle themselues here, of whom, Iernegan, or Iernengham, and Ien∣nihingho, now Iennings, Iennings. were of the most esteeme with Canute, who gaue vnto the said Ierningham, certaine royalties, and at a Parliament held at Oxford, the said King Canute did giue vnto the said Ierningham, certaine Mannors in Norfolke, and to Iennings, certain Mannors lying vpon the sea¦side neere Horwich in Suffolke, in regard of their former seruices done to his Father Swenus King of Denmarke. Snape. The founda∣tion of Snape P ry. A Priory of blacke Monkes, and a Cell to Colchester, founded in the yeare, 1099. the twelfth of William Rufus, by William Martill, and Albre∣da his wife, and Geffrey Martill their sonne and heire, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and valued in the Kings bookes to be yearely worth, ninety nine pounds, one shilling, eleuen pence halfe penny. Hoxon. The of H on. In times past called Hegilsdon, and much ennobled by reason of the Martyrdome in this place of Edmund, King of the East Angles, enshrined sometimes in the Abbey of Bury, as I haue spoken before, honoured by his name, to whose holinesse, a Monasterie was erected in this place. Wykes. This was a Monastery of Nuns, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, founded by King Henry the third, The foundati∣on of Wykes Monastery. or at least wise by him confirmed, as it is in the Records in the Tower: valued at fourescore and twelue pounds, twelue shillings, three pence halfe penny of yearely commings in. Neyland. The manufacture of Clothing in this County, hath bin much greater, and those of that trade farre richer, I perswade my selfe, heretofore then in these times, or else, the heires and executors of the deceased, were more carefull that the Testators dead corps should bee interred in more decent manner, then they are now a daies; otherwise I should not finde so many marbles richly inlaid with brasse, to the memory of Clothiers in foregoing ages, and not one in these latter seasons. All the monuments in this Church which beare any face of comelinesse or antiquity, are erected to the memo∣rie of Clothiers, and such as belong to the mystery.

In the South part of the said Church betweene the high Altar and the Quier is a monument (with this similitude and subscription, aforemen∣tioned) of the right honourable Lady Katherine, daughter of William Lord Molins, the first wife of Iohn Howard Duke of Norfolke, who was the sonne of Sir Robert Howard, and of Margaret his wife, daughter and co-heire of Tho.

At the vpper end in the North side of this Church, next to the Chan∣cell, Iohn de Peyton, Iohn Peyton. the sonne of Reginald, lieth interred vnder a marble stone. About the verge whereof these few French words following are one∣ly remayning. .... Iena de Peytona .... Mercye ... lame Crist.... Sir Io. Peyton Knight.

Le cours de oi ici gist; L'ame receyue Ihu crist. Amen. Camd. in Cam∣bridgeshire. These Peytons had their mansion at Peyton Hall in Boxford not farre hence. Of which and of them Camden. Wicken came to the familie of the Peytons, saith he, by a daughter and coheire of the Gernons about Ed∣ward the thirds time, as afterward Isleham descended to them by a coheire of Bernard in Henry the sixth his time: which knightly familie of Peytons flowred out of the same male-stocke, whence the Vffords Earles of Suffolke descended, as appeareth by their coat-armour, albeit they assumed the surname of Peyton, according to the vse of that age, from their Mannour of Peyton Hall in Boxford in the County of Suffolke. Dodnash. The founda∣tion of the Monastery of Dodnath. A Monastery dedicated to the honour of our alone Sauiour Christ, and the blessed Virgine his mother; founded by some of the Ancestours of the Earles or Dukes of Norfolke.

William Cheney, or William de Casineto, who held the Baronie of Hors∣ford in the County of Norfolke, erected an Abbey here at Sibton, which he dedicated to the Virgine Mary, and therein placed blacke Monkes Ci∣stertians; which was valued at the suppression to bee yearely worth two hundred fifty pounds, fifteene shillings, seuen pence, halfe pennie. Redlingfield. The Founda∣tion of the Priory of Re∣lingfield. In this Parish was a religious House of blacke Nunnes, dedicated like∣wise to the Virgine Mary, and founded by one Manasses de Guies. Valued at fourescore and one pound two shillings, fiue pence halfe pennie. Rendlesham. Howsoeuer there be no Inscriptions here vpon any of the Grauestones in the Church, Rendlesham a Towne of great note in former times. yet questionlesse in former times it hath beene beautified with the Funerall Monuments of many worthie Personages. For, here Red∣wald king of the East Angles kept vsually his Court, who was the first of all his Nation that was baptised, and receiued Christianity: but afterwards se¦duced by his wife, Beda li. 2. ca. 25. he had in the selfe same Church, as saith Bede, one Altar for Chirsts Religion, Camd. in Suff and another for sacrifices vnto Deuills. In this place also Swidelm a king of these East-Angles was likewise afterwards baptised by Cedda Bishop of London. Redwald hauing raigned king of the East-Angles one and thirty yeares, Speed ca 19. Redwald, Swi∣d lm, kings of the East An∣gles. and Monarch of the Englishmen eight yeares, died in the yeare of our sal∣uation six hundred twenty three. And (by supposition) he as also Swid lme lye buried at this place. Ratisford. An Hospitall dedicated to Saint Iohn, Ratisford Hospitall. valued at thirty three pounds ten shillings. Of which I haue read no further. Rombuth, or Rombrughe. A Priory of blacke Monkes dedicated to Saint Michaell. Rombrughe. Saint Genouefa Fernham. This village is in this regard memorable, Camd. in Iohn Textor. for that Richard Lucy Lord chiefe Iustice of England, and Protectour of the kingdome in the absence of king Henry the second, tooke prisoner here in a pight field, Robert sur∣named Blanchmame, Earle of Leicester, together with his Amazonian proud Countesse, Burialls at Fernham. Petronell, or Pernell ; and withall put to the sword aboue ten thousand Flemmings, which the said Robert had leuied and sent forth to the depopulation of his countrey: all, or the most, of which number, were buried in and about this the foresaid village of Fernham, in the yeare of our redemption, 1173. in the twentith of Henry the second. Of the valourous atcheeuements and pious actions of this worthie Knight, and religious Votarie, I haue related somewhat before within the Diocesse of Rochester, where I write of the dissolued monastery of Lesnes, an Abbey of his Foundation, where in the place where the Church there∣of sometime stood (which had laine a long time buried in her owne ruines, and growne ouer with Oke, Elme, and Ashe-trees) certaine workemen ap∣pointed, by the owner of the mannour, Sir Iohn Epsley knight, to digge amongst the rubbish of the decayed Fabricke for stones, happened vpon a goodly Funerall monument, Sir Rich. Lucie found buried in the Abbey of Lesnes. Ann. 1030. the full proportion of a man, in his coate ar∣mour cut all in freestone; his sword hanging at his side by a broad belt, vpon which the Flower de luce was engrauen in many places (being as I take it the Rebus or name-deuise of the Lucies ) this his representation or picture lay vpon a flat marble stone; that stone vpon a trough or coffin of white smooth hewen Ashele stone, in that coffin, and in a sheet of lead, both being made fit for the dimension of a dead body;) the remaines of an h e drie carkasse, lay enwrapped, whole and vndisioynted, and vpon the head, some haire, or a simile quiddam of haire appeared: they found like∣wise other statues of men, in like manner proportioned, as also of a woman in her attire and abiliments, with many grauestones and bones of the de∣ceased; to see all which, great confluence of people resorted, amongst which number, I was not the hindmost.

Norfolke. B Isus the fourth Bishop of the East-Angles, The diuision of the Diocesse of the East-Angles. waxing old and sickly, diuided his Diocesse into two parts; whereof the one hee appointed to bee the Iurisdiction of a Bishop that should haue his See at North Elmham in Norfolke: in the other at Dunwich aforesaid he continued himselfe, as also did others of his Successours, to the number of eleuen. Elmham pagus obscurus et ignobilis: Elmham the Bishops eate. Baldwin the first Bishop. an obscure little village, and of no estimation, saith Harpsfield, Saecul. 8. cap. 9. was thus honoured and en∣riched with the residence of many reuerend holy Bishops, successiuely from Baldwin who was the first, vntill by reason of the great troubles of those times in the Danish warres, this See, as also the other at Dunwich, stood voide almost an hundred yeares, vntill King Edwy, the twentie ninth Mo∣narch of the Englishmen, about the yeare 955. preferred one Athulfe to this Bishopricke of the East Angles, who gouerned the whole Diocesse alone, and constantly kept his abode here at Elmham aforesaid; after whom succeeded Alfrid, Godwin. Catal. Theodred, and Theodred, Athelstan, Algar, Alwyn, Al∣fricke, and Alfrey, after him Stigand, who enioying the place but a short time, was depriued; the like happened to Grinketell his successour, who be∣ing conuicted to haue vsed vnlawfull meanes in obtaining this Dignitie, was likewise depriued, and Stigand restored to it againe. From whence he was aduanced to the See of Winchester, and after to the Archbishopricke of Canterbury; and being so preferred, hee found the meanes to procure this Bishopricke of the East-Angles, vnto Egelmare his brother. All these Bishops vntill the time of William the Conquerour, had their Sees here at Elmham. The said Conquerour substituted his Chaplaine Arfastus in the place of Egelmare, The ford the Bishops seate. Arfastus the first Bishop. by whose aduice the See was translated from Elmham to Thet∣ford, a man very vnlearned, and of no extraordinary parts at all: being Chaplaine to the Conquerour, who was then but Duke of Normandy, he would needs make a iourney to Becco in Normandy, where Lanfranke (af∣terwards Archbishop of Canterbury) was then Abbot, as also where Ar∣fastus had beene a Monke, and well esteemed of for his learning, because that before Lanfranks comming, he was Luscus inter Strabones amongst a number of drones meerely vnlearned, Godwin out of Ma msbury. onely a little smattering of learning he had, with which he made a faire shew. But now by this time, by Lan∣franks meanes, the monastery of Becco was become euen a very Vniuersity, flourishing with all knowledge of good letters. Hither Arfastus coming, after a pompous and bragging manner, atten∣ded with a great troupe: Lanfranke, who by and by at the first blush espied Arfastus his ignorance, caused an Abcee to be laid before him, ferociam ho∣minis Italica facetia illudens, mocking the pride of the man with an Italian wittie ieast: which ieast or ieering scoffe, Arfastus so tooke to heart, as hee neuer lynne till he had caused the Duke to banish Lanfranke out of Nor∣mandy. Howbeit when Lanfranke came to take his leaue of the Duke, hapning to ride on a lame iade, the Duke fell into such a laughter, at the halting of his horse, as in that merry mood, by meanes of some friends, hee was quickly reconciled to him againe. This Bishop died about the begin∣ning of the raigne of King William Rufus. William, the st Bishop of Thetford, and the first of Norwich. Vpon the death of Arfastus, one William Herbert, sirnamed Galfagus, for the summe of a thousand and nine hundred pounds, obtained of the said King William Rufus, this Bishopricke for himselfe, and the Abbacy of Winchester for his father: for satisfaction of which Simony, this penance was enioyned him by Pope Paschalis the second, that he should build cer∣taine Churches and Monasteries, which hee religiously performed. This Towne of Thetford hauing bin first sacked by Suenus the Dane, who in a rage set it on fire, in the yeare 1004. and sixe yeares after, spoiled againe by the furious Danes, so that it had lost all the beautie and dignitie that for∣merly it had; this Bishop did all he could to adorne and set it out; but be∣ing vnable belike, to doe so much as he intended, hee remoued his Seate from hence to Norwich, being a citie as then very faire built, spatious, and eminent, where he first erected a Cathedrall Church at his owne charges, as doth appeare by the sequele. Norwich. S. Trinities, the Cathedrall Church. HErebertus dictus Losinga, Abbas quondam Rameseie, The foundati∣on of the Bi∣shops See at Norwich. qui sedem Thedford a Rege Willelmo emerat in Anglia magnus fuit Simonie omes hic postquam erroneum inuentutis impetum deste issit, Ro∣mam iuit ac rediens sedem suam vsque Norwicum transtulit, vbi et celebre fundauit Monasterium de rebus quidem proprijs non Episcopalibus: sed et apud Tedford Monachos cluniacenses instituit, hic septus dicere consueuit. Erranimus inuenes. Emendemus senes: thus much out of an old Manuscript of the Abbey of Euesham, anciently put into English by the Translator of Polychronicon, as followeth. Abowte that time, Herbert, the first Bishop of Norwich Herbert Losange that had ben somtyme Ab∣bot of Ramsay, and was thenne Byshop of Tedford, was a grete noury for Simony, for he had boughte the Bysshopryche of the Kynge. But after warde he was sory, and bywept the vnskylfull rest of his youth. And toke the waye to Rome▪ and came home a∣gayne, and chaunged and torned his See from Tedford to Nor∣wyche. And he founded a solempne Abbaye wyth his owne ca∣tayle, and not wyth the catayle of his Bysshopryche. But at Tedford he ordained Monkes of Cluny that were ryche in the world, and clere of Religion to Godward: And had ofte in mynde the worde of Iherom, That sayd, we erryd in our yougth, amende We vs in our age. His repentance doth also appeare by the context of his Charter, beggining thus. In nomine Patris et ilij & Spiritus sancti, Amen. Herbertus Episcopus, Cart. Antiq. in Arch.

But after they were thrust out by King Henry the eight, there were substituted for them, a Deane, sixe Prebendaries, and others. Witnesses to this his Charter, were King Henry the first, and Maud his Queene; eleuen Bishops, and foure and twenty Earles, Lords, and Abbots: to euery name, the signe of the crosse.

Amen. Godwin de Ang. Ma s de gest. Regum Ang. lib. 4. This Bishop was borne at Orford in Suffolke, his Fathers name was Robert de Losing. Hee was Prior of the monasterie of Fiscane in Norman∣die, and came backe into England at the request of William Rufus, and li∣uing in the Court for a time, behaued himselfe in such sort, that hee was much fauoured of the King, and obtained diuers great preferments at his hands, whereby it came to passe, that within the space of three yeares, hee had so feathered his nest, as he could buy for his Father, the Abbacy of Winchester, and for himselfe, the Bishopricke of Thetford, which I haue partly touched here, and in another place. Hauing finished this pious Fabricke, according to his minde, hee then determined to build an house for himselfe (for as yet he had none in Nor∣wich, the See being so lately remoued from Thetford) and therefore on the north side of the Church, hee founded a stately palace. And more (such was his repentance for his Simony committed) hee built fiue Churches; one ouer against the Cathedrall Church, on the other side of the riuer, cal∣led S. Leonards, another in this Citie also, another at Elmham, a fourth at Linne, and a fift at Yarmouth. He was an excellent Scholler for those times, and writ many learned Treatises, mentioned by Pitsaeus, in his booke de illustribus Anglie Scriptoribus Aetat. duodecima : where he cals him, vir omnium virtutum, et bonarum literarum studijs impensè deditus, mitis, affa∣bilis, corpore venusto, vultu decoro, moribus candidus, vita integer. A man earnestly addicted to the studies of all vertues and good learning; milde, affable, comely of personage, gracefull of countenance, blamelesse in his carriage, pure, innocent, and sincere in the course of his life. The Monkes of Norwich made great meanes and sute to haue this Herbert a ca∣nonised Saint, but such impediments were alwaies in the way, that it could not be obtained. He departed this life the two and twentith of Iuly, in the yeare of grace, one thousand, one hundred and twenty, and was buried in this Church of his owne Foundation, by the High Altar, to whose memory, these verses following were engrauen vpon his monument.

One Euerard, Euerard, Bishop of Norwich. who next succeeded Herbert, lieth here interred; who al∣though, saith Godwin, he enioyed this Bishopricke for a long space, yet time the deuorer of all things, hath left nothing of him to our remem∣brance, but that when he had gouerned his Church 29 yeares, hee ended this life, Octob. 15. 1150. Here in the Presbyterie lay buried the body of Bishop Turbus, Will. Turbus, Bishop of Nor¦wich. a Nor∣man by birth, being in his youth, a Monke, and afterwards Prior of this monasterie. In his time, this Cathedrall Church was burned by casuall fire, he died in the 25. yeare of his consecration, the 17. of Ianuarie. Neere vnto the high Altar, Io. Oxford, Bi∣shop of Nor∣wich. lieth buried the body of Iohn of Oxford, sometimes Deane of Salisbury, and Bishop of this Diocesse. This man fini∣shed the Church which Herbert (being preuented by death) had left vn∣perfected, and repaired that, which by fire was lately defaced. He built di∣uers Hospitals for impotent and diseased people. Hee founded Trinitie Church in Ipswich, and reedified diuers houses which were by fire decai∣ed. He was chaplaine to King Henry the second, and with him, in especiall fauour, euer firmely adhering to his partie against Thomas Becket, who had stubbornely opposed himselfe against his said Soueraigne Lord and Master. He was employed in diuers Embasies, as to Rome, to Seines in France, and to Sicily, about the marriage of Ioane, the third and yongest daughter of the said King Henry, to William, the second of that name, King of Sicill, Duke of Apulia, and Prince of Capua. In the soliditie of good doctrine, in the maturitie of iudgement, and in all the graces of rhetoricall speech, hee did wondrously abound. He was quicke and dexterous in the managing, and prosperous in the dispatching of waightie affaires. Pits. aetat. 13. He writ a History of the Kings of Britaine, as also a Booke, Pro Rege Henrico contra S. Tho mam Cantuariensem, for King Henry against S. Thomas of Canterbury, besides, a treatise of his iourney into Sicily, and certaine Orations and E∣pistles to Richard, Archbishop of Canterbury. He died the 26 yeare of his consecration, the second of Iune, in the se∣cond yeare of King Iohn. Iohn de Grey, Io. Grey, Bi∣shop of Nor∣wich. entirely beloued of King Iohn, who preferred him to this Bishopricke, was here entombed: in whose commendations, Bale and Pit∣seus doe in effect, thus agree. Vir erat foelici et faceto ingenio, eruditione in∣signis, consilio expeditus, et quantumuis in dictis facetus, in factis tamen, vbi res postulabat, senerus, virtutum omnium amator et cultor, omnium vitio∣rum osor et exterminator. Iohanni Anglorum Regi gratissimus, in magna semper authoritate apud ipsum remansit, splendidis functionibus ornatus. A man he was of a pleasant and facetious wit, in the knowledge of all good literature excellent, in counsell ready and intelligent, and howsoeuer in his words merrie and iocond; yet in his actions, as occasion did require, he was seuere and rigorous: a louer and reuerencer hee was of all vertues, and a despiser and rooter out of all vices. He was a gracious Fauourite to King Iohn, euer vnder him in great au∣thoritie, and honoured with offices of especiall trust and confidence. Na cum Rex rebelles Hibernos compescuisset, eorumque vires fregisset, hunc Gra ium tanquam virum strenuum magnae prudentiae, fidelitatis exploratae, reli∣quit ibi supremum Presidem, vt eos auctoritate sua in officio contineret. For when the King, had repressed the rebellious Irish, broken & dispersed then forces; he left this Grey as an hardie able man, of singular wisedome, and tried fidelitie, Prorex or Lord Deputie of Ireland, that by such his power and commission, he might keepe that stiffe-necked nation in obedience. He was well seene in the lawes of the Realme, saith Godwin, wise and of great integritie; De praesul. Angl. in regard whereof the King was very desirous to haue made him Archbishop of Canterbury (of which I haue spoken somewhat before) to which Grace indeed he was solemnly elected, and his election published in the Church before the King, and an infinite number of people: But by the exorbitant authoritie of the Pope, this election was disanulled, whereupon much mischiefe ensued. He built that goodly Hall at Gay wood neare Linne in Norfolke, and the rest of the Fabricke adioyning. Hauing sate about fourteene yeares, hee died neare Poytiers in his returne from Rome: Obijt eodem anno quo Rex Iohannes, saith Bale, in the same yeare in which King Iohn deceased, the first of Nouember. Whose body was con∣ueyed to this his owne Church. He was an Historiographer, and writ a booke which he called Schalecronicon, as also other workes mentioned by Bale in his Centuries.

Hic namque in vsus pauperum, instante tempore famis, omnia vasa sua, & coclearia cum to∣to thesauro suo pauperibus erogauerat. Mat. Paris, Ann. 1257. Vpon the Feast day of Saint Wolstan, the thirteenth of the Calends of Iune, Walter surnamed de Sufield, Bishop of Norwich departed this world at Colchester, from whence his body was conueyed to this Cathedrall Church, here to be honourably interred. At whose Tombe many miracles are reported to be wrought, which are ascribed to his holinesse; For it is remembred of him, that in a time of extreme famine hee sold all his plate, and distributed it to the poore euery pennyworth. He lieth buried in our Ladies Chappell, which was of his owne building. He founded the Hos∣pitall of Saint Giles here in the Citie, The founda∣tion of Saint Giles Hospitall. endowing it with faire possessions, in∣somuch that it was valued at the suppression to be yearely worth fourescore and ten pounds twelue shillings. Si. de Wanton Bishop of Norw. Simon de Wanton, sometimes the Kings Chaplaine, one of his Iustices, and Bishop of this Diocesse, was here interred by his predecessour, Walter de Sufield. He died about the yeare 1265. hauing sate eight yeares, and ob∣tained of the Pope licence to hold all his former liuings in Commendam for foure yeares. In the same Chappell, as I take it, Roger de Sherwyng was entombed, who died about Michaelmas, Rog. Bishop of Norw. 1278. hauing sate thirteene yeares. Of whom I finde little remarkable; yet he is memorable, for that in his time by an in∣cendiarie outrage, the Citizens set fire on the Priorie Church. The story is thus deliuered by our late writers, taken out of Rishanger, the Continuer of Mathew Paris his History, in the last yeare of King Henry the third. About the moneth of Iune, in a Faire that was kept before the gates of the Priory, there fell great debate and discord betwixt the Monkes of Nor∣wich and the Citizens there; which increased so farre, that at length the Citizens with great violence assaulted the Monastery, fired the gates, and forced the fire so with reed and drie wood, that the Church with the books and all other ornaments of the same, and all houses of Office belonging to that Abbey were cleane burned, wasted, and destroyed, so that nothing was preserued except one little Chappell. The King hearing of this detesta∣ble and sacrilegious deuastation, rode to Norwich, where beholding the de∣formed ruines, he could hardly refraine from teares: and caused enquirie to be made of the fact; whereupon thirty young men of the Citie, as also a woman that first carried fire to the gates, were condemned, hanged, and burnt. It is thought, saith Hollinshead, that the Prior of the house, whose name was William de Brunham, was the occasion of all this mischiefe, who had got together armed men, and tooke vpon to keepe the Belfray and Church by force of armes; but the Prior was well enough borne out and defended by this his Bishop. The Monkes for their part appealed to Rome, and so handled the matter, that they not onely escaped punishment, but also for∣ced the Citizens to pay them three thousand Markes, after fiue hundred Markes a yeare toward the reparation of their Church, besides they were adiudged to giue to the vse of the Church, Vnam cuppam de pondere decem librarum auri, & valore centum librarum argenti, A Cuppe weighing ten pounds in gold, and worth an hundred pounds of money. Whereby you may note, saith Speed, the proportion then betweene the value of gold and siluer. This end was made by King Edward the first (his Father being now dead) at the request and solicitation of this Bishop. His next successour William Midleton was also interred in this Church. He reedified the same, being so destroyed and profaned as you haue heard before, and hallowed or consecrated the whole Fabricke anew in the pre∣sence of King Edward the first, and many of his Nobles. He departed this life the last of August, Ann. 1288. in the eleuenth yeare of his Consecra∣tion. Iohn Salmon, Iohn Salmon Bishop of Norw. placed in this See of Norwich by the Pope, was here en∣tombed; he was Lord Chancellour of England for the space of foure yeares. This Bishop built the great Hall, and the Chappell in the Bishops pallace, and a Chappell at the West end of the Church, in which he ordained foure Priests to sing Masse continually. He died Iuly the sixth 1325. William Ayermin likewise by the Popes authority was preferred to this Bishopricke, Will. Ayremin Bishop of Norw. as appeares by the sequele. Cum summus Pontifex nuper Willelmum tunc Canonicum London in Epis∣copum Norwicens. prefecisset. sicut per literas bullatas ipsius summi Pontisi∣cis Regi inde directas satis constabat, ac Rex nono die Nouembris, prox. preteri o per literas suas patentes sub Testimonio Edwardi filij sui primoge∣niti tunc custodis Regni Anglie, Rege extra Regnum existente, prefectionem ipsam gratiose acceptans; cepit fidelitatemipsius Episcopi, & restituit ei tem∣poralia. Nunc Rex ratificans prefectionem & receptionem predict. mandat restituere ei Temporalia. Teste Rege apud Kenelworth, 13. Decemb. Pat. 20. E 2. In the yeare 1319. saith F. Thinne, in his Catalogue of Englands Chan∣cellours, and out of an old anonimall Latine Chronicler, this Will. Ayremin was keeper of the great Seale, and that he was taken prisoner by the Scots: the words of his Author are in effect thus in English. The Countie of Yorke and the countrie adiacent hauing receiued inesti∣mable damages by the Scots, William de Melton, Archbishop of Yorke, Iohn Hotham, Bishop of Ely and Treasurer, the Abbot of Saint Maries Yorke, Sir William Ayremin Priest, Chancellour of England, Deane of Yorke, the Abbot of Selbie, and Sir Iohn Pabeham knight, assembled to∣gether an armie of eight thousand to represse the violence of the enemie; this armie consisted of Clerkes, Monkes, Canons, and other spirituall men of the Church, with Citizens, and Husbandmen, and such other vnapt peo∣ple for the warres. With these, the Archbishop came forth against the Scots, and incountred with them at a place called Mitton, a little village vpon the Riuer of Swale. Ouer which Riuer the Englishmen were no sooner passed, but that the expert warlike Scots came vpon them with a wing in good order of battell, in fashion like to a Shield, eagerly assayling their ene∣mies, who for lacke of good gouernment were easily beaten downe and dis∣comfited, without shewing any great resistance. Corruerunt ex nostris tam in ore gladij quam aquarum scopulis suffocati plusquam quatuor mille ho∣minum ; there were slaine by the sword and drowned in the Riuer of our partie aboue foure thousand persons, saith the Manuscript, and the residue shamefully put to flight. The Archbishop, the Bishop of Ely, the Abbot of Selbie, and diuers other, with helpe of their swift horses, escaped. The Mayor of Yorke named, Nicholas Fleming was slaine. Et capti sunt Domini, Iohannes de Pab ham miles, & Dominus Willelmus de Airemin, Canc. and Sir Iohn de Pabeham, and Sir William Ayremin Priest, were taken prisoners. Iohn Harding who seldome giues condigne praise to the valiant dough∣tie Scot; thus writes of this battell. C p 3. . . . . . . in Myton medowe nere To Swale water, lay then with great power Walter Warren among the haycockes bushed, Vpon the byshop sodenly with Scots yssued And xv hundreth Englyshe there he slewe And home he went with kyng Robart full glad, With prisoners many, mo then men knewe The Byshop fled fro the felde full woo bestad With his Clerkes, that then were full mad. This was called the white Battell, for that it consisted of so many Cler∣gie men. This Bishop died March the 17. hauing sate almost eleuen yeares, at Sharing neare London, whose body was conueyed for buriall to this his owne Church. He gaue two hundred pound for order to be taken that two Monkes (the Cellerers of the Couent) should alwayes sing Masse for his soule. Thomas Piercy was here interred, Tho. Piercy Bi∣shop of a gentleman, howsoeuer right hono∣rably descended, and highly befriended, yet constrayned to admit of this Bishopricke, by the Popes Prouisorie Bull, as followeth. Cum summus Pontifex nuper vacante Ecclesia Norwicen. per mortem Willelmi vltimi Episcopi ibidem, qui apud sedem Apostolicam diem clausit extremum, eidem Ecclesie de venerabili viro Thoma Percy prouiderit, & ip∣sum Thomam in Episcopum loci illius presecerat.

This Bishop gaue vnto the repairing of this Church (which in his time was greatly defaced with a violent tempest) the summe of foure hundred markes, and obtained of the rest of the Clergie a great summe to the same purpose. He bequeathed to the Chaunter of this his Church, an house and certaine lands lying within the Lordship of Kimerle, Gaeriton, Fowrhow, Granthorpe, and Wychelwood, vpon condition he should procure Masse daily to be said for his soule. He died at Blofield not farre off, the eight of August, 1369. Vpon the death of Bishop Percy one Henry Despenser, Hen. Spenser Bishop of . Canon of Salis∣bury, was preferred by the Pope to this Bishopricke: as I finde it thus re∣corded in the Tower. Henricus Despenser Canonicus Saresburien per Papam ad Episcopatum Norwicen. vacantem per mortem Thome vltimi Episcopi ibidem prefectus; fecit regi fidelitate, & habuit restitutionē Temporalium. T.R. apud Clarendon 14. Aug. 2. Par. Pat. Anno 44. Ed. 3. Memb. 6. This man was called the warlike Bishop of Norwich, for that in his youth he had beene a Souldier with a brother of his, one Spenser a gen∣tleman, greatly esteemed for his valour, being a chiefe Commander in the Popes warres: by whose meanes this Henry obtained this dignitie; and ha∣uing changed his vesture but not his conditions, in what manner of life he spent his youth, in the same he most delighted, euen in his waxing yeares. For in the yeare 1381. most memorable was the seruice of this stout Bi∣shop against the rebellious bondmen and Pesants of Norfolke, whom he draue out of their Trenches, slew diuers, and caused their mushrom king Iohn Littestar to be hanged, drawne, and headed; and also caused all others that were the chiefe agents in that rebellion to be put vnto death, and so by that meanes quieted the whole countrey: an action (howsoeuer some will say perhaps, not agreeable to his calling) worthie of eternall honour and remembrance. Not long afterwards, viz. 1383. he had another occasion to shew his martiall prowesse: for being drawne on by Pope Vrban the sixt, to preach the Crusado, and to be generall against Clement the seuenth (whom sundry Cardinals and great Prelates, Tho. Walsing. in vita R. 2. had also elected Pope) hauing a Fifteenth granted to him for that purpose by Parliament, (after strong opposition of almost all the Nobles, who resisted this businesse of the Crosse) went with forces into Flanders, to support the cause of Vrban, against the Antipape Clement, from whence after he had performed many exploits very happi∣ly, taken Graueling, Burbrough, Dunkerke, and Newport, by assault, and bin victor in a set Battell against thirty thousand abettours of Clements claime; he was enforced to returne, as destitute of those further succours which were expected out of England. But the King, vpon pretence that he had not obeyed his royall Mandate, by which he required him, (before he transported) to returne, for a while seised vpon all his Temporalities; to which he found grace with the King to be restored, at the speciall sute of Thomas Arundell, as then Bishop of Ely. The which Seisin and Restitution is thus in effect recorded. Arch. Turris . Hen. Episcopus Norwicens. in Parliamento apud West.

There was great contention betweene this Bishop and his Monkes, for the space of fifteene yeares; but they being too weake for him (as you see all his opposites were) at last were glad to giue him foure hundred markes to enioy their priuiledges in like sort as heretofore they had done. He sate Bishop well neere 37. yeers, and died August 23. 1406. as appeares by this mangled Epitaph vpon his monument.

Before the Altar of Saint George, the body of Bishop Wakering lyeth bu∣ried, who for his life, learning, and wisedome, was highly esteemed: in re∣gard whereof, (before he was aduanced hither to Norwich) King Henry the 4. made him Lord Keeper of the priuy Seale, and so consequently, he was of his priuy Councell, in the yeare 1414. hee was sent to the generall Councell holden at Constance in Heluetia, Hollins. A. 2. H. 5. with Richard, Earle of War∣wicke, the Bishops of Salisbury, Bath, and Hereford, the Abbot of West∣minster, and the Prior of Worcester, with diuers other Doctors and lear∣ned men of the spiritualtie, besides Knights and Esquires, in number all, eight hundred horses, so well appointed and furnished, as well the men, as horses, that all nations meruailed to see such an honourable companie come from a Countrie so farre distant: in this Counsell hee so behaued himselfe, that for learning and wisedome, hee obtained the generall applause of all the assemblie; shortly after his returne, he was consecrated Bishop, viz. the last of May, 1416. and hauing his charge with great praise about nine yeares, he died the ninth of Aprill, one thousand, foure hundred, twentie and fiue. He built the Cloister which is to be seene at this day in the Bishops Pallace, pauing the same with stones of diuers colours. Vpon the dore vnder the Rood loft, I finde this maymed Epitaph fol∣lowing, inlaid in brasse. Hic iacet absconsus sub marmore Presul honestus Walter Lyghart, Bishop of Nor wich.

This man in the catalogue of Bishops is called Walter Hart. In his pre∣decessors daies, the Citizens here of Norwich harbouring in their mindes their old grudge, attempted many things against the Church, but such was the singular wisedome and courage of the said Bishop, whose name was Thomas Browne, that all their enterprises tooke little effect: and now by the policie and discretion of this Lighert, or Hart, the malitious humours of these malecontented Townesmen, before reasonable well allaied, was alto∣gether extinguished. He paued the Church, and during his life, maintained twelue students at Cambridge, with all things necessary for them at his owne charges. He departed this life the first of May, 1472. as appeares by his Epitaph in the twentie and sixt yeare of his consecration, and lieth bu∣ried neere vnto the Rood loft, which he himselfe erected. Here lieth buried the body of Iames Goldwell, Ia. Goldwel, Bi∣shop of Nor∣wich. sometimes Deane of Salis∣bury, Secretarie to King Edward the fourth, and Bishop of this Diocesse, who died in February, M.cccc.lxxxxviii. This Bishop was a great repairer or new builder of great Chart Church in Kent, where (as it is said) he was borne. Here lieth buried the body of Thomas Ian, Tho. Ian. Bi∣shop of Nor∣wich. who died the first yeare of his consecration, viz. anno 1499. of Nor∣wich. After the decease of Ian, Richard Nix succeeded, of whom I finde little worth the rehearsing (saith Godwin in his Catalogue of Bishops) hee hath the report of a vicious and dissolute liuer; was blinde long before his death, sate 36 yeares, and died, An. 1536. It is reported yet, that this Bishop built the north crosse Ile of this Church, and guilded the roofe of the same, vpon which his cote of Armes is to be seene. In the Chapter House was a goodly monument to the memory of Sir Thomas Windham knight, with this (now maymed) Inscription. Orat ... Tho. Wyndham militis et Elisabethe vxoris eius ... vnus con∣stabul ... Domini Regis Hen. 8. ac vn ... militum pro corpore ... This Knight, with others, went with Sir Edward Howard, Admirall, into Bi cay, the fourth of King Henry the eight. Here lieth Dame Elisabeth Calthrop, wife of Sir Francis Calthrop, and after, of Iohn Culpeper Esquire ... Cal hrops, sometime a familie of great account in these parts. Here lieth buried the body of Ione, the wise of Sir Thomas Erpingham, Knight of the Garter, as appeareth by her Will made by licence of her husband, the last of May, 1404 and proued 14 of Iuly next following. Orate pro animabus Thome Windham militis, Eleanore et domine Elisa∣bethe vxorum eius.

This Knight lieth buried in the Chapter house vnder a goodly faire monument, if it were not so much defaced. He receiued the order of knight∣hood from the hands of Sir Edward Howard, Lord Admirall of England the fourth of King Henry the eight, at Croiton Bay in France. He did good seruice at the winning of Turney and Turwin, as also in other places; this hath beene a name of exemplarie note and knights degree at Cowtherke in this Tract for many descent. Richard Brome. Hic iacet Richardus Brome Armiger cuius anime propitietur Deus. On the wall by him is a monument with his atchieuement, cut, with helme, coate, mantle and creast: his Creast is a bonch of broome greene, with golden flowers on a wreath. Next him, lies vnder an arched monument, the body of one Bosuile, or Boswell, Boswell. sometime Prior of this Church, with this Inscription on the vpper part of the Arch. O tu qui transis, vir, aut mulier, puer an sis Respice picturas, apices lege, cerne figuras: Et memor esto tui; sic bene disce mori. Vnder it, are three pictures of dead mens skuls, one with teeth, another without an vpper chappe, and onely two teeth in the nether; and the third without either chaps or teeth, betweene each of which is written, O morie∣ris. O morieris. O morieris. The Familie of Bosvile is very ancient, farre branched, and of knightly degree, as it will appeare in many places of these my ensuing labours: The amilie of Bosvile o Bos∣well. of which in this place, and vpon this occasion, I will onely giue a little touch. In the Church of Seuenoke, within the County of Kent, remaine the achiuements and Funerall rights of Raphe Bosvile of Bradburne in the said Parish of Seuenok, Esquire, Clerk of her late Maiesties Court of Wards and Liueries, Grandsier of Sir Raphe Bosvile, now of Bradburne, and Sir Hen∣ry Bosvile, of Eynsford in the foresaid County, Knights, descended line∣ally from the Bosviles of Erdsley, and Newhall in the County of Yorke. The inhabitants of Seuenoke say, that whilst the said Raph Boswell liued, being employed vpon many occasions for the publique; hee deserued and had the reputation of a most worthie Patriot, and out of his particular to their Towne, hee procured of Queene Elizabeth a Charter of Incorpora∣tion, for the setling and gouernment of Lands formerly giuen for the maintenance of a Free-schoole, and thirteene Almes-people in the said Pa∣rish. For the more entire establishment whereof, Sir Raph his Grand∣childe, cooperating with other noble friends in so charitable a suite, obtai∣ned an Act of Parliament in the 39. of Queene Elizabeth, besides other benefites procured by him in behalfe of this Corporation and Parish. Whereupon a well wishing versifier alluding to the Creste of this Familie, which is an Oxe comming out of a Groue of Oakes, tooke occasion to ex∣presse his affection in this Distich. Dij tibi dent Bosville boues villasque Radulphe, Nec Villâ careat Bosue, vel Illa boùe. Here lieth vnder a faire marble stone, one of the ancient Familie of the Cleres, Clere and his wife. and his wife, as appeares by their Armes thereupon engrauen, for the brasse is quite taken away. Of which worthy Familie I speake here∣after. Pray for the soule of Elisabeth Waters, Elis.

Simon Folkarde Vnder a monument in the South Crosse Isle lieth one Baconthorp a Prior of this Church, Baconthorpe Prior. the Inscription is worne or torne out of the stone. I will not say that this Prior was Iohn Baconthorp, Io. Baconthorpe the resolute little Doctor. the Resolute Doctor who flourished in the raigne of King Edward the third. For I finde that he was buried amongst the Carmelites at London; howsoeuer he was borne at Blackney in this County, brought vp at Oxford and Paris in France; and so exceeding deeply learned he was as well in Diuinitie, as in both the Ciuill and Canon Lawes, that he proceeded Doctor in either faculty, in both the said Vniuersities, and got the surname Doctoris resoluti, or Resolute or Resoluing Doctor; Nemo doctius consundebat Iudaos; nemo neruosius consutabat Turcos, vel quoscunque infideles; nemo falicius ex pugnabat hae∣reticos; nemo solidiùs Christi veritatem dilucidabat; nemo manifestius An∣tichrists falsitatem & imposturas detegebat, suisque coloribus deping bat; nemo subtiliùs difficiles nodos soluebat; nemo clariùs obscura sacrae scriptu∣rae loca explanabat, & sensus reconditos & arcana mysteria dilucidius appe∣riebat. No man more learnedly confounded the Iewes; no man more pithilie confuted the Turkes, or any other Infidels; no man more prosperously conuinced the Heretickes; no man more solidly declared the truth of Christ; no man more manifestly discouered the deceits and iuglings of An¦tichrist, nor so painted him out in his proper colours; No man more sub∣tilly resolued hard questions; and neuer any man more clearly expounded, explaned, or laid more apertly open, the hidden sense, the secret mysteries, and the obscure places of the sacred Scripture, Pit. Ann 1346. saith Pitseus. Baconthorpe a Dwarfe. He was like another Zacheus, little of stature, but immense in wit and vnderstanding, insomuch as it was a wonder to know so many vertues in∣habite together in so small a mansion. He writ so many exact learned Vo∣lumes, that his bodie could not beare what his wit brought forth. Nam, si moles librorum cius, composita sarcina, auctoris humeris imposita fuisset, homulum sine dubio comprimere suffecisset. For, if the bulke or pile of the bookes which he writ, had beene put into a bagge, and laid vpon his shoul∣ders, questionlesse it would haue prest the slender short dwarfe to death, saith my foresaid Author. Much more might bee said of this little-great man, but I am called for my selfe to the Presse; and to speake more then I haue done in the praise of little men, I may be thought to flatter my selfe. He died in the yeare 1346. in the twentieth of the raigne of King Ed∣ward the third, I read in a booke of the order of Carmelites (of which Fra∣ternitie he was one, as also Prouinciall of them all throughout all England) penned by Iohn Bale before his conuersion, a part of an Eulogium compo∣sed to the memory of this Baconthorpe, which may serue for an Epitaph.

Sir William Bolen knight of the Bath. Hic iaces corpus Willelmi Boleyn militis, qui obijt x. Octobris, Anno Dom. M.ccccc.v. Cuius anime propitietur Deus. Amen. Let it be the greatest honour to this noble deceased Knight, for that he was great Grandfather to the most renowned and victorious Princesse Eli∣zabeth, late Queene of England, which will best appeare by the Light of Great Britaine, learned Camden, in his Introduction to the History which he writ of her long and prosperous raigne: beginning as followeth. The Linage and descent of Elizabeth Queene of England (saith he) was by her Fathers side truly Royall: for daughter she was to King Henry the eight, grand daughter to Henry the seuenth, and great grand-daughter to Ed▪ the fourth. By the Mothers side her descent was not so high: how∣beit noble it was, and spread abroad by many and great Alliances through∣out England and Ireland. Her great grand-fathers father was, Ieffrey Bo∣len, a man of Noble birth in Norfolke, Lord Maior of the Citie of Lon¦don, in the yeare 1457. and at the same time honoured with the dignitie of Knighthood. An vpright honest man, of such estimation, that Thomas Lord Hoo, and Hastings, Knight of the Order of Saint George, gaue him his daughter, and one of his heires, to wife; and of such wealth, as he matched his daughters into the Noble houses of the Cheineys, Heydons, and For∣tescues, left his sonne a goodly inheritance, and bequeathed a thousand pounds of English money to bee bestowed vpon the poore in the Citie of London, and two hundred in Norfolke. This mans sonne William Bolen was chosen amongst eighteene most choice Knights of the Bath at the Co∣ronation of King Richard the third: to whom Thomas Earle of Ormond (who was in such fauour with the Kings of England, that hee alone of all the Nobleman of Ireland, had his place and voice in the Parliaments of England, and aboue the Barons of England also) gaue his daughter and one of his heires in marriage. By her (besides daughters married to Shel∣ton, Calthorp, Clere, and Sackvill, men of great wealth and noble descent, and other children) hee begat Thomas Bolen, whom being a young man, Thomas Howard Earle of Surry, who was afterward Duke of Norfolke, a man much renowned for his worthie seruice, and atchiuements in the warres, chose to be his sonne in law, giuing vnto him his daughter Eliza∣beth in marriage: and Henry the eight, after he had performed one or two very honourable Embasies, made him first Treasurer of his Houshold; Knight of the Order of Saint George, and Viscount Rochford, and after∣wards Earle of Wiltshire and Ormond, and made him Lord Keeper of the priuie Seale. This Thomas, among other children, begat Anne Bolen, who in her tender yeares being sent into France, attended on Mary of England, wife to Lewis the twelfth; and then on Claudia of Britaine, wife to Francis the first; and after she was dead, on Margaret of Alencon, who with the first fauoured the Protestants Religion springing vp in France. Being retur∣ned into England, and admitted amongst the Queenes Maides of Honour, and being twenty two yeares of age, King Henry in the thirtie eight yeare of his age, did for her modestie, empered with French pleasantnesse, fall deeply in loue with, and tooke her to wife, by whom he had issue Eliza∣beth aforesaid Queene of England.

For times I rightly tell, to me of's Art, If my learnd keeper will his helpe impart. Tho. Scot, Philo. In imitation of this, it may bee that Thomas Scot, in his Philomythie, makes a Clocke to compare with a Diall, and the difference to be partly de∣cided by the Wethercocke: of which a little, although not much to the pur∣pose I confesse. Vpon a Church, or steeples side neere hand, A goodly Clocke of curious worke did stand; Which ouerpaysde with lead, or out of frame, Did time miscall, and euery houre misname. The Diall hearing this, aloud gan crye, Kind neighbour Clocke, your glib tongue tels a lye. Reforme your errour, for my Gnomon saith You gad too fast, and misse an houres faith. Foole (quoth the Clocke,) reforme thy selfe by me, The fault may rather in thy Gnomon be. Had'st thou told euer truth, to what end then, Was I plac'd here, by th'art of cunning men? The Weathercocke vpon the steeple standing, And with his sharpe eye, all about commanding, Heard their contention, wild them to appeale To him the chiefe of all that common weale. Told them that he was set to ouersee, And to appease, to guide, and to agree, All difference in that place; and whatsoere He setteth downe, from iustice cannot erre. This my ingenious Author doth vayle vnder the Clocke, the teaching part of the militant Church, which consists of the Clergie.

It is in the Netherlands written Hoer, but pronounced Hoor, as wee yet pronounce it, though in our later English Ortography (I know not with reason) some write it Whore.

Balei de Carmelitis. ac sempiterne clementie, pietatis affectu pro alijs rogare cogimar, qui pro nostris peccatis nequaquam sufficimus; confisi tamen de tua gratuita benignitate humiliter deprecamur, vt per meritum passionis vnigenitiatque dilecti filij tui Iesu Christi, & per merita piissime matris eius, ac omnium Sanctorum, atque Sanctarum, animas Fratrum nostrorum, & omnium fidelium defunctorum, a penis liberare digneris, qui liberasti tres pueros de Camino ignis ardentis, et de manu Regis iniqui. Per eundem Chri∣stum Dominum nostrum. Amen. Now here to make an end of the Funerall Monuments which I finde in this famous Citie, as also to take my leaue of the same, may it please you runne ouer these verses of Iohn Ionston a Scottish Britan, penned in the praise of the foresaid Citie of Norwich. The praise of Norwich. Vide Camden. Vrbs speciosa situ, nitidis pulcherrima tectis, Grata peregrinis, delitiosa suis. Bellorum sedes, trepido turbante tumultu, Tristia Neustriaco sub duce damna tulit. Victis dissidijs, postquam caput ardua coelo Extulit, immensis creuit opima opibus. Cultus vincit opes, et cultum gratia rerum, Quam benè, si luxus non comitetur opes Omnia sic adeò sola haec sibi sufficit, vt si Fors regno desit, haec caput esse queat. Thus translated by Philemon Holland, Doctor of Physicke. A Citie seated daintily, most faire built she is knowne, Pleasing and kinde to strangers all, delightfull to her owne. The seat of war, whiles ciuill stirs, and tumults yet remaind, In William the Normans daies, she grieuous losse sustaind. These broiles and iars once past her head aloft againe She bare, in richnesse infinite, and wealth, she grew amaine. Her port exceeds that wealth, and things all superfine, this port How happy were it, if excesse with such wealth did not sort. So alsufficient in her selfe, and so compleate is she, That if neede were, of all the Realme, the Mistresse she might be. Attilborrough. The foundati∣on of the Col∣ledge of At∣tilborrough. The Booke of Woodbridge saith, that Sir William Mortimer Knight, Lord of this Mannor, here founded a Chappell of the holy Crosse, who died on Tuesday the 12 of Nouember, 1297. and was buried in this his owne Chappell: others say that Sir Robert Mortimer, and Margery his wife, were the founders of a Colledge here, which they likewise consecra∣ted to the honour of the holy Crosse, valued in the Kings bookes, at twen∣ty one pounds, sixteene shillings, halfe pennie. Burials at At∣tilborrough. Burials in the Chappell of this Colledge, were as followeth. Sir William Mortimer, as before: Sir Robert Mortimer, who died at Attilburgh, the 25 of September, 1387. Sir Thomas Mortimer: Mary Falstalph, who was wife to Sir Thomas Mortimer, who died the second of May, 1406. Sibill Mortimer died the 9 of Nouember, 1334. Margery Falstalphe, daughter of ... died 24. of October, 1341. Constantine Mortimer, Father to Con∣stantine, who died 12 Nouember, 1334. Sir Iohn Radcliffe, knight of the Garter, in the raigne of Henry the sixt: Roger his brother, and Philip his wife: Thomas Brampton, Robert Wetnall. Alice Warner. Elisabeth, wife of Thomas Garret, Esquire. Of this Village, and the foundation of the Colledge, thus Camden writes. Attilborrough, saith he, the seat of the Mortimers, an ancient family, who being different from those of Wigmore, bare for their Armes, a shield Or, Seme de floures de Lyz Sables, and founded here a Collegiat Church, where there is little now to be seene: the Inheritance of these Mortim rs, hath by marriage long since accrued to the Radcliffes, Sir Alex. Rad∣cliffe of Ord∣sall now owner of Attilborro Anu. 1031. now Earles of Sussex, to the Familie of Fitz-Ralph, and to Sir Ralph Bigot : it is the inheritance at this day of Sir Alexander Radcliffe of Ordsall, in the County of Lan∣caster, knight of the Bath. Windham. William d Albiny, The founda∣tion of the Pri∣ory of Ex . Lond. Butler to King Henry the first, founded here a Prio∣ry, of which, thus much out of his Charter, as followeth. Notum sit. &c. quod Ego Willelmus de Alben yo Pincerna Domini Re∣gis Henrici primido concedo, &c. Priori et conuentui de Wymundeham in liberam, puram, et perpetuam eleemosinam pro salute anime mee, et vxoris mee patris mei & matris mee, et omnium parentum meorum totam Ecclesi∣am de Wymundeham cum omnibus pertinencijs, &c. Test. Rog. Bygoth, et filij eius, &c. He endowed this his religious edifice, with faire possessions, consecrated it to the blessed Virgin Mary, placed blacke Monkes therein, and gaue it to the Abbey of Saint Albans for a Cell: it was valued in the Exchequer, to be yearely worth seuentie two pounds, fiue shillings, foure pence. From a Cell to Saint Albans, The Priory made an Ab∣bey. it was aduanced to an Abbey, vpon the oc∣casion following set downe by Iohn Wheathamstead. Iohn, the seuenth of that Christian name, Abbot of Saint Albans, could not endure a certaine Monke of the house, whom hee had made Archdea¦con, whose name was Stephen London, because hee would tell him some∣times of his faults. Ordine septenus dum rexit ouile Iohannes, Et baculum gessit, Io. Whe onssea Mss. in b b. C t. cetumque gregis benedixit, Nunquam pacifico bene cernere sciuit ocello Quend m confratrem quem fecerat Archileuitam. Therefore to be rid of his company, whose lookes and admonishments were so distastfull, the Abbot perswades the Archleuite or Archdeacon to take vpon him the charge of this Priory of Windham, as then void of a Gouernour, in these or the like words. Ecce Prioratus Wymundam nomine dictus, Iam vacat absque patre, vacans stat et absque Priore: Huic te prefecimus, in prepositumque creamus, Cur se disponas ilec cito quoque pergas, Est lacus insignis apud et nos grandis honoris. The Archdeacon Stephen accepts of this promotion, which is thus in he said Manuscript exprest. Aduertens Frater quod erat sibi victricus alter, Pastor et ille sibi quasi prenignus stomachanti, Censuit expediens per tempus vt absoret absens, Quam m l sub curuo sic viuere semper ocello, Illius in plac um necflexum cernere vultum; Pergere consensit elluc properans et adiuit. This Stephen pleased both his flocke and Founder, wondrous well, but displeased his Father the foresaid Abbot, Iohn of S. Albans, who within the yeare, sent expresse commandement to discharge him of his Priorship, which was hainously taken both by himselfe and his Patron or Founder, whose name, saith my Author, was one Andrew Ogard. Miles preualidus, miles locuplesque peritus. In so much, that they ioyned in petition to the Pope, that it would Holinesse, that the Abbey of S. Albans might haue no iurisdiction the Priory of Windham, that the Priory might be altered into an Ab∣ , and that the Prior thereof might euer after be honoured with the title Abbot; which was granted, as you may reade in these subsequent verses. Optinuit tandem Prior Abbas vt sit ibidem Ac Abbathia que cella prius fuit vna, Istius Eccelesie, sic migrauit sine fine Non sine dedecote dicti Patris que rubore. The time of this alteration was in the beginning of the raigne of Henry the fourth, as it is explained thus by the said Whethamstead. M. semel, quinus, C quater tune fuit annus, De tanto demptis numero tantummodo binis, Cum fuerant facta iam dicta priusque peracta, Ista modo celle retractio pre recitate; Tunc exeunte septeno Patre Iohanne Et Fundatore famoso milite valde Ogard Andreas fuerat qui nomine dictus; Stephanus et London Abbas qui primus ibidem. Burials at . But now at length (for I haue beene too long holden in this brable) to come to the burials in this Abbey Church. First, the Founder, William de Albeney, Earle of Arundell, vpon whose Monument, this Epitaph was engrauen. Hunc Pincerna locum fundauit, et hic iacet, illa Quae dedit huic domui, iam sine fine tenet.

Et quia Nullus erat de nullo nil tibi christe. Here lyeth None, one worse then none for euer thought, And because None, of none to thee O Christ, giues nought, I haue read another Epitaph of this sirname, but not so well rimed. Hic recubat Nullus, nullo de sanguine cretus: Nullus apud viuos, Nullus apud Superos. None lieth here, of linage none descended Amongst men None, None mongst the Saints befrended. Reynham East.

On the North side of this Church there lieth one buried in the wall vnder a marble, vpon which is the resemblance of a man crosse-legged, all in male armour, his belt by his side, and other accoutrements of great an∣tiquitie: some gesse him to haue beene one of the Bardolfes.

Here is a faire Tombe vnder which lieth buried Anne Lady and wife of Sir Clement Heigham knight, who died .... aetatis 84. Higham a Towne in Suffolke, which giues name to this worthy very ancient family of Higham. Lib. 2. cap. 16. Michael Lord Montaigne in his Essay of Glory, writes that his Ance∣stors haue beene surnamed Higham ; I haue no name, saith he, that is suffi∣ciently mine: Of two I haue, the one is common to all my race, yea and al∣so to others. There is a family at Paris, and another at Montpellier, called Montaigne, another in Brittany, and one in Zantoigne, surnamed de la Montaigne. Lord Mon∣taigne surna∣med Higham. The remouing of one only sillable may so confound our webbe, as I shall haue a share in their glory, and they perhaps a part of my shame. And my Ancestors haue heretofore beene surnamed Heigham, or Hyquem, a surname which also belongs to a house well knowne in England. Sir William Butts knight, and his Lady. Here is another Tombe on the South side of the Chancell, vpon which is the pourtraiture of Sir VVilliam Butts, in his complete armour kneeling, his sword by his side, his spurres, his helmet at his feet. His Lady by him kneeling, hauing her coat-armour. Here are the coats of Butts and Bacon quartered vpon the Tombe; Ar∣werton, saith Camden in Suffolke, the house long since of the Family of the Baco s who held this Mannor and Brome, by conducting all the footmen of Suffolke and Norfolke from S.

Who lieth entombed in S. Pauls with his two wiues. Who died An. 1578. You may reade this Inscription vpon the said Monument. Hic Nicolaum ne Baconem conditum Existima illum, tam diu Britannici Regni secundum columen, exitium Malis, Bonis Asylum, caeca quem non extulit Ad hunc honorem sors, sed aequitas, fides, Doctrina, pietas, vnica & prudentia; Neu morte raptum crede: quia vnica breui Vita perennes emerit duas, agit Vitam secundam caelites inter animus, Fama implet orbem, vita quae illi tertia est; Hac positum in Ara est corpus, olim animi domus, Ara dicata sempiternae Memoriae.

A man, saith he, in that age of such varietie and depth withall, of excellent learning, that he was had in exceeding great admiration among the Itali∣ans, and commonly called the Resolute Doctor. The Resolute Doctor. Whence it is, that Paulus Pansa thus writeth of him. If thy minde stand to enter into the secret power of the Almighty and most mercifull God, no man hath written of his Essence more exactly. If any man desireth to learne the causes of things, or the effects of Nature; if he wish to know the sundrie motions of heauen, and the contrary qualities of the Elements, this man offereth himselfe as a storehouse to furnish him. The armour of Christian Religion, of better proofe and defence then those of Vulcans making against the Iewes, this resolute Doctor alone hath de∣liuered. Sculthorpe. Iohn Vnct n.

In so much that William the Conque∣rour could not winne it by assault, vntill a Monke betraied it into his hands, vpon this condition, that himselfe might be made Abbot thereof, which was done accordingly: An Abbot of Holme han∣ged. but forth with this new Abbot for being a traitour (as the inhabitants make report) was hanged vp by the Kings commande∣ment, and so iustly punished for his treason. After the first foundation of this Abbey by King Knute, her reuenues were greatly augmented, and her building enlarged by Edward the Con∣fessor, and Editha his Queene, with the consent of fiue Dukes, and of all, or the most of the Lords spirituall and temporall within his kingdome, as it appeares by his Charter in Arch Turris Lond. Cart. Ant. It was dedicated to the honour of Christ and Saint Benedict, replenished with blacke Monkes Benedictines, and valued in the Exchequer, at sixe hundred seuenty seuen pounds, nine shillings, eight pence, qua. Clipesby. Not farre from the foresaid Abbey, Camd. in Norf. is the Parish and Lordship of Cli∣pesby, which gaue name, saith Camden, to a familie of ancient note in this tract, whereof there hath beene diuers Knights; where after it had passed in the names of Algar, Elfled, and Odberd, all sirnamed de Clipesby, as ap∣peareth by many vndated Deedes, which I haue seene; it came about the first of King Iohn, to Iohn de Clipesby, Iohn Clipesby. and from him lineally to the last Iohn heire male of that line. On whose Monument in this Church of Cli∣pesby are empaled the Armes of Ierningham, Iohn Clipesby. Woodhouse, Spelman, Paston, all Knightly families of that countrey, with whom the Clipesbies had for∣merly matched. By Iulian a daughter and coheire of this last Iohn, married to Sir Randall Crewe, of Crewe in the County of Chester Knight, after Lord chiefe Iu∣stice of England, the old surname of the Lord of this Mannor was changed, but not the bloud. For, she left, besides a daughter, two sonnes; the eldest her heire christened with the name of her paternall familie; Clipesby, now Sir Clipesby Crew Knight. She the said Iulian died at Kewe in the County of Surrey, in the yeare 1603. and was in the Chancell of the Church of Richmond, decently interred, with this Inscription vpon her Monument. Antiqua fuit orta domo, pia viuit, iniuit Virgo pudica Thorum, Sponsa pudica polum. In this Church are diuers other Funerall Monuments for the Clipesbies, but so defaced as neither Inscription nor coate-armes are remaining vpon them, to giue me any further light. Oby.

A Priory of blacke Canons founded by one Richard Ward, who tooke vpon him holy Orders, and liued in this house of his owne foundation, which he consecrated to the honour of God, our blessed Lady, and Saint Stephen ; it was valued at the suppression, at thirty nine pounds, nine shil∣lings.

Here is an ancient monument in this Church to the memory of one of the Shornborns or Shernburns, Shernburne. but so fouly defaced, as nothing remaines to know the man who lies vnder it, sauing a Vulture splaid, which is the Crest of the Shernborns. Many other Crests and Coate Armes are there also, Shernb rn, the second Christian Church of i is Country by . which I meddle little withall; yet to vse Camdens words, I doe not see how this Church could haue bin omitted, for that Foelix the Burgundian, (Bishop of this Diocesse) who first brought the East-En∣glishmen to the Christian faith, and state of perpetuall felicitie, built in this place, the second Church of Christians in this Country, for the first he founded at Babingley where he landed. Langley.

The Catalogue of Religious houses, (which is very imperfect) saith that the Ancestor of the wife of Sir Francis Bigot Knight, together with her sisters, were the Founders. Another tels me, that Sir Roger Kell, Knight, was the first founder, and that the Patronage thereof, came to the Vffords, and Dacres by marriage; but of this name there is a Religious house in Lecestershire, another in the County of Hertford, and so there may be a mistake. A Nunnery it was, va∣lued at one hundred twenty eight pounds, nineteene shillings, nine pence, halfe penny. The persons of remarkable account interred in this Abbey Church, were these.

This Monastery was found at the sup∣pression to be in the Kings bookes, foure hundred eighteene pounds sixe shillings, three pence halfe penny, of yearely reuenues. This Hugh the Founder was created Earle of Norfolke by King Stephen in the first yeare of his raigne.

It should seeme by the premisses that this Roger Bigot, who was Sewer to King Henry the first, and Father of the foresaid Hugh : was the first foun∣der of this religious Edifice, or at least wise of some other in this Towne, for Monkes of the order of Cluny. And Stow in his Annalls agrees with my Author Ordericus. This yeare, Stow saith he, Maurice Bishop of London, Robert Fitzhamon, Roger Bigot, founder of the Monastery of Monkes at Thetford, Richard Redvers Councellours to the King, Milo Crispen, and many other Noble∣men of England deceased. Roger Bigot, Roger Bigot Earle of Norf. the second of that surname, Earle of the East Angles, or Norfolke. He died about the yeare 1218. and was here interred.

Io Mowbray Duke of Nor¦folke, and Elea¦nor his wife. Iohn Lord Mowbray, Duke of Norfolke, Earle Marshall of England, Earle of Nottingham, Lord and Baron of Segraue, and of Gower, sonne and successour of Iohn, the first Duke of Norfolke in the dignities afore∣said, was here entombed with his wife Elianor, daughter of William Lord Bourchier, and sister of Henry Bourchier, Earle of Essex. He died in the first yeare of King Edward the fourth. Iohn Lord Mowbray Duke of Norfolke. Iohn Mowbray sonne of Iohn aforesaid, who in his Fathers dayes was created Earle Warren and Surrey: and hauing enioyed these and his fa∣thers Honours for the space, dyed without issue at his Castle of Framing∣ham in Suffolke, in the fifteenth yeare of King Edward the fourth, and was here entombed. Iohn Lord Ho∣ward Duke of Norfolke. Sir Iohn Howard knight, (sonne of Sir Robert Howard knight, and of Margaret his wife, daughter and coheire of Thomas Mowbray Duke of Norfolke) first made Baron by king Edward the fourth, 1461. Quia postea constituit eum Capitaneum Armate potentie super mare, Ex Arch▪ Turr. Lond. Test. Rege apud West. Pat. anno 10. Ed. 4. M. 13. was here interred, as I finde in the Col∣lections of Francis Thinne Lancaster Herald. In the yeare 1483. he was created Duke of Norfolke by King Richard the third, in whose aide he was slaine at Bosworth field on Monday the two and twentieth of Aug. 1485. He was warned by diuers to refraine from the field, insomuch that the night before he should set forward toward the King, one wrote this rime vpon his gate: Hollins. pa. 759. Iack of Norffolk be not too bold For Dikon thy Master is boght and sold. Yet all this, notwithstanding, he regarding more his oath, his honour, and promise made to King Richard, like a gentleman, and as a faithfull subiect to his Prince, absented not himselfe from his master, but as he faithfully li∣ued vnder him, so he manfully died with him, to his great fame and laud. And therefore though his seruice was ill employed in aide of a Tyrant (whom it had beene more honourable to haue suppressed then supported) yet because he had vpon his fealtie vndertaken to fight in his quarrell, he thought it lesse losse of life and liuing, then of glory and honour; so that he might haue said in respect of his loyaltie, and promised truth testified with constancie to the death; Est mihi supplicium causa fuisse pium. This passage is wondrously well deliuered to vs in verse, by an honou∣rable late writer, thus. Sir Iohn Beau∣mont Baronet deceased, in his Poeme of Bos∣worth field. Long since the King had thought it time to send For trustie Norfolke, his vndaunted friend, Who hasting from the place of his abode, Found at the doore a world of papers strow'd; Some would affright him from the Tyrants aide, Affirming that his Master was betraide; Some laid before him all those bloudy deeds, From which a line of sharpe reuenge proceeds With much compassion, that so braue a Knight Should serue a Lord, against whom Angels fight; And others put suspitions in his minde, That Richard most obseru'd, was most vnkinde. The Duke a while these cautious words reuolues With serious thoughts, and thus at last resolues. If all the Campe proue traytors to my Lord, Shall spotlesse Norfolke falsifie his word; Mine oath is past, I swore t'vphold his Crowne, And that shall swimme, or I with it will drowne. It is too late now to dispute the right, Dare any tongue since Yorke spread forth his light, Nort umberland, or Buckingham defame, Two valiant Cliffords, Roos, or Beaumonts name, Because they in the weaker quarrell die? They had the King with them, and so haue I. But euery eye the face of Richard shunnes For that foule murder of his brothers sonnes: Yet lawes of Knighthood gaue me not a sword To strike at him; whom all with ioynt accord Haue made my Prince, to whom I tribute bring▪ I hate his vices, but adore the King. Victorious Edward, if thy soule can heare Thy seruant Howard, I deuoutly sweare, That to haue sau'd thy children from that day, My hopes on earth should willingly decay; Would Glouster then my perfect faith had tried, And made two graues, when Noble Hastings died. This said, his troopes he into order brings. A little after he giues vs a touch of the Dukes valour, and deciphers the manner of his death, in these matchlesse numbers which follow: Here valiant Oxford and fierce Norfolke meete, And with their speares each other rudely greete; About the aire the shiuer'd peeces play, Then on their swords their Noble hands they lay, And Norfolke first a blow directly guides To Oxfords head, which from his helmet slides Vpon his arme, and biting through the steele, Inflicts a wound, which Vere disdaines to feele, He lifts his Fauchion with a threatning grace, And hewes the Beuer off from Howards face▪ This being done, he with compassion charm'd Retires, asham'd to strike a man disarm'd: But straight a deadly shaft, sent from a bow, (Whose master, though far off, the Duke could know) Vntimely brought this combat to an end, And pierc'd the braine of Richards constant friend. When Oxford saw him sinke, his noble soule Was full of griefe, which made him thus condole. Farewell true Knight, to whom no costly graue Can giue due honour: would my teares might saue Those streames of blood, deseruing to be spilt In better seruice: had not Richards guilt Such heauie weight vpon his fortune laid Thy glorious vertues had his sinnes outwaighd. Thomas Ho∣ward, Duke of Norfolke. Sir Thomas Howard, Knight of the Garter, Earle of Surrey, and Duke of Norfolke, sonne and heire of the foresaid Iohn, thus slaine, was here likewise entombed: who died in the sixteenth yeare of the raigne of King Henry the eight, 1524. This Thomas was with his father in the forefront of the foresaid Battell, where he had the leading of the Archers, which King Richard so placed, as a bulwarke to defend the rest. The martiall prowesse of this Earle in the pight field, and his resolute braue carriage being taken prisoner, are deline∣ated to the life by my said Author Sir Iohn Beaumont, the particulars wher∣of, if they may seeme as pleasing to you in the reading, as they were to me in the writing, cannot be any way tedious here to set downe: for they are sinnewy strong liues, and will draw you, no doubt, with them along. Couragious Talbot, had with Surrey met, And after many blowes begins to fret, That one so yong in Armes, should thus vnmoou'd, Resist his strength, so oft in warre approou'd. And now the Earle beholds his fathers fall, Whose death like horrid darkenesse frighted all: Some giue themselues as captiues, others flie; But this yong Lion casts his gen'rous eye On Mowbrayes Lion, painted in his shield, And with that King of beasts, repines to yeeld The field (saith he) in which the Lyon stands, Is blood, and blood I offer to the hands Of daring foes; but neuer shall my flight Dye blacke my Lyon, which as yet is white. His enemies (like cunning Huntsmen) striue, In binding snares to take their prey aliue, While he desires t'expose his naked brest, And thinkes the sword that deepest strikes, is best. Yong Howard single with an Army fights, When mou'd with pitie, two renowned knights, Strong Clarindon, and valiant Coniers trye, To rescue him, in which attempt they dye. Now Surrey fainting, scarse his sword can hold, Which made a common souldier grow so bold, To lay rude hands vpon that noble flower, Which he disdaining (anger giues him power) Erects his weapon with a nimble round, And sends the Peasants arme to kisse the ground: This done, to Talbot he presents his blade, And saith, It is not hope of life hath made This my submission, but my strength is spent, And some perhaps of villaine blood will vent My wearie soule: this fauour I demand, That I may dye by your victorious hand. Nay God forbid, that any of my name (Quoth Talbot ) should put out so bright a flame, As burnes in thee (braue youth) where thou hast err'd, It was thy fathers ault, since he preferr'd A Tyrants Crowne, before the iuster side. The Earle still mindfull of his birth, replide. I Wonder Talbot, that thy noble heart Insults on ruines of the vanquisht part: Wee had the right, if now to you it flow, The fortune of your swords hath made it so: I neuer will my lucklesse choyce repent, Nor can it staine mine honour or descent, Set Englands Royall wreath vpon a stake, There will I fight, and not the place forsake. And if the will of God hath so dispos'd, That Richmonds brow be with the Crowne inclos'd, I shall to him or his, giue doubtlesse signes, That duty in my thoughts, not faction, shines: Which he proued to be true in the whole course of his life, which was depensild vpon a Table, and fixed here to his funerall monument; a copie whereof it was my hap to haue out of the originall, of which, so much as concernes the subiect I here speake of: in the same Character: FOr as moche as it is wryttyn in the Epitaphe aboute the Tombe here present, of the high and myghty Prynce, Tho∣mas, late Duke of Norffolk after his discent from his noble antecessours, declared in the same in wrytyng, whyche is also set out in armes about the same Tombe. That who will se farther of the manner of his lyuyng and seruyce doon by hym to hys Pryncis; And of hys honorable depertyng out of this world, schall resorte and loke in thys Table. Fyrst you schall know the seid Duke was in hys yong age, after he had been a sufficient season at the gramer schole, Hencheman to Kyng Edward the iiii. and was than callyd Thomas Howard, Son and heire to Sir Iohn Howard Knight, after, Lord Howard, and after that, Duke of Norffolke of right enheritance; and the seid Thomas Howard whan he was at mannes age, was wyth dyuers other Gentlemen of Englond, sent to Charles, Duke of Burg n in the begynnyng of the warres betwixt Kynge Lewes of Fraunce, and the seid Duke Charles, and ther contynued vnto thende of the seid warres, to hys greate prayse and thankys. As well of Kyng Edward hys own souerayn Lord, as of the seid Duke Charles. And after the warres doon betwyxt the seid Kynge Lewes, and the seid Duke Charles, Than the seid Tho∣mas Howard returned in to Englond, vn to Kynge Edward hys souerayn Lord: And he made hym immedyatly Esquyer for his body. And he was aboute hym at hys makynge redy bothe eue∣nyng and mornyng. And afterward he made hym Knyghte at the maryage of the Duke of Yorke, Kynge Edward hys seconde son. And so he was with the seid Kynge Edward in all hys busynes, as∣well at Lyncolne Shire feld, & at the tyme of Banberyfeld, as at all other hys busynes And also at suche tyme as the same Kynge was takyn by the Erle of Warwyke at Warwyke befor hys escape and departynge in to Flaunders. And after the Kyngys depertynge in to Flaunders, for that the Coostis of Englond were so sett ffor depertynge of any other his seruauntis and frendis, the seid Thomas Howard was dryuyn of fforce to take Sayntwary of Seynt Ioannes in Colchester for the true seruyce he bare vn to Kynge Edward; and at the seid Kyngys retourne out of Flaunders, the seid Sir Thomas How∣ard resortyd vn to hym and went wyth hym to Barnet Feld, and ther was sore hurte. And after whan Kyng Edward went into Fraunce wyth hys Army Ryall, he sent thether before, dyuers gentylmen, And for that the seid Sir Thomas Howard had good experyence aswell in hys beynge wyth Charles Duke of Burgon, as in dyuers Feldys and busynesses witthe seid Kynge Edward, he had ther∣for Commaundement to go ouer wyth them, For his aduyse and counsell tyll the seyd Kynge came ouer, And whan Kyng Edward and Kyng Lewes mette at the Barriars vpon the Ryuer of Som, the seid Sir Thomas Howard was wyth kynge Edward at the Barriars by the kyngis commaundement and no mo Men saue only the Chaunceller of Englond, the Chaunceller of Fraunce, and Sir Iohn Cheney. And after the kyngis comyng home into Englond, the seid Sir Thomas Howard obteyned lycence of the kynge to lye in Norffolk at an howsse which he had in the righte of my Lady hys wyffe, cal∣led Asshewelthorpe, and ther he laye and kepte an honorable howsse, in the fauor of the hoole Shire, duryng the lyffe of the seid kynge Edward, and at that tyme and long after my Lord hys father was alyue. And after kynge Edward was ded, and kynge Edward the fyfte his Son; than kyng Rychard was kyng, And than the forseid Sir Thomas Howard was hys Subgette, And for that the yonge Duches of Norffolk whiche was very heire therunto, was ded withoute yssue; And the Lord Howard, Father to the seid Sir Thomas Howard, was rightefull heire to the same off former dis∣cent, was creatt Duke of Norffolk, and he creatt Erle of Surrey: And so they both serued the seid kynge Rychard truly as his Sub∣gettis durynge his lyff, lyeng at home in their owne Countries and kepyng honorable howsses. And they went with hym to Bos∣worthe felde, where the seid kynge Rychard was slayne, and also the seid Duke of Norffolk, And thafforseid Erle hurte, and takyn vpon the Feld, and put in the Tower of London, by kynge Henry the vii, and ther contynued thre yeerys and an halfe. In whiche tyme of his beyng in the Tower, the same kynge Henry had a felde wyth the Erle of Lyncolne in Notyngham Shire besydys Newarke, and the leeffetenant of the Tower came to the seid Erle, and proferred to hym the keyes to goo out at his ple∣sure; and he answered hym ageyne, that he wolde not deperte thens, vn to suche tyme as he that commaunded hym thether, shuld commaunde hym out ageyn, whiche was kynge Henry the vii. but charged the leffetenant vpon hys alligeaunce yf the kynge war on lyue to bryng hym ther, as the kynge was, to the tente he myght do his Grace seruyce, and after that for the true and feithfull seruyce that the seid kynge Henry herd of him doon to his other Prynce; and also that he sawe hymselfe, he dide on Bos∣worth feld, and for the grete preyse and truth that he herd of hym whills he was prisoner, and that he wold nat, thoughe he had li∣berty, come out of the Tower at the Erle of Lyncolnes feld, he toke hym out to his presence, and to be aboute his own person. And wythin x. wekes after hys comyng out of the Towre, ther was an Insurrection in the Northe by whom the Erle of Nor∣thombrelond was sleyne in the feld, and also the Citee of Yorke won e with a saw e by force; And for the subduyng of those Re∣bells, the kynge assembled a grete hoste of hys subgettis, and toke his iourney towards them from the Castell of Hertford; and the seid Erle of Surrey made chief captayn of his voward, and a∣poynted vnder him in the seid voward, the Erle of Shrewesbury, the Lord Hastyngs, Sir William Stanley, than beyng the kyngs Chambrelayn, Sir Rice ap Thomas, Sir Thomas Bowser, Sir Iohn Sauage, Sir Iohn Ryseley, and dyvers other, And whan this Iorney was doon the Capiteynes of these Rebelles, and many other of them were put to execucion, And for the syngu∣l r truste that the kynge had to the seid Erle, and the activyte that he saw in hym, he lefte hym in the North, and made hym hys Lyve enaunt generall from Trent Northward, and Warden of the Est and myddle Marches of Englond, ageynst Scotlond, and Iustice of the Forests from Trent Northward, and there he contynued x yeres; and kepte the countrey in peace with policy▪ and many paynes takyng withoute which yt wold nat have been, for that the countrey had ben so lately ponyss ed, and nat withoute desert, And thus he dide the hoole tyme of x yere, savyng in the se∣cond yere of his beyng, ther was an Insurrexion in the West part of the countrey with whome the seid Erle with the helpe of the kyngs true subgetts fought in the feld, and subdued them at Ak∣worth besides Pomfrett; And besides dyvers of them that were s ayne in the feld he toke the Capytaynes and put them to execu∣cion▪ and the residue he sued to the kyngs highnes for ther Par∣dones whiche he obteyned, and wanne therby the fauor of the countrey. And in the same yere the kyng went ouer the see, and laid seege to Bolayn, the seid Erle than remaynyng ther, not with∣stondyng that he was apoynted to have gone with the kyng, and h d gone▪ but for the lightnes of the pepule ther, wherfor he was left behynd both for the sauegard of the countrey, and for defen∣dyng of the Realme for the synguler truste that he had vnto hym. And sone after ther was warre with the Scottis, and for that the seid Erle wold be in a redynes to defende them, he went to Ann∣wyke, and ther laye to the defence of the borders: And in his own persone made a wynter Rood into Tyvydale, and ther brent ther howsses, and ther corne to the greatest losse and empouerysshement of the countrey, that was doon ther in an hundreth yere before; And after that, the kyng of Scott's in his owne person, and one Par yn with hym invaded this Realme of Englond, with a greatre power▪ and laid seege to Northam Castell. And assone as he erde that the seid Erle was comyng towardis hym he depert∣ed and fled into Scotlond with all the spede he myght. And in the same Somer after, the seid Erle made another Rood in to Scot∣lond, and laid seege to the Castell of Heyton, and dide race and pull downe the seid Castell, the kyng of Scottis with the puys∣saunce of his Realme lokyng vpon it; and the Erle had nat than past viii or ix thowsand men with hym. And than the kyng of Scottis sent vnto the seid Erle, Lyon his Herrold for to requyre batayle▪ which was graunted by the seid Erle, saying vnto the seid Herrold that forasmoche as he was an Officer of Armes sent from the kyng his Master to requyre bataile, and he Lyvetenaunt to the kyng his Master, graunted thervnto. And said it was a con∣tracte and a full bargayn whiche cowde not be brokyn, but in the defawte of oon of them. And promysed by the faith that he bare to God, and to Seynt George, and to the kyng his Master, he wold fulfill his promesse. And yf the kyng hys Master brake, yt shuld be asmoche to his dishonor and reproche as euer had Prynce. And whan the Harrold had herd this answere, and sawe weall the said Erle was clerely determined to fight; he said vnto hym, Sir the kyng my master sendeth you word, that for eschewyng of effusion of Gristen blode, he wilbe contented to fight with you hande to hande for the Towne of Berwike, and the Fisshegarthis on the West marches: yf he wynne you in bataile, and yf ye wynne hym in bataile you to have a kyngis Raunsom. Whervnto the said Erle made answere, that he thanked his Grace that he wolde put hym to so moche honour, that he beyng a kyng anoynted wold fight hande to hande with so poore a man as he, how be yt he seid he wold nat dysceyve his Grace, for he said though he wanne hym in in bataile, he was neuer the nerer Berwike, ner of Fisshegarthys, for, he had no suche comyssyon so to do: his Comyssyon was to do the kyng of Scottis his Master all the harme he coude, and so he had don, and wold do, &c. And bad hym shewe vnto the kyng hys Master that whan the Iorney was don, he wolde fyght wyth hym on Horsback or on fote at hys plesur, at any place he wold indif∣ferently appoynt, yf the kyng hys Master wold gyff hym leue, &c. And whan the warre was doon and ended witthe Scottis, and the North part of Englond in good reste and peace, than the kyngs Highnes sent for the seid Erle to be agayn about his parson, and made hym Tresourar of Englond, and of his priuye Counsayll. And after that the kyng sent hym into Scotland as chief Com myssyoner withe Lady Margarett hys doughter, to be maryed to the foresaid kyng of Scottis, whiche kyng att the tyme of the seid Erlys beyng ther, entreteyned hym as thankfully and fauourably as coude be thought. Notwithstondyng anye dyspleasures doon to hym by the seid Erle in the warres before. And also the seid kyng said than vn to hym, that he loued hym the better for suche servyce as he had doon before to the kyng his father kyng of Eng∣lond, thoughe the hurte war doon to hym, and to his Realme, and he gave to hym then at his depertyng greatt gyfts. And at the co∣myng home agayn of the seid Erle for the truste that the kyng our souerayn Lord had to hym, hys Grace made hym one of hys Exe∣cutours. And after the dethe of kyng Henry the vii, kyng Henry theyght made hym lyke wyse of hys prevay counsayll, and styll contynued Tresourer of Englond, and made hym highe Marshall of the same: And for the syngler truste that the kyng had aswell to his truthe, as to hys wysdome and actyvytte, at his goyng in to Fraunce with his puyssaunce, havyng with hys hyghnes the moste parte of his Nobles of this Realme, lefte the said Erle with a certeyn power in the Northe partys, and made hym Lyvete∣naunte generall from Trent Northward, to defend the Realme agaynste the kyng of Scottys, whom his hyghnes had no truste vnto for cause of the leeg betwyxt Fraunce and them: in case the s d kyng wold invade thys hys Realme, whiche he dide in deede, contrary to hys oth and promyse, with the hoole power of the Realme of Scotlond: Whiche when the seid Erle hard of, he made as greatt haste towardis hym as he coude with the kyngs power of the North partys. And toke hys lodgyng in the Campe or playn ca yd Wollar haugh in the Countie of Northumbrelond which was in the ight of the kyng of Scottis, and of all hys army then ying on Floddon hyll, a ground more lyke a campe or forteres, than any meete ground to gyve batayle on, contrary to hys pro∣mes made to Roge ras Purseuaunte at armys, before sent vnto hym from the seid Erle with message, that the said Erle with the Lord Howard then Admerall of Englond hys Son, And the no∣ men of the North partis, with other the kyngs Subgettis of the same North partis, was come thedir to represse and re∣siste hys Invasyons of hys souerayn Lordis Realme; desyryng the said kyng of Scottis to gyve hym bataile, which his message the same kyng of Scottis toke very thankfully and ioyusly, promysyng hym to abide ther on the same grounde, wher he than was; whiche hys promys he brake as is aforesaid, and tooke Floddon hil ys, a ground unprengnable, and shot at hym hys great Ordenaunce, where as he lay like one mynded to kepe it like a forteres, And whan the said Erle dide perceyve that he had brokyn hys promys, and takyn so stronge grounde as Floddon hillys, he than the said Erle remoued all his Batail vnto a playn besydis Barmer wood to thentente to get betwene hym and hys owne Realme of Scot∣lond, and ther leygeed but one nyght, and on the next mornyng to e hys passage ouer the water of at Twyfull forthe, and than he marched the said kyng and hys oste in suche maner, as he gat betwene hym and hys aune reame of Scotlond be force wherof the said kyng was fayn to leue his Campe, and to prepare hymself to bataile witthe seid Erle, on a hyll besydis Bramston in Northumbrelond very neer vnto Sandyford. Wher the said Erle witthe good assistauns of the Nobull men, and the power of the said North partys fought witthe said kyng and hym anqu sshed, and slewe in playn bataile derectely before his owne Standard. In which bataile ware slayne on the Scot∣tysshe parte ii Bysshoppes, xi E lys, xvii Barons, CCCC knyghtis besydys other Gentilmen, with xvii M in nombre, which ware nombred asweel by Scottysshe men as by them that dyd bury the moste parte of them. And of trouth dyvers Gentylmen and others aswell of the said Erlys servantys, as of the North partyes, and of Chesshir and Lankasshir war ther slayne, for hard it ys and half impossible in suche a conflicte and bataile to be wonne without losse of men, whoys deth may be ioyed among ther frendis to dye in so hygh a servys doon to ther Prynce. And this noble acte was don by the helpe of almyghty God to the highe honour of the kyngis hyghnes. Honor and prays to the said Erle and to all other Noble men, and otheres the kyngs Subgettis that war ther with hym at the bataile the ix daye of Septembir in the v yeer of our soue∣rayn Lord kyng Henry the viii. And this doon the said Erle went to Barwyke, to establysshe all thyngys well and in good order: And sent for the dede body of the kyng of Scottis to Barwyke, And whan the Ordenaunce of the kyng of Scottis was brouth of the feld, and put in good suer∣tie and all other thyngys in good order. Than the seid Erle toke hys Iorney toward Yorke, and ther abode duryng the kyngis plea∣sur, and caryed with hym the dede body of thafforesaid kyng of Scottis. And ther laye vnto suche tyme as the kyngis hygh es cam from beyond the See, after his wynnyng of Tyrwyn and Tomey. And than hys highnes sent for the seid Erle to mete hym at Rychemond▪ and so he dide, and ther delyvered vnto his high∣nes the dede body of the kyng of Scottis, whiche de bodye was delyuered in to the Charter hous ther, and ther to abide duryng the kyngs plesur. And for the servyce that the seid Erle dide, he was honorably restored vnto his right name of Duke of Norffolk, and also had ge∣uen vnto hym greatt possessyons by the kyngis highnes. And whan the warre betwixt the kyng our souerayn Lord and the Frenche Kyng was eended: than the said Duke was sent into Fraunce as chieff Commyssyoner with Lady Marye the Kyngis Suster, to be maryed vnto the Frenche Kyng Lewes. And after when the kyng and the Quene were both out of the Reame to mete witthe Frenche kyng Frauncys at Guynes, and the Prynces remaynyng in the Reame beyng a childe, the said Duke was left behynde as protector and defender to mynyster Iu∣stice, and to see good Rule and Gouernaunce in the Reame, in the absence of the kyngis highnes, and so contynued aboute the kyng, and of his preuye Counsayle tyll he w s of age of fourescore yeeris, and then the kyngis highnes was content that the said Duke shulde go home, in to hys owne countrey vnto the Castell of Fram∣lyngham, wher he contynued and kepte an honorable howse vnto the houre of his deth. And ther he dyed lyke a good Cristen Prynce I now to wytnes. Whose sowle Iesu pardon. And at his depertyng out of Framlyngham Castell toward hys buryall he coude nat be asked one grote for his dette, nor for resti∣tucion to any person, and so was had to this present Abbay of Thetford with moche honor; Accompanyed with many greatt Lordis, and the Noble men of both Schires of Norffolk and Suffolk. Leuyng then lyuyng these his children herafter named; that is to seye, his son and heyre the Lord Thomas Duke of Norffolk, the Lord Edmond Howard, the Lord Willyam Howard, and the Lord Thomas Howard, witthe Ladye Elysabeth wiffe to the Ui∣count Rocheford: the Lady Agnes Countes of Oxenford, the La∣dy Kateryne espoused to the heyre of Sir Rice app Thomas of Wa∣lys: the Lady Elysabeth espoused vnto the Uicount Fitzwaters son and heyr. And the Lady Dorathie then beyng not maryed, but lefte for hir Right, good substance to marry hyrwyth. Henry Fitz Roy Duke of Rich∣mond. Henry Fitz-Roy the naturall sonne of King Henry the eight (begotten of the Lady Talboys, daughter of Sir Iohn Blount knight) Duke of Rich∣mond was here interred, as Graston, Stow, Hollinshed, and other writers affirme: howsoeuer some will haue him to bee buried at Framingham in Suffolke. Hee married Mary daughter of the foreremembred Thomas Ho∣ward Duke of Norfolke, Earle Marshall, and Lord high Treasurer of Eng∣land, with whom he liued not long, but dyed at Saint Iames by Westmin∣ster the 22. of Iuly, in the yeare of Christ Iesus, 1536. He was a Prince very forward in Martiall actiuities, of good literature and knowledge in the tongues; vnto whom the learned Antiquarie Leland dedicated a booke; as appeareth by this Hexastichon following, which is to be found amongst the said Lelands written Epigrams. Ad illustrissimum Henricum Ducem Richmontanum. Quo Romana modo maiuscula littera pingi, Pingi quo possit littera parua modo, Hic liber ecce tibi signis monstrabit apertis Princeps, Aonij sp s et alumne gregis: Qui tibi si placeat (quod certe spero futurum) Maxima proparuo munere dona dabis. Now for that I haue here found such ample relation of the worthy at∣chieuements of the Howards, I will goe forwards with that illustrious fami∣ly as I finde them in this tract, either intombed or otherwise remembred in Churches. Middleton. Although no Subscription now remaineth vnder this portraiture, yet by the impalement of the Armes of Howard, and Scales on the side thereof, it is manifest that this was made for Robert Lord Scales, whose daughter and Co-heire Margaret, was married vnto Sir Robert Howard, Knight, eldest sonne of Sir Iohn Howard, Knight, who in the one and twentieth of Ed∣ward the Third, was made Admirall ab ore Aquae Thamesis versus partes Boriales quamdiu Regi placuerit. And this Sir Robert was great Grandfa∣ther to Iohn Howard Duke of Norfolke. East Winch. On the South side of the Chancell of East-Winch Church, is an ancient Chappell, called Howards Chappell, in which are these Monuments fol∣lowing. In the South Wall of the said Chappell, this enarched Monument, as it is here set forth, diuers of the Escocheons being decaied (which are left blanke) and onely this inscription now remaining thereon. ..... anima∣bus Domini Roberti Howard militis et Margerie vxoris sue ..... On the Pauement of the said Chappell, be these two stones as they are here defigured, whose inscriptions through time are decayed, or rather stolne away by some sacrilegious persons, a crime (as I haue said elsewhere) too frequent, and too little punished; but without doubt these Monuments were here placed for some of the Ancestors of this most honourable family, this being their peculiar Chappell and place of Buriall. In the East Window of the foresaid Chappell, this ancient effigies of late was perfectly to be seene, (the portraiture of the same being exactly ta∣ken by the learned Gent. Sir Henry Spelman, the memory thereof (as of diuers other Monuments) an by him preserued) in relation to which, this worthy Knight writ these verses. Creditur has sacris candentem ardoribus aedes, (Quas dicat hic supplex) instituisse Deo. This ancient Chappell of the Howards, hath of late yeeres beene most irreligiously defaced by vncouering the same; taking off the Lead, and com∣mitting it to sale, whereby these ancient Monuments haue layne open to ruine: But now in repairing by the order of the most Honourable preser∣uer of Antiquities (as well in generall, as in his owne particular) Thomas Earle of Arundell and Surrey, Earle Marshall of England, and the Chiefe of that most Honourable family. To this I also offer in obseruation, both that the Posture, fashion of the Armour, and coate of Armes (wherwith it is habited) denotes great anti∣quitie: and it should seeme by the Banner-fashiond Shield, that this was the portraiture of some Banneret, Ancestor of this Illustrious family; for that Banners, and the manner of this bearing of Armes was onely proper to Bannerets, Knights of the Garter, Barons, and higher nobility. In this Church of East Winch is a very faire Font of ancient times, e∣rected by some of this family, as appeareth by their Armes being disposed in diuers places of the same; the which for the curiosity of the work, consi∣dering the antiquity, giues me occasion here to present the true forme of one part thereof vnto your view. Weeting. In the South Window of the Church of Weeting S. Maries, is this portraiture following, the which by the Armes doth seeme to be the picture of Sir Iohn Howard Knight, made in the time that he was married to Mar∣garet, the daughter and heire of Sir Iohn Plays. Farsfield. In the East Window of the South part of this Church, is the resem∣blance of one of the most noble Family of the Howards, as appeareth by his Coate of Armes; but the subscription being wanting, obscures the meanes to discouer which of them he was. Framlingham. Howsoeuer this Towne stands in Suffolke, yet (I hope) it comes not in impertinently in this place. Vnder a goodly rich Monument in this Pa∣rish Church lye interred the honourable remaines of Henry Howard Earle of Surrey, and knight of the Garter, the sonne of Thomas Duke of Norfolke, as also of Frances his wife, the daughter of Iohn Vere Earle of Oxford, as appeares by the Inscription thereupon engrauen, as followeth. Henry Howard Earle of Surrey and Frances his wife.

Camd. in Norf. This Henry Earle of Surrey, saith Camden, was the first of our English Nobilitie, that did illustrate his high birth with the beauty of learning, and his learning with the knowledge of diuers languages, which hee attained vnto by his trauells into forraine Nations. Pit. de illust. Ang. scriptoribus pag. 923. He was a man, elegantis ingenij politaeque doctrinae, saith Pitseus. He writ diuers workes both diuine and humane; he was exquisite as well in Latine as in English verse. Of his Eng∣lish take this Essay, being an Epitaph which he made to the memory of Sir Anthony Denny Knight, a Gentleman whom King Henry the eight great∣ly affected. Vpon the death of Sir Anthony Denny. Hen. How. Poem. Death and the King did, as it were, contend Sir Anthony Denny. Which of them two bare Denny greatest loue: The King to shew his loue gan farre extend: Did him aduance his betters farre aboue: Nere place, much wealth, great honour eke him gaue, To make it knowne what power great Princes haue. But when death came with his triumphant gift, From worldly carke he quit his wearied ghost, Free from the corpes, and straight to heauen it lift. Now deme that can who did for Denny most; The King gaue welth, but fading and vnsure, Death brought him blisse that euer shall endure. Leland our English Antiquary speaking much in the praise of Sir Tho∣mas Wiat the elder, as well for his learning as other his excellent qualities meete for a man of his calling; calls this Nobleman, the conscript enrolled heire of the said Sir Thomas Wiat, being one delighted in the like Studies with the said Sir Thomas Wiat. As it is in his Naeniae or Funerall Songs as followeth. Le and n suis N ij . Bella suum meritò iactet Florentia Dantem, Regia Petrarchae carmina Roma probet.

This Sir Thomas Wiat, the Translatour of Dauids Psalmes into English, died of the pestilence in the West countrey, The death of Sir Tho. Wiat. being on his iourney into Spaine, whither he was sent Embassadour from the King vnto the Empe∣rour, in the yeare 1541. But to returne, this Earle had, together with his learning, wisedome, for∣titude, munificence, and affabilitie; yet all these good and excellent parts were no protections against the Kings displeasure. For, vpon the twelfth of December, Annal. Stow. Hollin Hali. Speed. H . the last of King Henry the eight, he with his Father Thomas Duke of Norfolke, vpon certaine surmises of Treason, were committed to the Tower of London, the one by water, the other by land, so that the one knew not of the others apprehension; The fifteenth day of Ianuary next following, hee was arraigned at Guild Hall London, where the greatest matter alledged against him, was, for bearing certaine Armes, that were said belonged to the King and Prince; the bearing whereof hee iustified. To be short (for so they were with him) hee was found guilty by twelue common Iuriars, had iudgement of death, and vpon the nineteenth day of the same moneth (nine dayes before the death of the said King Henry the eight) was beheaded at Tower Hill. He was first interred in the Chappell of the Tower, and afterwards, viz. in the raigne of our late drad Soueraigne King Iames, of famous memory, his remainders of ashes and bones were remoued to this place, by his second sonne Henry Earle of Northampton: as appeares by the foresaid Inscription. Many more goodly Tombes and Grauestones (but without Inscripti∣ons) are in this Church, made for the remembrance of this Heroicall Pro∣genie of the Howards and their Matches (who haue here a faire and beauti∣full Castle, fortified with a banke, ditch, and walls of great thicknesse; wherein are thirteene Towers, inwardly furnished with buildings right commodious and necessarie) the resemblances and figures whereof had been cut and deline ted, if the hastinesse of the Presse would haue permitted. Of this surname of Howard, thus Verstegan writes, in his treatise, Of our ancient English Titles of Honour, Dignities, and Offices. And of the word Holdward. This ancient and honourable name of Office, saith he, hath receiued the in ury of time, . which hath worne it out of vse and memory. The l and d, being for easinesse of sound omitted in the pronunciation (as in sundrie other words the like is seene) it became of Holdward which signifieth the gouernour or keeper of a Castle, fort, or hold of warre, to be Howard. Which name of Office albeit we haue long since lost, yet retaineth our Realme, to the high honour and illustrious ornament thereof, the great and gh noble familie vnto whom it is now the surname, and it is like that at first it so became to be, vpon the bearing of such a warlike honourable Of∣fice and charge.

Glanuill, and seated on the sharpe top of an hill, the crosse whereof our ancestors had in holy reuerence, I know not for what miracles. Thomas Rudhorne, Bishop of S. Dauids, who flourished in the raigne of Henry the fourth, hath (in his history) these words to the same effect. The holy Crosse of Bromholme. Capulanus quidam portauit quandam crucem ligneam in Angliam, quam affirmauit esse de ligno in quo pependit Christus et Monachis de Bromholme ob ulit et postea locus coruscabat miraculis. A certaine Priest, brought ouer with him, saith he, a woodden Crosse into England, which he affirmed to be the Crosse whereupon our Sauiour Christ was crucified; which he deliuered to the Monkes of Bromholme, after which the place did shine gloriously with miracles. Capgraue in the life of S. Ed∣ d King and . But the story of this holy Crosse is more fully deliuered by Capgraue on this manner. Saint Helene, saith he, hauing found the Crosse, did diuide it into nine parts, according to the nine Orders of the Angels: of one part thereof (which was most besprinckled with Christs bloud, his hands and feete being thereto nailed) she made a little crosse, which she inclosed in a boxe of gold, beset with precious stones, and gaue it to her sonne Constan∣tine the Emperour, which went successiuely from one Emperour to ano∣ther, vntill it came to Baldwin, who kept a Chaplaine to say daily masse before this sacred Relique; the said Chaplaine being dead, one Hugh a Priest, borne here in Norfolke, was preferred to his place. Baldwin, so long as he carried this Crosse with him to battaile, had euer the vpper hand of his enemies, but forgetting it, hee was forthwith slaine, vpon which his Chaplaine Hugh stole secretly away with the said Boxe and Crosse, came to this Monastery of Bromholme, and bestowed them both here vpon the Monkes, for which so inestimable a gift, he with his two sonnes (which he had by his wife before he entred into holy orders) were kept of the Monkes with all things necessary, vntill the death of Hugh the father, and the pre∣ferment of both his sonnes. By the vertue of this holy Crosse, Cooperante Domino, God assisting, thirty and nine persons, were raised from death to life; and ninteene which were blinde, receiued their sight, besides many o∣ther miracles which it wrought, if you will beleeue my Author. com∣pertorum. Hic apparuit multa superstitio circa crucem quae vocatur, the holy Crosse of Bromholme, et dicunt illic se habere Zonam beate marie et lac eiusdem, et fragmenta crucis sancti petri et sancte Andree, saith a booke in the treasury of the Exchequer of the visitation of Abbeys. Here appeareth great superstition about a Crosse, which is called the Ho∣ly Crosse of Bromholme; and here they say they haue the girdle and milke of the blessed Virgin, and a fragment of the Crosse of Saint Peter, and of Saint Andrew. I finde that the Founder G. Glanuill, was here buried. A name, as you may reade in that which I haue already written, of great account for many ages in diuers parts of this kingdome. There be of the later writer, saith Camden, speaking of the Earles of Suf∣folke, who report, Camd. that the Glanuils in times past, were honoured with this title; But seeing they ground vpon no certaine authoritie, where as men may easily mistake, and I haue found nothing of them in the publike re∣cords of the kingdome, they must pardon me if I beleeue them not, vntill they produce more certainty, yet the meane while I confesse, that the Fa∣milie of the Glanuils in this tract, was of right good note, and high repu∣tation.

One Richold a Widdow, The foundati∣on of the Chappell and Priory at Wal∣singham, out of a increasing Li∣brarie of Sir dwelling in the Towne of Walsingsame, was the first founder of the Chappell there in the yeare of our Lord God, 1061. which she dedicated to our blessed Lady, and founded the same in all points, like to the Chappell of our Lady at Nazareth, in that place where she was saluted by the Angell Gabriel. It was made a Priory of blacke Ca∣nons, by Edmond Earle of March, and Elisabeth de Burgo, in the raigne of Edward the Third; and valued at the suppression thereof, (which happe∣ned the fourth of August, in the thirtieth yeare of the raign of K. Henry the Eight) after the rate of those times, to haue of yearely reuenues, foure hun∣dred forty sixe pounds, fourteene shillings, foure pence, halfe penny, qua. Camd. in Norf. This village was much renowned throughout all England for a Pilgri∣mage to our Lady, the Virgin Mary: whom he who had not in that former age visited, and presented with offerings, was reputed irreligious. But this shall Erasmus, an eye witnesse, describe in his owne very words. Erasmus of the pilgrimage to W lsingham. Not farre from the Sea, saith he, about foure miles, there standeth a Town, liuing almost of nothing else but vpon the resort of Pilgrimes. There is a Col∣ledge of Canons, yet such, as vnto whom the Latinists haue giuen the addition of Regulares; a middle kinde, betwixt Monkes and those Canons, whom they terme Secular: This Colledge hath scarse any other reuenues, than from the liberality of the said Virgin. For, certaine of the greater Presents and Obla∣tions are laid vp and preserued. But if there be any money offered, or ought else, of small value, that goeth vnto maintenance of the Couent, and their Head or President, whom they call Prior. The Church is faire and neat: yet in it the Virgin dwelleth not: that honour, forsooth, shee hath done vnto her Sonne: she hath her Church by her selfe, but so, as that she may be on the right hand of her Sonne. Neither doth she dwell here for all this, for why, the buil∣ding is not yet finished, and the place hath a through light and ayre on all sides, with open dores, and wide open windowes; the Ocean Sea withall the fa∣ther and foster of all winds is hard by. In that Church which I said was vnfi∣nished, there is a small Chappell, but all of wood, whereunto on either side at a narrow and little dore, are such admitted, as come with their deuotions and offerings. Small light there is in it, and none other in manner, but by Tapers or waxe Candles, yeelding a most deynty and pleasant smell. Nay, if you looke into it, you would say it were the habitation of heauenly Saints indeed; so bright shining it is all ouer with precious stones, with gold and siluer. But within the memory of our fathers, saith Camden in the same place, when King Henry the eight had set his minde and eye both, vpon the ri∣ches and possessions of Churches, all this vanished quite away. Rising Castle. So denominated of a Castle sometime there standing, (the seat anciently of the Albineys, the Monthaults, and the Mowbrays ) which now after long languishing, as it were, by reason of old age, hath giuen vp the ghost. In the Porch of this Parish Church, is a Grauestone, vnder which, say the inhabitants (which I haue heard sworne by others) Isabell, Queene of England, the wife of Edward the Second, lieth interred; vpon the Graue∣stone, are two words onely remaining, which make the country people so thinke of the matter, Queene Isa∣bels seruant. which are .... Isabelle Regine .... now by these, the case is made plaine, to any than can distinguish between the Cases No∣minatiue, and Genitiue, that this stone was laid to perpetuate the remem∣brance of some one of that Queenes seruants.

So called of a smooth plaine or Common thereunto adioyning, some two miles in extensure: Pinguis adeo & luxurians vt Paduana pascua vi∣deatur superasse: So abundantly fertile, that in fatnesse of soile it doth ex∣ceed the pastures about Padua in Italy. For, it serues, and that sufficiently, for the grazing of all the greater sort of cattell of seuen Towneships, to the same neare scituated, besides the feeding of thirtie thousand sheepe. In the Churchyard is a ridg'd Altar, Tombe or Sepulchre of a wondrous antique fashion, vpon which an Axell-tree and a cart-wheele are insculped; Vnder this Funerall Monument, the Towne-dwellers say that one Hiki∣fricke lies interred; of whom (as it hath gone by tradition from Father to the Sonne) they thus likewise report: he story of Hikifrick, here How that vpon a time (no man knowes how long since) there happened a great quarrell betwixt the Lord of this land or ground, and the Inhabitants of the foresaid seuen villages, about the meere-markes, limits, or bondaries of this fruitfull feeding place; the matter came to a battell or skirmish, in which the said Inhabitants being not able to resist the Landlord and his forces, began to giue backe; Hiki∣fricke, driuing his cart along, and perceiuing that his neighbours were faint-hearted, and ready to take flight, he shooke the Axell-tree from the cart, which he vsed in stead of a sword, The strange & of and tooke one of the cart-wheeles which he held as a buckler; with these weapons (in a furious rage, you must ima∣gine) he set vpon the Common aduersaries, or aduersaries of the Common, encouraged his neighbours to go forward, and fight valiantly in defence of their liberties; who being animated by his manly prowesse, they tooke heart to grasse, as the prouerbe is, insomuch that they chased the Landlord and his companie, to the vtmost verge of the said Common; which from that time they haue quietly enioyed to this very day. The Axell-tree and cart-wheele are cut and figured in diuers places of the Church, and Church windowes, which makes the story, you must needs say, more probable. . This relation doth in many parts parallell with that of one Hay, a strong braue spirited Scottish Plowman, who vpon a set battell of Scots against the Danes, being working at the same time in the next field, and seeing some of his countreymen to flie from that hote encounter, caught vp an oxe yoke, ( Boethius saith, a Plough-beame) with which (after some exhor∣tation that they should not bee faint-hearted) hee beate the said straglers backe againe to the maine Army, where he with his two sonnes (who tooke likewise such weapons as came next to their hands) renewed the charge so furiously that they quite discomfited the enemy, obtaining the glory of the day and victory, for their drad Lord and Soueraigne Kenneth the third, King of Scotland: and this happened in the yeare 942. the second of the said kings raigne. This you may reade at large in the History of Scotland, thus abridged by Camden as followeth. Where Tay now growen bigger enlargeth himselfe (saith he) there ap∣peareth ouer it Arrol, Cam . in Perth Hay s. Earles of Arrol or E tol. the habitation of the noble Earles of Arrol, who euer since the Bruises dayes, haue beene by inheritance the Constables of Scotland: and verily they deduce an ancient pedegree from one Hay, a man of exceeding strength and excellent courage: who together with his two sonnes, in a dangerous battell of Scots against the Danes at Longcarty, caught vp an oxe yoke, and so valiantly and fortunately withall, what with frighting, and what with exhorting, reenforced the Scots at the point to shrinke and recule, that they had the day of the Danes, and the King with the States of the kingdome ascribed the victory and their owne safety vnto his valour and prowesse. Whereupon in this place, the most battle and fruitfull grounds were assigned vnto him and his heires, who in testimony hereof, haue set ouer their coat a yoke for their Creast. Of which memorable exploite, to the further honour of this ancient and Princely great Family, Iohn Ionston of Aberdon, that ingenious learned Diuine and Poet hath written, as followeth.

The Succession, names and number of the right reuerend Fathers in God, Lords and Bishops of Dunwich, Elmham, and Norwich, and of such of them as I finde to haue beene reputed Saints. OF the Bishops of Dunwich and Elmham, I haue already written; of which number, Felix the first Bishop was the first Saint. In the yere vi. hundreth thyrty and two . Kynge Edwyne, by holy doctryne, Of Saynt Felix, an holy Preste that was tho, And preachyng of the holy archbyshop Paulyn, Of Chrystes worde, and verteous discyplyne Conuerted Edordwolde, of Estangle the kyng, And all the realme, where Felix was dwelling. a gra e in vi confesso∣ria. This sacred Bishop Felix was borne, brought vp, and sublimated with an Episcopall Mitre, in the parts of Burgundy; which worldly pompe and honour, together with his owne Countrie, hee forsooke, onely to propa∣gate the Gospell, and came into England to preach the word of God, in the daies of Honorius Bishop of Rome, Honorius being as then Archbishop of Canterbury. He was a man euery way learned, & what he daily taught, hee carefully put in practise by his holy conuersation, and charitable good workes. He deliuered the word with great mildnesse and pleasant elocuti∣on, whereby the more easily he subiugated his Auditors to the yoke of esus Christ. Hauing gouerned the East Angles 17 yeares, he died at Dun∣wich, his Seat, S. . his places. the eight of the Ides of March, Anno 647. where in the Church of his owne Foundation, he was first buried; but after a time, his bones were taken vp and conuaied to Some in Cambridgeshire, and there solemnly encoffined in the Chancell of the Church there, which hee like∣wise built. And afterwards, in the raigne of King Canute, his sacred re∣liques were remoued from thence to the Abbey-Church of Ramsey in Huntingdonshire, by the procurement of Ethelstan, at that time Abbot of the said Monastery. The next Bishop that I finde, was Humbyrct, or Humbert, who kept his See at Elmham, . and being reputed holy, was reckoned for a Saint, of which a late writer. . The See at Norwich, now establisht (long not stird) At Eltham planted first, to Norwich then transferd, Into our bed-roule here, her Humbert in doth bring, (A Counsellour that was to that most martyred king Saint Edmund ) who in their rude massacre then slaine, The title of a Saint, his Martyrdome doth gaine. Now to come to Norwich, the first Bishop of Norwich was William Herbert : the second, Euerard: the third, William Turbus : the fourth, Iohn of Oxford: the fift, Iohn de Grey: of these I haue written before. The sixt, was Pandulfus, the Popes Legate, hee was consecrated at Rome, by Honorius the Third, Bishop of Rome, and died the fift yeare of his consecration, 1227. The seuenth was Thomas de Blundeuill, an officer of the Exchequer, preferred thereunto by Hubert de Burgo, the famous chiefe Iustice of En∣gland: he died, August 16. 1236. The eight, Radulph, who died, An. 1236. The ninth was William de Raleigh, who was remoued to Winchester. The tenth was Walter de Sufield ; the eleuenth, Simon de Wanton ; the twelfth, Roger de Sherwyng ; the thirteenth, William Middleton, of whom before. The fourteenth was Raph de Walpoole, translated to Ely. The fifteenth was Iohn Salmon ; the sixteenth was William Ayermin, of whom before. The seuenteenth was Antony de Becke, Doctor of Diuinitie, a retainer to the Court of Rome, Godwin de presul. Aug. and made Bishop by the Popes Prouisorie Bull. Hee had much to doe with the Monkes of his Church, whom it seemeth hee v∣sed too rigorously. He also withstood Robert Winchelsey, Archbishop of Canterbury, in his visitation, appealing from him to Rome. This boiste∣rous vnquiet humour, it seemes, was his death; for it is said, that hee was poisoned by his owne seruants. The eighteenth Bishop was William Bateman, who died at Auinion, in the yeare 1354. and was there buried, of whom hereafter. The ninteenth was Thomas Piercy: The twentieth was Henry Spencer : The one and twentieth was Alexander, of whom before. The two and twentieth was Richard Courtney, Chancellour of the Vni∣uersitie of Oxford, a man famous for his excellent knowledge in both lawes. A man of great linage, great learning, and great vertue, and no lesse beloued among the common people. He died of a Fluxe in Normandy, at the siege of Harflew, Septemb. 14. 1415. in the second yeare after his con∣secration. His body being brought into England, was honourably interred at Westminster. The three and twentieth, was Iohn Wakering, of whom I haue spoken before. The foure and twentieth was William Alnwick, translated to Lincolne, of whom hereafter in his place of buriall. The fiue and twentieth was Thomas Browne, Bishop of Rochester, who being at the Councell of Basill, had this Bishopricke cast vpon him, before euer he vnderstood of any such intent toward him. In his time, the Citizens of Norwich (vpon an old grudge) attempted many things against the Church: but such was the singuler wisedome and courage of this Bishop, that all their enterprises came to none effect; he sate nine yeares, and died anno 1445. where buried, I doe not finde. The sixe and twentieth was Gualter Hart, or Lyghart. The seauen and twentieth was Iames Goldwell. The eight and twentieth was Thomas Ian. The nine and twentieth was Richard Nyx, of whom before. The thirtieth, was William Rugge, alias Reps, a Doctor of Diuinitie in Cambridge. He sate 14 yeares, and deceased anno 1550. The one and thirtieth was Thyrlhey, a Doctor of Law of Cambridge, the first and last Bishop of Westminster, translated to Ely. The two and thirtieth was Iohn Hopton, a Doctor of Diuinity of Oxford, and houshold Chaplaine to Queene Mary, elected to this Bishopricke in King Edwards daies. He sate 4 yeares, and died in the same yeare that Queene Mary did, for griefe as it was supposed. The three and thirtieth, was Iohn Parkhurst, who lieth buried in his Cathedrall Church, vnder a faire Tombe, with this Inscription. Iohannes Parkhurstus Theol. professor, Gilford: natus, Oxon. educatus. Temporibus Mariae Reginae pro tuenda conscientia vixit exul voluntarius: postea Presul factus sanctissime hanc rexit Ecclesiam, per. 16. An. ob. 1574. aetat 63. Vivo bono, docto, ac pio Iohanni Parkhursto Episcopo vigilentissimo, Geor∣gius Gardmer posuit hoc monumentum. The foure and thirtieth was Edmund Freake, Doctor of Diuinity, who was remoued from hence to Worcester. The fiue and thirtieth was Edmund Scambler, houshold Chaplaine for a time to the Archbishop of Canterbury: hee was consecrated Bishop of Peterborough, Ianuary 16. anno 1560. and vpon the translation of Bishop Freake, preferred to this See, where hee lieth buried vnder a faire monu∣ment, hauing this Inscription or Epitaph. Edmundi Scambleri, viri reuerendissimi, et in ampliss. dignitatis gradu dum inter homines ageret locati corpus in hoc tegitur tumulo, obijt Non. Maij anno 1594. Viuo tibi, moriorque tibi, tibi Christe resurgam, Te quia iustifica Christe prebendo fide. Huic abeat mortis terror, tibi viuo redemptor, Mors mihi lucrum est, tu pie Christe salus. The sixe and thirtieth was William Redman, Archdeacon of Canterbu∣ry, consecrated Ianuary 12. an. 1594. He was sometime fellow of Trinity Colledge in Cambridge, and bestowed 100. markes vpon wainscotting of the Library there. Hee died a few daies before Michaelmas, Anno 1602. The seauen and thirtieth, was Iohn Iegon, Doctor of Diuinity, and Deane of Norwich, fellow sometimes of Queenes Colledge in Cambridge, and afterwards master of Bennet Colledge: of the time of his death, or how long he enioyed this high dignitie, I haue not learned. The eight and thirtieth was Iohn Ouerall Doctor of Diuinitie, some∣times Fellow of Trinitie Colledge, Master of Katherine Hall, and the Kings Professor in Cambridge; afterwards, Deane of S. Pauls, a learned great Schooleman, as any was in all the kingdome: how long hee sate, or when he died, I doe not certainly know. Samuel Harsenet, Doctor of Diuinity, sometime Master of Penbroke Hall in Cambridge, Bishop of Chichester, and now graced with the me∣tropoliticall dignity of the Archbishoprick of Yorke, was the nine and thir∣tieth Bishop of this Diocesse. Which at this time is gouerned by the right reuerend Father in God; Francis White, Doctor of Diuinitie, the Kings Almone , sometimes Deane, as also Bishop of Carlile, an excellent learned man, as his workes now extant doe testifie. Now it here followes that I should say somewhat of the scituation, cir∣cuit, commodities, and other particulars of this Diocesse, like as I haue done of London, but that is already most exactly performed, and to the full, by that learned and iudicious Knight, and great Antiquary, Sir Hen∣ry Spelman, in his booke (before mentioned) called Icenia: a Manuscript much desired to come to the open view of the world. Here endeth the Ancient Funerall Monuments within the Diocesse of Norwich; and this Booke. FINIS.
