THE HART
CONSECRATED
to the loue of IESVS.

THE HYMNE.
IESV, behold the hart dilates
It-selfe to thee, and consecrates
It's triple power, and al within.
But oh! that heauy burden, sinne,
Drawes to the earth, and makes it fal
From high aspiring thoughts. Not al,
Who now support, giue it repose;
Thou art the Atlas, here enclose
Thy selfe within the hart, giue rest
To it, which otherwise opprest,
With the heauy load, the world, sinks down.
Make it despise (to gaine a crowne)
The earth, it's Nathir, and with thee
It's Zenith make Eternity.



THE INCENTIVE.
1. WHere our treasure is, there is
our hartLuc 12.. IESVS is a treasure,
wherin our hopes, our riches,
and al we haue, are lodged and laid vp
in store. Where then shal we better
place the hart, then in the hart, the
Reliquary of the diuinity it-self, at
IESVS feet, the most sure Altar of
the miserable, in his hands, the
richest Magazin of al graces?
2. Loe here a hart burning al with
loue, how many and what flames it
sends forth like a furnace. Happy and
thrice happy he, who, but for Heauen,
hath no loue, no hart at al!
3. Goe to then, al you pious and
sincere harts, come and consecrate
your selues to the honour and loue
of IESVS. For to whom better?
since what we pay to him we allow

our selues; and what we take from
him we quite forgoe and loose for
euer.


THE PREAMBLE TO THE
first Meditation.
WHo shal seuer vs from the charity
of Christ? (exclaymes that
great Apostle) tribulation? or distresse?
or famine? or nakednesse? peril? persecution?
or the sword? Sure I am, that
death, nor life, nor Angels, nor Principa^es,
nor vertues, nor present, nor future
things, nor fortitude, altitude, nor depth,
nor any other creature, can seperate vs
from the charity of God, which is in
Christ IESVSRom. 8.. This is the fire,
which gliding from heauen consumes
al things, burnes al things; yea
enkindles such flames as euen the
Ocean of euils, wherewith the

flowes, and aboundes, c^a not quenchit.
This subtil, actiue, spreading,
and deuouring flame, takes force and
vigour euen from very crosses and
torments themselues, surmounts al
things, cleaues to one God, and with
an inextricable knot is vnited with
him. Whether it be the fire, which
alwayes suffers some-what, or actuates
this or that, I know not; this I am
sure of, that the liuelyer it puts forth
the force it hath, the lesse it yealds to
the enemy, and is the hardlyer ouercome.
This fire, when once it takes
on the litle furnace of the hart, good
God! what strange, and how many
heates, of loue enkindles it there!
They only know the excesses of
this vnquiet feauer, who loue IESVS
dearely indeed, and passionately thirst
after him.
Now shal you see this languishing
hart breake out into frequent, abrupt,

and interrupting sighs, and
now and then heare certayne briefe
interiections withal, cast forth here
and there by the poore soule, liquefying
with a sweet extasy of loue:
Tel my beloued, o blessed spirits, that
I languish al for loueCant. 5. and that vnles
with the prop of his golden
scepter he come, as once Ass^erus to
HesterEster 15. and powerfully susteyne and
hold vp my fleeting soule, I shal
faint at his feet: for now the vnequal
and feeble pulse euen mortally
beates, and now my face is fouly
dight with an asky and deadly colour,
the extatical heat now wholy
wastes the marrow, so as now remaynes
in me nothing which suffers
not of this fire.
But anon you wil wonder to see
that hart excited with the same loue
of God, resuming as it were new
strength, to be sodainly caryed and

snacht with violence into the thing
beloued. I wil rise, said the Spouse
extreamly enamoured with her beloued,
I wil compasse the Citty, through
streets and lanes, I wil seeke whom my
soule louesCant. 3.; nor wil I giue ouer til
obteyning my desire I take hold of
him. I wil enquire of created things,
and aske them, where is my God? I wil
seeke and perticularly demand of al;
nor wil I truely rest satisfyed finding
some image only of God in them superficially
shadowed, or discouering
but a glimmer only of diuine perfections,
for these wil but excite my
thirst, not quenh it wholy; but I wil
hunt further and constantly seeke
him, whom my soules louesCant. 1.. For
the hart enflamed with loue, continually
machinates and workes something;
nor hath diuine loue learned
to be idle: it is alwayes in action,
and stil proceedes from vertue to

vertue, and if it rest at any tyme,
and seeme but to sabothize, it is no
longer diuine loueGreg. Hom. 30. in Euang..
Amidst these symptomes of this
disease, the mind obteynes three
things, and proues them in it-selfe:
for first, how much soeuer it occupyes
it-self in difficult things, and
seriously attends, to its owne abasement,
to a perfect cont^ept of worldly
things, to represse vntamed and
vnbridled appetites, yet al these acts,
most worthy and heroical, it puts in
the last place, yea when it workes
and effects the most, thinks it hath
done as good as nothing, and
lastly accounts the tyme so long
spent in the lists of vertue to be exceeding
short, which euen the sacred
Scriptures record of the Patriarch
Iacob, whom the beauty and loue of
the faire Rachel had so taken and enveigled,
as he reckoned yeares very

tedious for toyles, as weekes for
dayes, dayes for momentsGen. 29.. I haue
yet said but litle: The hart which is
enamoured with IESVS, thinks it
cannot be broken or tamed with
anything, and therefore dares prouoke
euen death it-self, and chalenge
it to a single fight, as not his match,
to scorne its weapons, and not so
only, but insolently to insult vpon
this pale Goddesse, who yet is she
which tramples the Crownes and
Scepters of Kings and Caesars, subdues
the armed Sampsons and layes
them at her foot, forbids the Alexanders,
not satisfyed with one world,
to spread their Ensignes any further;
lastly, puts the Hel^n^^s, as deformed,
vnder a base yoke. What more? This
hart is so impatient of rest, delayes,
al things, as while most ardently it
loues and seekes the onelie IESVS,
and groanes after him, it holds a moment

for a yeare, regards not any
thing els, nothing likes, nothing
pleaseth, nothing satiates or recreates
a whit, as to whom, besides IESVS,
al things are nauseous and but dreames
vnto it. Lastly, for his sake, after
whom it sighes and languishes
with the heat of thirsting loue, scorning
the stinking lakes of wordly
pleasures, and the filthy mire of the
Aegyptian bogs, like a Stag nigh perishing
with thirst and deadly
wounds, with a rapid course and
willing mind, rushes through the
brakes and craggy rocks of precipices,
and hastes to the founteynes of
endles waters, to God the liuing
springPsal. 41..
Oh inexhaustible spring of loue,
quench this thirst, satiate this hunger!
O beauty so antientAugust. Conf. lib. 10. cap. 21. and so
yong! take here possession of the hart
deuoted to thee. Be this I pray a

Temple, a Chapel, an Altar consecrated
to the true and only Godhead.
Admit the incenseExod. 37. and 40. in an odour
of sweetnes, which shal hereafter
fume from this golden table, nor
euer suffer, o God of my hart, the
place thus duly dedicated to thy
honour and loue, to be euer once
defiled with sordityes or crimes, but
rather may it euer and euer stand inuiolable
and vntouched.



I. MEDITATION.

The Preparatory Prayer.
Actiones nostras quaesumus, etc.

FIRST PRELVDE.
IMagin God being in Heauen, seated
on the Cherubins, most highly
blessed, and in essential perfection
infinit, to require here on earth an
Inne to lodge in.


2. PRELVDE.
Imagin the Tabernacle erected of
old, through diuine precept, by
MoysesExod. 26. there the Temple by
Salomon3. Reg. 6. most sumpteously and
magnificently built, and therein the
Propitiatory reposed whence diuine
Oracles were afforded to men.
The hart of a pious man and a
Temple of the Godhead, and hath

three parth with it, whereof the first
the mind, is to be seen in the vpper
place. Here God in the production
of things, as in a high Altar, proposeth
the omnipotency to be seen
and worshiped in the gouern'ment
of them the highest wisdome, and
the infinit goodnes in the conseruation.
The interiour part of the Temple
is the other portion of the hart,
the wil; and here that infinit either
goodnes, or beauty aboue al things,
exhibits it-self most amiable. Lastly
for the out most face of the whole
Temple stand the exteriour senses
which, as reason, and true piety would,
religiously obey the wil commanding
duly diuine things.
2. Point* Moreouer, the Consecration
of this T^eple, the hart I meane
deuoted vnto God, is performed with
the same ceremonies, our Temples
rightly dedicated are. The manner

of sanctifying Temples is, to strew
the pauements al with ashes; to affige
twelue Crosses on the wal; to
burne as many tapers set before
them, to haue water blessed after
the solemne formulary of Processions,
and in the Ashes sprinckled
on the ground, the Greeke and Latine
Alphabet scored out. So his hart
that would be the Oratory of the
God-head, should first be imbued
with humility and the knowledge
of his owne nothing; be illustrated
with excellent faith, signed with
the loue of the Crosse and mortification,
as wel inward as outward,
be instructed by the Holy Ghost; and
lastly, in like manner, purely, and
holily to be cleansed, with the heauenly
waters of diuine graces.
3. Point Now then the hart thus
dedicated, with so many, and so chast
ceremonies, is so in the power and

worship of the diuinity, as hereafter
without a great sacriledge, and a
hainous crime, it may not be violated;
and therefore thence forth, by no
meanes, should euer any sordityes
be seen there, or, as things prophane,
the idolesEzech. 8. of worldly fantasies,
be there suffred to haue admittance.
4. Point. The Oratory of the hart
should rather be dressed and adorned
with the worthy tapistries of vertues
and heauenly ornaments; and great
care be had, that neither by night nor
day the incense of prayer, the fire of
diuine loueLeuit. 6. the goldApoc. 3. of charity
be wanting, or frequent vowes,
prayers; holocausts, or the rest of
victimes euer faile.




THE COLLOQVY.
ARe we then to thinke that God truly
inhabits on the earth? Since if Heauen,
and the Heauens of Heauens be not
able no conteyne thee, how much less, this
house?3. Reg. 8. What? My deare then
(O loue!) it's euen thy place, thy
Temple,Reg. 18. thy seat, thy Tribunal? My
IESVS the delight of my soule, gr^at
this day I beseech thee, thy diuine
presence may consecrate my hart to
thee, as I truely, freely, and voluntarily
vow, giue, and dedicate the
same to thy Maiesty. Possesse it with
the best right and assure it with
so firme a tye, as I may not recouer
it againe by any law or tyme surely
I wil not; but from this Propitiatory,
begin thou to giue Answeres;
yea send downe from heauen, the
fire of the Holy Ghost, now presently
to consume the hoasts, and holocausts
laid on thy Altar.
Pater. Aue.






THE VVORLD, THE
FLESH, THE DIVEL,
assaile the hart, IESVS
saues it for himself.

THE HYMNE.
MYne eyes are open now I see
The nets and snares prepare for me
The world, and flesh haue laid their baits
T'allure my hart, the diuel waits.
Vvhile pleasures of a moment [past
E're th'are enioyd] entice: He last
But first protectour, midst those ginnes,
Midst snares, and tangling nets of sinnes
Lies lurking: And when he'spies
The bird ensnared, out he flies:
OIESV, may my prayer be he^^^,
Spread forth thy nets, I am thy bird
To catch my hart, 'a Pitfal make
Set lime-twigs, doe but touch and take.



THE INCENTIVE.
1. THe world, with silke and golden
chaines, the diuel, with horrid
and crooked irons, the flesh with
libidinous flames of Hel, through
force, through craft, through industry,
here openly, and here couertly
labour very busily to ensnare, and
entrap man's hart. Vnlesse, good
IESV, thou as from an ambush dost
speedily reskue it, with thy succours,
it is lost, it is vndone.
2. Looke, what the world sets
forth to sale are al laid open, but the
wines she carouseth in her golden
cup lye hid the brimms are al besmeared
with honny, the gal with in
is it, that hurts, that kils. Happy he
who by diuine power can wel acquit
himself of these snares, these
nets.

3. And now behold how amourously
good IESVS. loues, embraceth,
puls this hart vnto himself,
and hugs and clings it to his hart,
Doe so good IESV; place my hart
in thy Heauen; I say, with thy delights
and loue, fil, and ouerflow it.


THE PREAMBLE
to the Meditation.
HElp here, O Lord of Saboth!
Loe bring thy succours hither.
The enemies invade thy Sanctuary
to pollute the same; they seeke the
sacred fires to extinguish them; they
violate the Altar of Holocauste to
ouerthrow (...); they bring in strange
and foraine incense, sacrilegiously to
burne to their NumensLeuit. 10. Send
downe thy auxiliary bands from
heauen; the confederate host of Angels,
those spirits, which weild and

brandish thine armes; els certainly
al things wil demolish and vtterly
perish: Traynes are set on euery side,
nette and snares laid euery where.
God gingerly and take heed if you
be wise. Here the world that cheating
and perfidious Mounte-banck
fete forth his wares, to sals, precious
indeed and specious to the eye at
first, but whem you heed them bitter,
alas meer trumpery and counterfeit
stuff. The purse this pedlery
merchant shewes you, beleeue me,
is puffed vp with wind rather then
filled with coyne. The diadems glittering
al of gold, or rather glasse,
amid the few and bastard gemm's,
affright with thornes and briars.
The cheynes of gold or iewels take
which you wil, like iron fetters, honour
not, but onerate, and straightly
bind. What apparel? The Silk-wormes
excrements, with vs being rare,

and scarce, are therefore deare; for
with the Thracians long a goe, these
silks haue been but little worth; nor
wil they like vs, if not wrought; or
interwouen with gold and glitter
here and there, with sparckling
gemmes. But to what end? forsooth
to shroud our nakednes and deformity
with a precious mantle. With
these allurements then the world
seekes to intice to it the hart, and to
that end promises huge mountaynes
of gold, but yet performes besides
the blasts and fickle winds of words,
euen iust nothing. For what law
can he keep or true fidelity, that
wants them both? It is much for it
to afford one a vulgar fame, to puffe
an empty breath of a little glory
which by and by scarce sensible, it
blowes another way. For as often as
you purchase the grace, not of the
vulgar only, but euen of Princes also

with the least offence it is suddainly
snatched away from you and leaues
you gaping after it, with a light
smatch only.
Help, help againe O Heauen!
Behold here a new enemy at hand
the Stygian Dragon, as anciently as
subtlily trayned vp in this field,
that Serpent I meane now so long
since cast downe to helIsaye. 14. from
Heauen and that degree of dignity
he aymed and aspired to. The Deuil,
I say, that Calumniatour, assayes
to rush into thy hold, and that
he may hauock and disturb al things
rangeth vp and downe like a fel
Lyon in a horrible ma^ner, that with
his dreadful roaring if he crush not
the hart altogeather, at least he may
shake it shrewdly. Imagine him an
Aspike, his throat to swel with poyson
his tooth already fastened in the
wound, the very venome now ready

to come forth, where the soule is as
good as dead already. Conceiue
him a Basiliske: this as king of serpe^ts,
is more pernitious then the rest,
as he, which with the only eyes inspireth
death, like a theif encha^ts the
eares with a false whistle and gently
distils into the hart a pest with al:
When being gotten in soaking the
humour thence he pines it vp, and
kils it quite? Or shal I cal him a Crocadille?
You haue then a sworne enemy
no lesse of our saluation then of
the heaue^ly Court, for he faines our
human teares, puts on our effects to
deceiue the better. Nor doth Proteus
so transforme himself into euery
figure, as this pragmatike of the
world turnes and winds himself
euery way into each slight. Nor doth
this warriour vse alwayes the same
weapons or manner of fight for now
he takes prosperity for armes, and

now aduersity; nor leaues he any
tyme or place for truce or respite.
Help therefore, o you Citizens of
heauen, help I say! In this combat
the Anihonyes, the Hilarions, and the
rest of Moncks, most stout Champions,
tremble, sweat, and chaunge
ther colour; who surely were not
ignorant of the forces of this Aduersary.
Is the Casket of the hart repleat
with celestial riches? with
pride and presumption of mind he
breakes it open, steales the treasure.
Is the hart emptie and void of the
riches of vertues and the ornaments
of diuine graces? with despair he attempts
to perpetrate any horrible
fact; and alwayes bends the artyllery
on that side he notes to be weaker
then the rest, where he batters
sore and shakes the wal, while happily
the soule attends the lesse or
makes the lesse resistance. And

holdst thou thy peace yet, o^ God
of Hosts? nor sendst thou as yet, thy
subsidiary spirits, with Michael their
inuincible Captain, to appose a new
and stand against this Pest, to chace,
pursue, to put to flight, and then so
bound to cast it into the inmost dungeon
of Hel, where being once shut
vp, there may appeare no way for
it, to issue forth?
Ay me poore wretch! the external
forth thus foyled, the enemy
begins to rage at home, the flesh rebels
and proud for the good successe
of the noble victoryes got vpon
those stout aduersaryes of hers, tosseth
the warlike fire-brands of concupiscence,
here the fires are more
dreadful farre then were the Grecians
flames. Water, water, I cal
for? Rayn down from Heaue^ whole
clouds of graces, O the only prop,
and stay of my hart, my God; que^ch

with diuine showers, those fiery
weapons, fordged with the hellish
coales;Ephes. 6. wherewith this impudent
brat of Vulcan, Venus wicked
imp, lasciuiously armed dares to
assalt this hart; which thou thy self
wouldest haue for Palace, Tower,
and Temple.


II. MEDITATION.

The Preparatory Prayer.
Actiones nostras. etc.

FIRST POINT.
I Wil consider the largenes and amplenes
of my hart which nothing
can fil, neither the vastnes of the
Heauens, the circuit of the earth,
nor Angels, nor men, nor yet riches
or delights, themselues and

that but he only is able to fil and
b^esse it, who framed it for himself.
2. Point. Hence wil I gather the
worthines and noblenes of my hart,
while it contemnes al created things
nor vseth them otherwise then as a
foot-stoole or stayers, by setting
foot where on it may mount to
God himself. So from the odour and
beauty of flowers, ascends it to the
sweetnes and glory of the Creatour,
from the light of the San-climbs it
to the light increated, from the framing
of the world, it findes out the
influence of diuine loue into other
things, and discouers therein a certain
plenty and affluence of his
guifts.
3. Point. I wil further weigh how
great must the beauty of mans hart
be, with whose loue al things are so
enamoured, as vehemently to wish

haue some place, in the secret cabinet
thereof. The world, that woes it
with allurem^ets of honours, riches,
iewels, and with the same guile the
flesh in presenting enticem^ets, pleasures,
feasts, banquets, good fellowships,
playes, reuels, singing and enchanting
bewitches it wholy: The
diuel, being pleased better to vse
violence, seekes rather with engins,
and frightful terrours to addresse
his way. Now these three enemyes
al conspire in one, and to worke
more effectually their ends with a
wicked treason of the fiue senses, by
vndermining seeke to surprise it. To
the eyes they streight obiect what
soeuer is pleasant and beautiful to behold;
whether you would the deliciousnes
of flowers, or rather regard
the lustre of Adamants and the rest of
stones. To the eares, they apply their
melodious ditties, both perilous

and lasciuious songs of Syrens. Odours
and sweet perfumes are couveighed
to the nostrils with ful sayles. For
the palat the kitchings fume, daintyes
are dressed, and serued vp in ful
dishes; wines are fetched from Cellars,
te^pered for the anciens Co^suls,
Albana Tiuoly, Romanesco, Falerna,
and the like. And so likewise for the
other senses delights are studiously
sought for with al industry and art.
4. Point. IESVS on the contrary, togeather
with the Angel Gardian, very
seriously defendes the Tower of the
hart; he there succours it with the
singular assist^ace of his diuine grace,
this here, in pouring forth light
amid the thicke obscureties therein,
teacheth what to shun and what it
is be done breakes the engins laid
against it, repels the assaults of the
world, detects the obscenes of the
flesh.




THE COLLOQVY.
O MOST sweet IESV the loue
of my hart which thou hast
consecrated for thy self? Oh permit
not in the wals of this Temple the
abhominable figures of created
things to be seen: barricado thy
Tower beseiged of al sides by enemyes
Ezech. 8. with the countermure of
thy feare, defend it with the flames
of loue. Thou easily detectest how
false the things are which the world
obiects before our eyes, while here
the miserable hart discernes nor
heeds the nets nor poison. Then help
it I beseech thee, O Lord of Saboth,
in these streights, and send thy warlike
squadrons, down from heauen,
to its ayd.






THE
MOST AMOVROVS
IESVS KNOCKS AT
the doore of the hart.

THE HYMNE.
I Saw a little glimps of light
As I lay slumbring in the night,
Vvhich through a cranny of my wal
Glaunc'd on mine eyes and therewith-al,
I heard one speake, and rapping hard,
Vvhile al my doores were lockt and bar'd
Vvith that I half awakt lookt round,
And in my hart a theife I found
Discouered by the light. The wals
Vvere bare, and naked, while he cals
Vvho stood without, more light appeares,
T' augment my hopes, and lessen feares;
Then, IESV, I cry'd out, come in,
Here's nonght but a priuation sinne.



THE INCENTIVE.
1. HOw often hath IESVS, to
enter into the Tower of thy
hart, assayled it with armes, to wit,
with the engines of loue; that to the
Angels thou mighst I be a Paradise,
to him a Heauen; if thou let him in.
O iron hart? O hart of Adamant?
God stil is knocking at thy Gates,
and is not yet admitted in.
2. But how great is the fauour of
this louing Numen? God, euen God
himselfe attendes thee, pryes, and
lookes about him, watching tyme
and place to enter in, that he might
sweetly rest with thee. But thou
sticktst vpon it, while the Angelical
spirits stand amazd thereat, as I may
say, either at this goodness of God,
or thy pertinacity, yet thou art nothing
mooued.

3. Oh vngrateful hart! oh perfidiousnes!
To whom wilt thou yeald
them, if to so patient and sweete a
louer peeuishly thou holdst out longer.
If thou flyest as coylie as constantly
he sues?


THE PREAMBLE
to the Meditation.
O Fayrest soule among the faire,
awake; for what Lethean sleep
oppresseth thee? Thy little IESVS,
the purest ioy and delight of Heauen,
raps at the doore: the golden
locks of his head are wet yea trickle
with the nightly dewes; his singers
stil the primest mirrh;Cant. 5. he wholy
drowned and melt with al beates
at the gate of thy hart. Open then
and let him in Alas how thy doores
are frozen with the rock of Caucasus!
How soundly thou sleepest, oh slug,

O fooslish soule! Or is it the noyse
perhaps of the Ghests thou hast admitted
in already, which so taked
vp, and stupifies thine eares, as thou
canst not heare thy beloued's voyce?
Oh Ghests, or hanting Ghosts I
may cal you rather! Oh sinister affections!
Oh inordinate appetits!
What a tumult haue you made here?
And thou, a stony hart! How long
hast thou been so hard to heare, and
deafe, as not to aduert the Spouses
voyce, who to blesse and enrich thee,
meerly pushed, with what winde of
beatitude I know not, hath touch'd
on this vnfaithful Port? Alas! stay
I beseech thee, stay a-while, most
radiant Sunne, nor with thy swifter
steedes, make hast away; for if thou
once substractst thy self, I feare thou
wilt goe farre enough, and be long
absent; a fauour freely offred once,
and lost by a repulse, is not easily

recouered. The diuine hand pow^^
out it's benefits for a day, an hower,
a moment only, it lists not alwayes
to attend to worke miracles, or to
be curing maladyes: the Angel moues
the water of that Poole,Probatica, Ioan. 5. but
on a certaine time of the day; if thou
suffrest occasion once to slide away,
or be taken by another, thou art to
attend the returne of another Angel-mouer.
Hasten therefore, O fayrest
of al beautyes; what? sleepst thou
yet? shake off this sluggishnes. Is
there a mutiny at home then quiet
the tumults, commaund silence, bid
the doore be set open. And if thy
Spouse now wearied with thy demurrs
should chance to diuert from
thee, and goe his wayes, follow him
at the heeles with cryes, and prayers,
and trying him out-right, vrge him
hard, that he would deyne to returne
againe to his Sanctuary. If yet

being called vpon he goe flying stil
away. Like a she-Goat or nimble pricket
on the mountaines of Bethel:Cant. 2. double
thy cryes, put out thy throat, and cry
aloud, Draw me after thee and we shal
ruunCant. 4. my beloued. If the watchmen
of the wals lay hold on thee,
and beat thee cruelly, yea take away
thy cloke from thee: let al these
mischiefs moue thee nothing; the
prey thou huntst for with al these
same, is cheap enough. Sigh therefore
and groane the while, and priuily
shoot forth the fiery shafts of
vehement loue; and if thou canst,
wound him flying with the alluring
tressesCant. 4. of thy desires, with which
chaines at least, so thrown vpon
him, stay his flight: and when thou
art so happy as to ouertake him,
now grown at length more slack,
through flight, thy wound, and
chaines so hampering him pray entreat,



and beseech him, by the holy
Wounds of his body; For his ancient
and faithful mercies sake,Psal. 88. Isaiae 55. he would
please to permit himself to be led
back againe to his Spouses house.
But see you hold him fastCant. 3. nor
let him goe; he is a lightning, and

shal sound the word that IESVS
comes, boldly and confidently open

with thy whole hart.



III. MEDITATION.

The Preparatory Prayer.
Actiones nostras quaesumus, etc.

FIRST POINT.
THE louer IESVS, after a weary
search in vayne, of a quiet place
to rest in, hauing spent therein a
long and tedious night a broad with
his head euen hoary with the serene
and nightly dewesCant. 5. knockes
at the gate of thy hart,Apoc. 3. and because
thou lockst him out; greeues
and complains against. thee.
2. Point. I wil seeke out the cause
of these so tedious and irksome delayes,
or what is it that stope so our
eares, that we cannot perceiue the
sound and voyce of him that raps at
the doore. Surely it is, because the

inordinate passions doe mutiny and
tumultuate with in vs, and stirre
vp, not one only, but many deafe
and dismal tempests, now of anger,
now pusilanimity, now self loue,
and many others; iust as it happens
in a wel-frequ^eted Tauerne, where
the Ghests make such a noyse
among themselues, as one cannot
heare another, that one knowes not
who comes in or who goes forth, or
who knocks at the gate; such a world
there is of Ghests within, such a rabble
of al sorts.
3. Point. I wil weigh the danger,
least IESVS suffering a repulse so
auerted, turne a side into some bywayes
and corners, so as after he
may not be found with the miserable
Spouse any more; whose complaints
are read in the CanticlesCant. 3.
in this manner. I wil seeke whom my
loues soule, in the streets and lanes, saying,

Haue you seen whom my soule loues?
The watchmen of the Citty, haue met with
me, smit me, and wounded me.Cant. 5.
Which hurts, wounds, and teares,
surely had not been if she had but
presently set open her doores to her
beloued.



THE COLLOQVY.
SHAL be framed much after the
manner of the earnest instance
made heretofore, by the two Disciples
going to EmausLuc. 24. saying:
Mane nobiscum Domine. Come into
the secret Closet of my hart; for if
thou once but turnest thy back,
who can follow thee, or euer looke
to ouertake thee, that Giant, who in
a moment runst from Heauen to
earth, like a lightning and thunder-bolt
in an instant casts forth a

flash, and vanishest with al; aud if
thou getst not a place to harbour
with vs, like a nimble kid or faune,
thou takest thy flight to the mountaynes
of Bethel,Cant. 2. to the heauenly
Quyers of blessed spirits. I
know somtimes, the stormes of my
inordinate concupiscences arising
make such obstre perous noyse
with in me, as the pulses sound
without cannot be heard; but yet
doe thou good IESV, through thy
power, wherewith thou art able to
doe al things breake the brazen barres
of the gate, trust back the iron
bolts, and so the doores vnlockt,
enter into thy house and Sanctuary.
Pater. Aue.






IESVS SEARCHETH
OVT THE MONSTERS
lurking in the darke
corners of the hart.

THE HYMNE.
MY sinnes I thought l^y out of sight,
But now I see, al comes to light,
When he to search doth once begin,
Who finds an Attome of a sinne
See there an ougly monster breaths,
An other here, wish horrid wreathts,
Is lurking in this darksome caue.
Oh had I sooner what I haue
Of light; I think no loathsome beast
Had in my hart, made-vp his nest.
Oh IESV, stil thy beames dissilay,
Al this is but the breake of day.
Vouchsafe to send with lustre heat,
To make it lightsome, feruent, neat.



THE INCENTIVE.
1. SO long as IESVS is absent
from my hart. Ah me! what
monsters? what sordityes? what
Gorgons? what wicked fiends? what
hels are centered there?
2. When IESVS enters into the
hart, and therein pours his light,
Good God? what foule, what horrible
prodigies of vices the mind
discouers there which the eyes had
neuer yet detected? I say while
IESVS puts forth his rayes, what
bestial manners? what perfidiousnes?
what blots of an vngrateful
mind? what haynous crimes are represented
in this detestable hart?
3. At these portents the very Angels
tremble. Yet goe thou on, my
most sweet IESVS; Illuminate the
darksom corners of the foule, cleanse

this foule infamous stable. Amid
this Cymerian darknes, with glimps
of thy light bewray me to my self
that being hateful to my self, I may
abhorre and shune my self and so at
length may fly to thee, loue nothing
els but thee. Oh the only Darling
of my soule! O only loue of my
hart, my little IESVS!


THE PREAMBLE
to the Meditation.
LOrd enter then into the Tower
set open to thee, and dismantled
wholy; which thou long since hast
purchased with the price of thy
bloud, and in this thy triumphal
entry, as it were, so shoot forth the
diuine rayes of thy countenance,
that the clouds being vanished quite
and slunck away, the strange portents
of vices, and restles Enemyes,

which lurke therein, may be constrayned
to fly away. Search Lord
with thee shini^g lamp of thy knowledge
al the hidden corners of this
thy Sanctuary. Ay-me! what horrible
beasts haue we here? What
harpyes, what hydreas, or other
monsters, more foule and virulent
then these, harbour in this Porch of
Hel? Ambition auarice, those base
and detestable beasts, here set vp
their rests here the ominous screechoules,
here the black and fatal progeny
of rauens, haue built their nest.
Oh! my Dearly beloued, goe on;
Search with thy lanterneSoph. 1. the closest
corners of the hart, and discouering
the swarine of lewd concupiscences,
which here euen pester
the miserable hart, crush and destroy
them quite. I haue groan'd to thee
long, but hitherto my sighs were
intercepted, and the broken sound

of my strayn'd voyce, the stronger
out-cryes of the Enemyes, haue so
choaked and stifled, as we could
not be heard. Aboue al things (for
hence must you begin) survey, and
illumine, my God, the abstruse and
winding corners of my mind; and
bringing in the light of the knowledge
banish thence foule ignora^ce
of things euen necessary for the
conseruation of thy Sanctuary. Alas
what a faint and languishing light
of faith haue we here? vnles it borrow
force of thy light, it cannot dissipate
the fogs, nigh palpable,
which here haue place: whereas if
thou shal but shead the lightest
beame of thy presence thereinto,
streight shal infidelity, apostasy,
ignorance of thy mysteries, or any
other errour blinding the mind, euen
banish quite.
Goe forward then, bring thou

thy clearest lamp, into the inmost
cabins of my wil. Alas! how foule
it is? How like it is Augias stable,
or a sty for Swine? I blush thereat.
How crooked and vntoward
is my wil from thine, my God, who
are euen rectitude, sanctity and
goodnes it-self? Correct, direct
this crookednes of mine; frame my
vowes and effects to the most iust
square and norme of thy diuine wil.
But now bring that both of thine
into the regions of the memory. Ayme!
what corners and windings
haue we here againe, of brawles,
of enmityes, which frequent
thoughts of iniuries feede, foster, and
cherish, whereas indeed they should
not once be thought vpon. But as
soone as thou shalt shine therein I
know wel those foule notes of ingratitude,
vnmindfulnes of benefits;
memory of ini^ries, deeply rooted,

shal cleane be expunged thence: Goe
further now if you please, into those
blind holes, search there with in
those blacke and vgly dens; I say
those secret allyes of the hart and
bowels. Oh how I tremble-at it, to
see how many snakes there are!
What spiders, what scorpions, and
other such like plagues, and alas!
what a huge swarme there is of
them? How many busy buzzing
gnats; peeuish wasps, il-fauoured
butterflyes! What a vast throng of
wormes there is, and what a stench
from thence exhales to heauenwards!
O thou most burning Sunne, who
with da^ting of thy rayes heretofore,
didst sodainly scortch and
wither the greene and flourishing
Iuy,Ion. 4. soake and dry vp the noxious
humour of concupiscence,
which enuirons the hart, til thou

hast quite exhausted al. The cloudy
PillarNum. 1. in times past, detecting
a farre off, the snares of the Enemy,
as a faithful Guide of the way,
went before and conducted the people;
So let thy heauenly rayes of
thy countenance strike then with a
dread and horrour, who haue the
face, or rather are so impudent, as
to dare once hostily to inuade the
hart by thee so rescued, saued, and
purchased for thy self. Be there no
night hereafter in this place, but
let a cloudles, seren, and perpetual
day here raigne: and as in the seats
of the blessed Spirits, the Sunne,
nor Phebe's face is to be seen, but thou
Sunne of iustice plac'd in the midst
of a most bright and quiet Kingdome;
spreadst round about and
sendst forth a glorious light:Apoc. 21.
so, (I beseech thee) shine, burne,
and flame forth in this little orbe of

my hart, O immense light, O dateles
and infinit verity of my God.


IIII. MEDITATION.

The preparatory Prayer.
Actiones nostras, etc.

THE PRELVDE.
THe eyes of our. Lord are more lucid
then the Sunne,2. Cor. 6. more bright
then lightning, and yet saith he,
I wil suruey Hierusaelems with lamps. (b)
1. Point. Consider in IESVS his
absence with how many, and what
mists of obscurities, the hart of man
is beset. IESVS indeed, is the true
light, which illumines a like the
Angelical and sublunary world. For
as wel from Angelical spirits as humane

minds, with light diuinely
shed, he banisheth the darknes of
ignorance, and errours; which shining
forth anon giues euery thing
it's price and estimation; while the
good, the euil, the profitable, and
hurtful, are knowne, and distinguished
as they are indeed; and lastly thou
maist easily discerne, whither thou
art black or white, euen as the Sun
arising giues to each thing its colours,
which the darke and sable
night had confounded before.
2. Point. Consider then, how
powerfully IESVS, as soone as
admitted to enter into the hart, expels
and banisheth al sinnes from the
secretst nookes thereof, to wit, his
most capital enemyes, wherewith
he would not haue any thing to doe;
and surely what society can be, between
light and darkness2. Cor. 6. Marke this
also, how aptly vices are expressed

in the formes of Serpents, owles
toads, dragons, and what els, in
Styx or Libia, is more vgly, foule,
pernicious.
3. Point. Behold how the Angels
are astonished, seeing those monsters
of vices so detected, and chased away
by IESVS: What madnes, say
they, or blindnes is this of men, to
suffer so importune and vicious a
pest to domineer and raigne ouer
them?



THE COLLOQVY.
LORD, how long shal the wormes
of sinnes possesse and gnaw
my bones, which in the accursed
soyle of my hart, without seed rise
vp alone of their accord? Shal these
Stygian Dragons, and cruel vipers,
stand alwayes before the eyes of my
mind, to strike and wound my soule

with a thousand and a thousand terrours?
Shal I eternally feele that
gauling prick of conscience, day and
night, like furyes, to wound, to
launce, and murder me outright?
search very seriously, good IESV,
euery corner of my hart; omit not
the least path of this labyrinthian
errour, where thou studiously pryest
not, least perhaps some dormouse,
batts, wormes, escape thine eyes. So
truely is it fit thy seat should be expiated
and purged from these Hellish
fiends, which now for so many
Ages past thou willingly wouldst
haue to be dedicated and consecrated
to thee.
Pater. Aue.






IESVS SVVEEP^
THE DVST OF SINNES
from the hart.

THE HYMNE.
O IESV thou art come from Heauen,
Find'st lying al at, six and seauen,
In seueral shapes, my horrid sinnes
To sweep away the broome begins;
Not like the chips, when thou didst keep
At home, and with the besome sweep
The dust, and little chips, which flew
About the house, but now in view,
Thou sweep'st, as chips cut from that tree
Which was the sourse of misery,
Those mo^sters, loathsom dust, where breeds
Th'old serpent; on this filth he feeds.
Hels Scauendger, come take thy load,
The muck the viper, serpent, toad.



THE INCENTIVE.
1. GOE to, you pure Inhabitants
of Heauen, which ioyned
prayers tire out the gracious and
benigne IESVS, that he would
deyne to cleanse this hart, of al its
filth. For we sily dwarfs, as woulded
but of slime, can neither lift vp our
eyes to Heauen, nor open our lips
to prayer.
2. Would any one beleeue? Oh
force! Oh excesse of diuine loue!
God with a secret force applyed, of
holy affections, and a liuely sorrow
of the mind truely penitent, as certaine
besomes, conferres succours
of diuine grace; where-with from
the floure of the hart he sweeps out
the filth of ^innes.
3. Goe on, my little IESV, and
oh! expel, tread, crush vnder thy

holy feet this poysonous virulence
of serpe^ts, which with their venome
intoxicate and kil my soule. Destroy
them quite, and so frame me a hart
wholy according to thy hart.


THE PREAMBLE
to the Meditation.
VVhen Lucifer, foyled by the inuincible
forces of MichaelApoc. 12.
that great Leader of the heauenly
Hoast, with his factious and rebellious
squadrons, was cast downe
headlong into Hel, a new light was
seen to shine in heauen, new peace
to smile, new loues to burne, and new
delights to powre forth themselues.
Besides, the glorious victories acheiued
vpon the Moabits, Iebus^ans,
and other barbarous Nations, either
expulsed or els constreined at least
to pay tributes to the people of Israel,

bred a general peace and ioy to the
whole Palestine.
But alas! the Leader of this infernal
Legion, thus precipitously
throwne downe, what a dreadful
terrour brought he vnto sea and land?
For hence amid the ioyful and triumphant
acclamations of the blessed
Angels, this verse was rung into the
eares of miserable mortals, Woe to sea
and land, because the deuil in a great rage
descendes vnto you.Apoc. 12.
Hence truly, the open springs of
al our euils, hence flow our teares,
hence these so many snakes deriue
their being, which occupy and so
cruelly torture our minds. But what
is this? I am deceiued. For me-thinks
I see a huge shole of serpents, chased
away from the lurking den of
the hart. But alas! how I feare, least
the enemies in their flight may leaue
therein some impression or print behind



them. Surely thou excellent
Dauid didst daily exercise thy self,
and sweepst thy spirit, as thou hast
written of thy selfPsal. 76. yet with al thy
study and exactnes, doe what thou
couldst, thou couldst neuer bring to
passe, but some little dust would alwayes
yet remayne, or slimy trace
be left behind, at least from the trailing
of those serpents.
It is very wel: IESVS with new
brooms in the Chapel of the hart
stands sweeping out the dust, least
ought should escape his industry or
eyes. O admirable thing! The blessed
Spirits, stand amaz'd at this, either
lowlynes of mind, or officious
diligence of his, and yeald him
thanks for that benefit bestowed on
man. Goe to then, O thou victorious
and triumphant IESVS,
spurne, trample this Hydra, a beast
of so many wicked serpents heads,

kil him with thy flames, that hereafter
he may haue no enterance or
place in thy Sanctuary. And thou,
most Blessed Dearling of my hart,
fortify and preuent al the wayes and
passages of the enemy, and place
strong Guards at the entryes and
gates thereof, least happily they
steale or rush in any where; for they
are not al of one and the self-same
kind. Some there are which like
dragons with a foule and vgly flight
corrupt the ayre; some like Aspikes
and vipers, craule on the ground,
some sodainly peep vp like lizards,
and leap away againe; others like
touds lye lurking at the very gate
of the hart, vpon aduantage, yet
slouthful the while. These like bats
be stirre themselues by night only;
they on the contrary of the race of
harpyes or hauks, appeare by day,
and attend their prey: So great necessity

thou hast, deare soule, not
to be idle at any tyme or place. Nor
yet truly as soone as they are thrust
out* by the powre and industry of
IESVS, is al the busines quite
done: For then the banished pests
euen choake the aire againe with an
intollerable stench, thunder and lightnings,
cast forth outrageous stormes,
they tumult, they rage, they
mutiny, they trouble al things, and
euen menace and threaten al extreamities,
vnles (which they clayme as
their right, and exclayme to be their
due by title of victory) they may be
suffred and haue leaue to returne to
their ancient home, againe. But thou
my sweet IESV, open the earth the
while with a horrible rupture, and
fold them vp with a like ruine, to
that, wherein of old thou threwest
to Hel the double prodigyes, those
spirits, refractory and rebellions to

thee. And that they may neuer be
seen or heard of more, or raise any
new tumult, being-bound, and sent
to those dismal vaults beneath the
ground, damne them to eternal darknes;
that they may loose al hope of
returne againe, or raging any more.


V. MEDITATION.

The preparatory Prayer.
Actiones nostras, etc.

FIRST POINT.
HOw fierce and cruel a warre
God made in Heauen once
against sinne, may hence be gathered,
in that he damned Sathan and
his Co^plices, precipitously throwne
downe from those happy seates of
beatitude vnto the extreame torments

of euerlasting fires. How implacable
a warr likewise he brought
against the same very enemy on earth
as easily appeares, in that he feared
not to descend into the lists of this
mortal lifeIoan. 3. that fighting foot to
foot, and hand to hand, he might
vtterly defeat the deuils works, to
wit, sinne. Lastly, how deadly a hatred
he beares in Hel to that wicked
enemy, is cleere enough by this, that
not enduring sinners to remaine any
longer in these lists, bidding them
depart, he banisheth them, into such
miserable dungeons of eternal punishments.
2. Point. Attend besides, with
what study and diligence, he commaund
the monsters of vices, to pack
away from our hart, like as a noble
General in warr, as soone as he hath
taken some Towne or fort, either
by a sodaine stratagem or assault, remoues

the ancient Magistrates, and
pute the souldiours in Garrison from
their ranck and place, nor suffers
any one to remaine behind, that
might stirre vp the least sparckle of
any treason.
3. Point Now with what iubiley
and joyful signes the Angels exult
and triumph in a manner, when they
behold that infamous rable of portents
to be thrust forth, and chased
from our hart! How stand they
amazd in the meane tyme, at so great
a multitude and deformity of enemies!
But how especially they admire,
that infelicity or stupidity of
ours, that we should euer seeme to
afford any place to such execrable
and damned Ghosts as these.




THE COLLOQVY.
OH what dulnes of mind is this,
what stupidity of hart, that we
should so long suffer these monsters,
to rest and abide with vs, as if they
were some friends and familiars of
ours! Oh truly admirable goodnes
of God! who hath attended and expected
vs so long to returne to the
duty and office of good men; and
now at last most powerfully hath
brought vs into liberty, wherefore
we wil stedfastly purpose, and determine
hereafter, to die rather, then
once to afford any place in our
hart to sinnes.
Pater. Aue.






IESVS THE LIVING
FOVNTAINE IN
THE HART.

THE HYMNE.
BEhold the fountaines liuing springs:
Both here and there in Angel bring*
Souls soyl'd with vgly spots within:
Oh how I now am loathing sin!
Which nought could wash but streames of
bloud,
That issued from Christs wounds o floud:
The sourse. from whence thy torrent flowes,
Is IESVS hart? 'tis that bestowes
Eu'n the lasts drop, to cleanse my spots.
O scribled hart, with blurrs and blots
Of horrid crimes! wash, wash, with teares,
Thy sinnes. Thy paper written b^ares
Being once made white, (what doth afford,
Al ioy, content, repose) the WORD.



THE INCENTIVE.
1. IF IESVS be absent, I am arid,
dry and with out iuice; so as
neither I feele God, nor any thing
of God. Oh cruel aridity! O fatal
drought!
2. IF IESVS be present, he sheads
diuine dewes of graces, he opens
springs of incredible sweetnes; the
hart flotes only and swimes, and
sincks in these torrents of celestial
delights. Oh grateful dewes! O
blessed springs! O ineffable delights!
3. Angelical hands lade heither
those waters of life, sprinckle therewith
my hart and soule, cleanse, and
water them with endles springs of
Paradise.


THE PREAMBLE
to the Meditation.

O Holsome streames of Siloe
Iohn. 9. Whereof the blind no
sooner drinke, but they presently
recouer the Light of their eyes! O
powerful waters of Iordan, where in
Naaman plunging himself, his flesh
became imediately like the flesh of
a little Child, and so was cleane!4. Reg. 5.
O profou^d Spring which streaming
downe in the midst of Paradise,Gen. 2.
thence diuides it-self into foure
heads, so many riuers, wherewith
it washeth a great part of the earth.
The one called Phison* which passeth
by the Region Heulach, with a most
commodious riuer, for the vse of
mortals, washes and waters al the
parts of the world. The other G^hon,
passeth along by Ethiopia. The third
Tigris, that rapid and viole^t streame,
with scours the Assyria^* The fourth
Euphrates, so renowned in the monuments
of sacred Writ. And oh! to

me sweet waters of Iacobs wel! with
one draught whereof the poore
Samaritan womanIoan. 4. felt the thirst;
and head of concupiscence slacked
and quenched in her, which til that
tyme no springs, nor yet whole
flouds, could take away quite, or so
much as refresh or diminish neuer
so little. Nor can I choose but admire
thee, O prodigious springs,
which with an endles streame
sprungst from the iaw bone, with
whose Herculean strength, Sampson,
as armed with a triple knotted club
foyled and vanquished a thousand
Philistins.I^dic. 15. Lastly, O thou most
blessed Spring, at whose waters,
those so happy flames of nuptial
affects, betwixt Isaac and Rebecca
Gen. 24. were anciently kinled!
But, O miraculous things behold
here from the bottome of the hart,
an endles spring to arise, plenteously

watering with seauen channels
the vniuersal face of the earth.
Behold there that master, pipe,
more large and ample then the rest,
from whose head as it were eternal
waters flow into the other six. But
^ix thine eyes especially vpon IESVS
who keeping in the center of the
hart, in prodigal and profuse vrnes
or cesterns distributes whole flouds
of graces. Hence mayst thou discerne
the primary springs of iustification,
to breake forth, thence more
copious streames of conseruation
to flow, and of the other side, the
flux or flow of graces to swel
againe and grow into a vast sea of
waters. These are dealt to such as
first begin, those are offred them
who walke the way of perfection,
others with ful channel are powred
forth to such as climbing the ^ublime
mount of vertue are got to

the top. Casting thine eyes here also
behold how in these streames of
limpid, veynes, certaine little
Ethiops (who I know not) are washed,
with the ministery of Angels,
and how bring cleansed, from the
coale-black race of crowes they are
transmitted into the candid family
of doues. Come h^ ther then you dry
and thirstie soules, flock you hither:
Why drinke you so long of those
bloudy streames of Egypt? Why
carouse you so those muddy marish
waters of the durty Babylon? Why
prize you those false bewitching
cups of the world, to with, that
C^cean hag? Here maist thou rather,
o thou foole, drinke thy belly-ful of
endlesse liuing waters; and wash if
thou wilt, and rinsh thy whole
mouth; with which draught thou
maist put off the old man, quench,
thy thirst, take courage lastly deriue

thee a whole streame of water Springing
to eternal life (a)Iohn. 4. Wherefore doe
thou wash me Lord from mine iniquity,
which vow was familiar with
Dauid.Psal. 50. Wash I pray and first
my wil, alas! defiled with the filth
of extrauagant and wandring affections;
and especially with the
sordid dust of self loue. Wash my
mind also, and with al wipe away al
darknes of ignorance and errour
from it. Wash likwise my hands,
ah! (how I blush for them) so fowly
dight with crimes. Wash my mouth;
how I blush againe! how slow, infamous,
impudent Wash my tongue
I euen tremble to say it) so intoxicated
with the poyson of scurrility
and calumny. Wash my palat, alas!
with sootist relishes corrupted. Wash
mine eies, ouer-cast with the noxious
colours of wrath and melancholy
humours: myne eares, enchanted

with the entici^g charmes of witches,
Syrens: my feet also soyled with the
dust and mire of lewd concupisce^ce:
my hayr, and lastly cogitations, for
these also are in foule plight: so is
there nothing in me that is not
impure and il affected. Ah! I dye of
thirst, and desire of thy loue! Oh
quench and extinguish the thirst,
the heat of my dying hart! O eternal
loue! inexhaustible Spring! But
your, thrice happy Cittizens of heauen,
o glorious Angels, who as certaine
riuers flow from this fountaine
of al good, receiue and shut
vp first with ful minds the whole
spring it-self, them in the open lakes
of your harts, plunge this my dry
and thirsty hart, drowne it in the
ocean of loue. So I coniure your by
that very loue, which is the immense
spring and fountaine it-self, from
whence you haue taken both your

nature and spirit, of whose draught
you stil liue, and shal liue, as long
as Eternity lasts: very happy and
blessed.


VI. MEDITATION.

The preparatory Prayer.
Actiones nostras, etc.

FIRST POINT.
COnsider sinne to be a true
leprosy: for as this infects and
fouly spots the body; so that vitiates
and corruptes euery part of the hart
and soule; and though the act be
past, yet leaues a foule and vgly blot
behind it.
2. Point. Consider further, this
most vgly and foule blot is not washed

away, but with the bloud of
the only immaculate Lamb: which
neither the sacrifices or ceremonies
of the old Law, nor fasts, nor other
austerities of this kind can wipe
away without the sprinckling of
this bloud: For without bloud, remission
is not had.Heb. 9.
3. Point. Consider lastly, that as
heretofore the posts and threshal
of the house being smeared with the
bloud of the Lamb, with held the
sword now drawn and ready to
strike, of the smiting Angel, from
killing them in the house by a death
so studiously preparedExod. 12. so with
this bloud, al hellish power is expelled,
and restrained, that those
wicked foes of our saluatio^ may not
touch the very entrance of our hart,
or dare so much as looke vpon it:
Lastly as the Preistly robes, yea the
Sanctuary it-self was sanctified and

hollowed by the bloud of the Lamb
Exod. 29. so beleeue from the bloud of
Christ al sanctimonyHeb. 9. deriues
into our minds.



THE COLLOQVY.
LOrd wash me againe, from mine iniquities,
and cleanse me from my sinne.Psal. 50. Wash the mind, and let al the
clouds of ignorance vanish quite.
Wash the wil, and purge il appetits
conceiu'd from the false nuages of
transitory things: wash the memory,
and wipe away self-loue growing,
from an ouer-weening of my self,
and my own doeings.
Cleanse my feet, hands, eyes,
and tongue, nor let any thing
remaine in me, that is foule and polluted,
or wich may any wayes offend
thy Maiesty, neuer so little.
Pater. Aue.






IESVS PVRGETH
THE HART WITH
expiatory bloud.

THE HYMNE.
OHart lie open freely take,
These sprinckled drops, enough to slake
The flames of lust and quench the fire,
Of bel it-self, O Hart desire
Thy Lord, now is he entred in,
To put to flight the deuil sinn,
The world th^ flesh: Behold h'is gone,
Thy contrite hart* plow'd, harrowd, sown,
May, wat^red with his heauenly dew,
Spring forth, and fructify anew:
To which annex some pearlik drops,
That thou with ioy maist reap thy crops.
Raine followes wind; sigh, teares begin,
And drown as with a deluge sinn



THE INCENTIVE.
1. ALthough the hart be vnworthy
and wholy vncapable
of score of celestial graces, yet
IESVS howsoeuer, of his soueraign
goodnes, powrs thereon and sprinckles
it at least with some little
drops thereof, to instil thereby into
the soule the first loues of heauen,
and to excite a thirst thereof.
2. Behold in IESVS absence, how
dry, dul vntoward, poore, miserable
the hart languisheth and pines away;
how the Angels likewise scanding
round about, and ful of horrour,
are amazed the while, and with reuerence
are praying to IESVS to be
moued at so great a misery of the
humane hart.
3. Goe to then, water, water, O
most sweet IEVSV, this vnhappy

hart: sprinckle it at least with some
little drop of the ful fountaines of
thy sweetnes. It is now enough,
sweete IESVS; for loe the hart
came presently to it-self againe, as
soone as it felt but one little drop of
thy diuine loue to be spri^ckled on it.


THE PREAMBLE
to the Meditation.
MOyses, it is to no purpose to
take the aspersour in hartExod. 24. Heb. 9.
and with a purple thread to tye the
ysop so about it; with which dipt
in the bloud of the victime; thou
busily purgeth the Altar, the volume
of the Law, the whole people, attentiuely
listning to the statutes and
precepts of God: this shed and sprinckled
bloud, wil not expiate sinnes,
ror to the Tabernacle or Leuits afford
any sanctity a whit nor wipe away

the spots of leprosy, nor cancel
the stigma or seared print of sinne;
vnlesse with al thou reguardst this
fountaine, this bloud, which alone
can wash away the monstruous sordidues
and which shed on the tree
of the Crosse yeald life to soule
imparts a candour and beauty to
them, and that like to the ^unne,
which in the ful of the Moone,
powres forth his light vpon her orbe
and to sick mortals makes her more
amiable. Nor truly for ought els
that water and bloud so flowed from
the side of dying IESVS; then to
ennoble soules, being cleansed with
that purple to wash their robes, to
make them fit and apt, that crowned
with victorious laurels they may
eternally triumph, with the immaculate
Lamb.
Take therefore O IESVS, loue
of my soule, from this infinit bath

of thine some few little drops, at
least, and sprinckle thy Sanctuary
therewith, I say, the ample field of
my hart; whose shure possessi^o, thou
hast taken to thy self long since. But
you, O smitting Angels, goe farre
away hence, the house is marked
already, the signes of Tau is printed
on the doores: be-gone I say;
for where this marke is seen, it is a
crime to enter in. Oh would to God,
my IESVS dearely beloued, with
Dauids feruour, I could pray and
obtaine this fauour at thy hands.
Lord blot out my iniquities, wash me
yet more from my wickednes, purge me of
my sinne. Thou shalt, sprinckle me with
ysop, and I shal be cleane, thou shalt
wash me, and I shal be whiter then the
snow. Turne away thy face from my
sinnes; and blot out al my iniquities.
Create in me, O God, a cleane hart, and
renew a right spirit in my bowels.Psal. 50,

Let there be no corner, I beseech
thee, which thou purgest not no
portion of my soule, which thou
blessest not with the fruit of thy pretious
bloud. The swallow with her
owne bloud restotes sight to her
bling yong ones. The bloud of a
Goat expels al manner of poyson.
Againe, the bloud of doues, let forth
beneath the wings, quickens the
dulled species of the eyes: nor is it fit
my God, nor iust that from thy
precious bloud, my hart should not
feel likewise the same effects. The
bloud of victimes shed from the
sacrificed Holocausts, bred no corruption,
nor stench, nor flyes, that
sordid creature, but rather eu^n
destroyed those importune and irksome
things. The Sacrifice at Bethel
Gen. 35. offered vp by Iacob, they say, was
so purely and holily performed that
not a fly disquieted the Patriarch:

busy in this rites. I wil not, Lord
I wil not haue my hart a Bethanues,
or Temple of BelOse. 10. a pestered
with flyes, and ruining al
with filthy and corrupt goare: where
Belsebub4. Reg. 1. giues forth his Oracles,
and exhibits himself, awful and
terrible to men, in despaire of their
saluation. How I hate these direful
and dreadful Sacrifices, these rites!
Thy bloud, O sweet IESV, is alwayes
red with purple, and white
with lylies intermixed.Cant. 5. For
these two colours thou affect'st, the
purple red, and snowy vhite; wouldst
thy Cliens, and deuotes addicted to
them, and to be known by them.
This bloud of thine, to thirsty soules
quenches their heat, to hot and
toyled spirits sends a humid breath;
to broken and dismaid harts, giues
fortitude and courage.

THE PRELVDE.
IN the midst of the Temple, was
placed a huge brazen vessel, wh^ece
many channels yssued forth, apt to
communicate their waters, for the
vse of Preists and Leuits, where with
they washed themselues when they
went to sacrifice.Exod. 3.
Weigh the munificence of God,
who thought it not enough, for declaration
of his famous and good
wil towards vs, to water the hart of
man with his owne bloud, vnles he
left vs also a fountaine famous for

seauen channels, from whence the
guifts of graces might plentifully and
prodigally flow into our minds, to
wit seauen Sacraments instituted to
this end, to wash vs, to expiate our
sinnes, and to wipe al steynes from
the hart.
2. Point. Consider the grace, which
flowes from the fountaines of the
Sacraments, to be a golden water,
which turnes al it touches, into gold;
and that so powrefully and diuinely,
as there is not the least action of
our life (so it be sprinckled with
the liquour of diuine grace) which
we ought not to make more reckoning
of, then of al the treasures and
riches of the world; as meritorious
and worthy of eternal happines.
3. Point. Consider now, how al
graces, and merits depend of the only
Sonne of God, and thence ^re deriued
by certaine pipes or aqueducts

as from the rock or head of these liuing
waters: Wherefore we are most
studiously to receiue and keep this
liquour of grace; least any whit
thereof should breake from the
bancks of our hart; nor is any occasion
of heaping merits to be omitted,
which we greedily reach or catch
not at.



THE COLLOQVY TO
the wounds of our Sauiour.
MY soule, O God, hath thirsted
after thee;Psal. 62. vnles thou replenish
it with heau^ely waters, who
shal recreate or refresh it? My soule
is blacker then a coale;Thren. 4. who

which refreshed the heat of the people
of IsraelExod. 15. dying nigh with

cruelly with the tongue and hand
of the Sinagogue! a rock, I say, not

pilgrime people into Palestine. Oh
you holsome Iourdan waters of Naaman
4. Reg. 5. flow with a copious channel
into my hart, that no locks or
sluce at any tyme may hinder your
course. But your, O you heauenly
Ministers of God and mans saluation
diue and plunge in this fountaine
placed in the midst of the
house of God, those Ethiops our

with the wretched colour of
vices; that by your meanes, being
rised and cleansed once they may
issue forth like doues. Amen.

IESVS RVLES AND
REIGNES IN THE
louing and deuout hart.

THE HYMNE.
OMightie Souer aigne, if you please,
To deigne a looke and view our seas;
Where harts like ships with wind and tide
Are sayling; some at anker ride,
Some with waues and boystrous windes
Tost to and fro;' mongst them you find
My floating hart, with euery blast
Of greife or of affliction past,
As' twere immersed with in the maine.
But yet, Greate Monarch, if you deigne
To be my Neptune, or to guide
The sterne of my poore hart, beside
The surges flying ore my decks,
Reigne in my hart, let Hel play reks.



THE INCENTIVE.
1. VVhen IESVS sits in the hart,
as in a Throne and there commands,
the hart is a Paradise, our
cogitations, affects, desires, are euen
as Angels, Cherubins, yea Seraphins,
so here doe al things burne with diuine
loue.
2. God raignes nor rules not?
Sinne therefore swayes and beares
the rule, most tyrant-like; and strikes
and wounds the miserable hart,
already stretched on the cruel rack
and torture, with terrours, scruples,
horrid spectres, bestial appetits: no
hart, but euen a Hel.
3. Little King, great God, tame
my rebellious hart, subdue it to thy
heasts, and eternally commaund it:
Surely I wil doe what I can to dedicate
and consecrate it to thee: doe
thou defend the place, wherein thou
likest wel to be shut vp.



THE PREAMBLE
to the Meditation.
THe pacifical Salomon in those
dayes of old had built him a
Throne of iuory3. Reg. 10. six degrees or
steps in height, on both sides whereof
watched a Lyon, very exquisitly
wrought, the truest symbol of regal
Maiesty; and likewise for the people
beneath in the midst of the Temple
he erected a very eminent and stately
Chapel. And so to thee Immortal
God; the heauen is a Throne the
earth a foot-stoole. For thou sit'st
(as sacred scripturesPsal. 17. tel) vpon
the wings of Cherubins, whence
thou giuest Oracles, prescribest lawes
to the world; and euen with the only
looke, maiesty, and state, becomst
most terrible to the haughtiest mids.
Hence thou exactst iust punishments

from the damned: hence thou inebriatst
the blessed Citizens of Heauen,
with the nectaral honey of thy
goodnes: lastly hence thou carrousest
cups mingled with the gal of iustice,
and honey of pure goodnes, to the
earth, suspended betweene heauen
and hel. Besides in the triumphant
Church the celestial spirits, whom
we cal Thrones, are thy royal seat;
and in the militant, the sacred Altar
is thy lodging chamber, where thou
sweetly takest thy rest.
But nothing is thine owne so much
or due vnto thee, with a better title,
then the hart of man, which with
a low abasement of thy self, and a
singular obedience to thy father,
thou hast lawfully recouered and
bought with the price of immense
labour and paynes; yea redeemed
with thy bloud, and a shameful death
on the Crosse. Here, o pacifical

Salomon, thou rulest, there thou commaunds
with a beck, in this soyle or
seat, as in thine owne dominion,
thou swayst in that manner, as there
is none so bold or of so impudent a
face, that dares, vnbidden, step in
a foot, or, not touched with the
point of thy golden scepter,Ester, 5.
looke in a-doores. Here thou hearest
the humble suits, and petitions
of thy subiets, here thou stiflest lewd
desires, putst a bridle on the rebellious
senses, tamest the insolence of
carnal concupiscence, sweetnest the
acerbity of labours. And, (O most
happy kind of gouernment!) thou
alone sufficiently sillest the whole
hart, attended with a most happy
trayne of heauenly Citizens which
thy retinew or Court can neuer depart
from thy side, or vanish from
thine eyes; so strongly tyest then the
minds, harts, and loues of al vnto

thee. Moreouer in the basis or foundation
of this royal edifice, stands
faith, more cleere then any Chrystal;
in which glasse of Eternity, mans
hart sees and beholds the past and
future things. The whole frame susteines
it-self, on that, thy surest and
most constant truth; where with thou
proppest and holds it vp. For if
faith leane not vpon thee, it cannot
hold the name or dignity, of faith.
Now the steps by which they ascend
into this Throne of the hart,
are those which the Kingly Prophet
insinuats, where he sayth: They shal
passe from vertue to vertue.Psal. 83. Humilitie
lyes in the lowest place, obedience
followers, anon pietie ariseth
then patience shewes it-self; resignation
attends and perseuerance
tops and crownes them al. The fou^dation
faith consists of Iaspar, each
stair shines with his special gemmes.

The first, is black with ieat, the second,
greene with the emarald, being
the colour of hope, the third glissens
with the purest chrystal, the fourth
is hard with the adamant, which no
contrary violence or force can master;
the fift euen sprinckles fire with
the chrisolite, but the Carbuncle,
the sixt, flashes forth both fire and
flames at once: yet thou midst al,
my sweetest IESV, o prodigy! not
only sits secure, but euen deliciatst
thy self.
There are besides, two litle columnes
or pillastres of this Throne;
loue appeares on the right hand,
and feare of thy iustice is to be seen
on the left: yet sitst thou so venerable
with diuine Maiesty, in this humane
seat of the hart; as the face of
thine enemies, cannot behold the
dignity of thy countenance, or
endure thy aspect. There thou

giuest precepts, and art presently
obeyed; commaundst, and thy
heasts performed in a moment. The
Angels themselues, euen the Cherubins
and Seraphins, tremble to
approach any neerer; as who know
wel enough, this litle region to be
properly thine, so only made for
thee, and so due to thee by right of
purchase, as whatsoeuer is lesse then
thee, or shorter then eternity cannot
please or satiate the hart; grown
proud of such a Lord. For it is hungry
and thirsty, nor liues contented
with any owner, vnles thou fix
the seat of thy kingdome in its precincts.
If thou beest present with
it desires no more; if absent, come
in al created things at once, and wooe
it neuer so much, there wil yet be
place enough for more. If thou getst
from thence, al felicity departs with
thee: if thou abidest, al beatitude

comes sodainly thither. Raigne therefore,
and eternally raigne in my
hart, O loue of my hart. Quiet the
motions of perturbations, nor euer
suffer the vnhappy hart; to thrust
the King out of his seat; then which
cannot happen a greater disastre to
it. Nor suffer I say, o darling and
delight of my hart, that one hart
should be shared into many parts.
For thou sufferest no riual. Oh
suffer it not euer to be enticed with
the allurements of worldly pleasure,
which gate being once set open, I
see how easily the enemy wil rush
in. Be thou to it a brazen, yea, a wal
of fire, which may so roundly girt
the Tower, as that no passage may
be found vnto it. But that only
the Holy Ghost may come downe
from Heauen, whereto the hart
lyes open and enter therein, with a
ful gale and occupy the whole hart;

that so I may truly professe and
glory, My beloued to mee and I to him.Cant. 2.


VIII. MEDITATION.

THE PRELVDE.
MY Kingdome, is not of this world,
(a) for my Kingdome is thy
hart, o soule deuout to God.
1. Point Consider how God seemes
to make but litle reckoning of
the rule, and gouernment of heauen
and earth, in regard of the dominion
and care he hath of mans hart;
wherein, as in a breife epitome or
abridgement, he summs and collects

togeather the whole perfection of
the Vniuerse.
2. Point. Consider againe, how
sweet the yoke of Christ is; compared
with the most cruel and direful
tyranny of the deuil. For into what
horrible vices and abhominations,
doth not this wicked Tyrant and
cruel butcher of soules, drawe men
who are subiect to him? How farre
this Lord differs from the genius of
the world. For if this Impostour
promise mountaynes of gold to his
clients and followers, after a long
and irksome bondage, after a tedious
yoke, and loads of intollerable iniuries,
which it layes vpon them, it
really performes nothing but smoak
of words and empty shadowes. Lastly,
how diuerse this Masters benity is
from the hard and cruel apprentiship
of the flesh, which for a singular
reward of most abiect seruices, repaies

nothing but a thousand sordities,
and miseries, as wel of the soule
as body.
3.Point. But on the contrary,
where IESVS rules in the hart, the
appetits, which were before vnbridled,
comply with the law of reason,
and the soule-it-self, reduced as it
were into the forme and order of a
watch, being in tune and wel disposed,
poyseth al her thoughts, words,
and works, with iust weight and
measure.



THE COLLOQVY.
SHal be with the most sweet
IESVS, earnestly beseeching
him he would take ful possession
of the hart, commaund therein, as
in his Kingdome, and exercise an
ample power vpon al the faculties
of the soule: that he would aduance,

pul downe, enrich, impouerish;
lastly fraue it to each beck
and signe of the most holy and
diuine wil.
Pater. Aue.






IESVS TEACHETH
the deuout hart.

THE HYMNE.
O IESV speake, thy seruant heares,
But thou must find me pliant eares,
For of it-self my hart and wil
Is seeking drops that doe distil
From a limbeck that's rais'd on high
With streines of wit, which soon are dry.
Oh let me heare what thou dost speake
(Peace) in my hart! Ah, if it leake,
As doth a vessel pierced through,
It naught avails to heare. For how
Can I retaine that in my breast,
Except some heat of grace digest?
Oh with thy lessons that impart!
With thee Ile soone get al by hart.



THE INCENTIVE.
1. BEhold here my litle Doctour
teaching from the pulpit of
the hart. O speaches al of milk! O
nectar! How affectiously the speaches!
With what a grace he teacheth
How ioyfully the hart leaps, while
it takes the words of eternal life.
2. Like Maister like Scholer;
especially if he take delight to hang
on the lips of God, instructing as a
Maister; and with prompt and ready
eares and mind but drinck his inspirations.
Here truly he playes not the
mans, but teacheth the Angels part,
yea is indeed a very Angel.
3. Diuine Doctour, teach me to
doe thy most holy wil, euery, where
and in al things; for I require no
more. I shal sure be wise enough,
when thou alone shalt tast and
relish with me.



THE PREAMBLE
to the Meditation.
THe tyme wil come, o delight
of my soule, O Spouse of
bloud,Exod. 4. when mount Caluery shal
be thine Accademy, thy diuine humanity,
thy booke; for woden
Chair, the hard Crosse, where this
volumne shal be laid vpon, for
points, stripes, Lashes for commaes,
for Auditary of so diuine a Maister,
the wicked Iewes. Al men shal read
in that book, and if they mark,
vnderstand, how potent thou art,
who canst so aptly linck togeather,
things by nature so farre distant
from each other; life with death,
folly with wisdome, pouerty with
riche, strength, with weakenes, gal
with hony, high with low. Here
the disciples of the. Crosse shal learn;

with what pretty slight of thy wisdome,
the most tender worme2. Reg. 23.
of thy humanity hanging on the
line and hooke of the Crosse hath
drawne out of the bowels of mens
harts, that horrid and cruel fish
LeuiathanIob. 40. and crushed his head:
with how vnvsual an instrument,
the engine of thy humility, thou
ouer-threwest that mad Tower of
Babel, brakest with thy meekenes
the adamantin hart of the Iewes,
how with thy admirable sweetnes
and affability, like that worme
(which seemed a prodigy to Ionas)
Ion. 4. thou didst so smit the root of
that flowrishing iuy, as suddenly al
the leaues withered, that is the ceremonyes
of the ancient Sacrifices
were abolished, Altars demolished,
the preistly and regal power of the
Iewes, the splendour of that flourishing
nation, in times past, withered

like a tree strooken and blasted
from heauen. Lastly in this open
and vnfolded book, al posterity shal
acknowledge what were those ancient
mercies, of thine,Psal. 88. hidden
hitherto in the immense treasures
of thy bowels, and euen the Gentiles
themselues whom the diuine goodnes
might seeme to haue cast off for
so many Ages past, shal now behold
the most abstruse secrets of the
highest things, hidden heretofore.
But now, [most louing Doctour)
doe I see another. Schoole set open
to thee, the spacious Galery of man's
hart, a noble Lyceum, wherein
thou Lord and Maister teachest the
soule, thy disciple within and instructest
her with the precepts of thy
most holy wil. Speake therefore, I
beseech thee Lord, the eares of my
hart are open, speake O loue of my
hart, for thy words are sweeter then

the hony, and the hony comb:Psal. 18. milk
and holy vnder thy tongue, the honycomb
distilleth from thy lips.Cant. 4. Oh
fiery words of loue! Strong, efficatious,
endles, thundring words,
which impetuously throw al things
to the ground, ruine Ceders, fetch
vp mountaines by the root, reare
the lowly hil lying in the plaines
strengthen collapsed minds, dash
and crush the proud: Lastly; words
of a most indulgent Parent, teaching
his dearest child al manner of holsome
precepts. Lend thine eares
then my hart; God is he that speaks.
Heare my Child (for so IESVS
aduyses from the pulpit of the hart)
doe thou giue thy self to me: Let
me be thy possession, thy nurse, thy
food, for nothing can satiate thyne
appetite without me. My Child,
throw away those leekes and garlik
of Egypt, turne thy face from the

stincking waters of pleasure, and
put thy mouth rather to my side,
the wine-cellar of graces, whence
at ease thou maist draw and deriue
to thy self most soueraigne and incomparable
ioyes: For sake thy self
and thou shalt find me; leaue the
vayne contentments, of the senses,
and thou shalt purchase to thy self
the solid and sincere delights of Heaue^.
Learne of me, child, not to build
thee worlds, or frame new Heauens,
nor to worke wounders,Aug. serm. 10. de serm. Dom. but
learne that I am me^k and humble of hart.
Mat. 11. Be alwayes mindful of benefits
bestowed vpon thee; for nothing so
exhausts the riuers of diuine grace,
as the blasting vice, of an vngrateful
mind. Be present to thy self follow
thine owne affairs, square al thy
actions to the exact rule of reason,
and perswade thy self this, and haue
it alwayes in thine eyes, that thine;

and the felicity of al rests in me the
only soueraigne good.


IX. MEDITATION.

The preparatory Prayer.
Actiones nostras, etc.

THE PRELVDE.
THey shal be al docible of God.Ioan. 6.
1. Point. Consider how Almighty
God, from the first creation
of things, hath proposed al his
perfections to be openly read in the
book of creatures.Sap. 13. Rom* 1. For by the
ample spaces of Heauens, he hath
manifested his immensnes; by the
diuersity of celestial influences, the
variety of his guifts and graces; by
the splendour of the sunne and moone,

his beauty; by the admirable viciscitude
of the seasons of the yeare, his
prouide^ce; by the immoueable firmnes
and stability of the earthly globe,
his constancy and immutability, by
the plenty of his benefits wherewith
he hath most copiously endowed
vs, his goodnes; Lastly in the huge
vastnes and depth of the seas, he
hath left the inexhaustible abysse of
his essence expressed as it were in a
paincted cloth.
2. Point. Consider besides by what
meanes the same God heretofore
hath explicated his mysteries to vs,
with diuers Oracles of Prophets, and
with the manifold shadowes and
figures of the old law.1. Cor. 10. Heb. 11. So the
greene bushExod. 3. vntouched in the
flames, signified the virginity and
^ecundity of the Virgin-Mother.
The brazen SerpentNum. 21. with whose
aspect, erected in the wildernes, were

cured the wounded, slung with serpents,
expressed the Crosse, and death
of the sonne of God, to be the holsome
remedy of miserable mortals.
The mariage solemnized betweene
Salomon and the Egyptian, woma^2. Reg. 11. and
represented the hypostatical vnion
of the eternal Word with the humane
nature.
3. Point. But while these things
seemed but smal to the great immensity
of his loue, he himself being
made man, came downe vnto vs; and
taking possession of the hart; and
assuming to him the office of a
Teatcher, instructs it, and deliuers
the art, not of working miracles,
nor of building new worlds, but
imbuing it with new precepts and
altogeather vnheard of hitherto.
Learne saith he of me, because I am meek,
and humble of hart.Mat. 11.
4. Point. I wil endeauour to giue

my mind very frequently and seriousl^y
to learne this lesson by hart,
wherein consists the summe of al
Christian perfection, and I wil examine
my self how dilige^tly hitherto
I haue behaued my self therein, and
what method I wil afterwards keep
to be exact.

SHal be directed to the Holy
Ghost, most earnestly crauing him
to afford me light to comprehend
the diuine mysteries; a hart docile and
apt to receiue such lights and motions;
strength of memory, least the
species of things once receiued may
easily vanish away; and force sufficient
wherewith to execute what I
shal thinke fit to be doue.
Pater. Aue.






IESVS PAINTS THE
IMAGES OF THE LAST
things in the table of the hart.

THE HYMNE.
O Rare Apelles; loe the frame,
My hart; but first prepare the same,
Which is al slubbered 'ore with sinne,
Wipe al away, and then begin
To draw the shapes of vertue here
And make the foure last things appeare^
That no Chimeraes of the brayne,
Or Phantasies I may retayne.
Besides vouchsafe to draw some Saint,
Begin, sweet IESV, figure paint,
Whom I may imitate, and loue,
As did Narcissus. From aboue
Descend Apelles, thou diuine,
Come euery day and draw some line.



THE INCENTIVE.
1. NOthing is more miserable
then the hart when it giues
licence to wandring imaginations,
and liberty to self loue. My God!
what images! what phantasies! what
enormityes! what folies are depainted
there!
2.But after that IESVS, the diuine
Painter, hath entred into the
shop of the hart, and taken the hart
it-self as a table to draw and paint
therein, thou maist streight discouer
the image of God and Trinity reformed;
the effigies of IESVS, and
MARY drawne, the whole celestial
Court represented, and the face
of the gallantst vertues expressed;
whether with greater lustre of colours,
or feeling of piety, or delectation
of the mind I can not say.

3. O most louing IESV, imbue
my hart with the colours of Heauen,
paint not shadowes, but genuine
and natiue images, snowy innocence,
greenes of hope, the purest
gold of charity; that so the closet of
my hart may come to be a certaine
Cabinet or Reliquary of al perfections.


THE PREAMBLE
to the Meditation.
MY hart (my IESVS) is an
emptie table, since thou hast
wipped away thence the images
and fading shadowes of worldly
things, and throwne downe the
idols which I my self had wickedly
erected in thy Sanctuary; take
then, I pray, thy p^ecils in thy hands,
and dip them in the liuelyest colours
thou hast; that no series or tract of

yeares, nor inclemency of the ayre,
nor dust raised from the earth, may
blemish or deface what thy al-working
hand from the most absolute
idaeas of the eternal wisdome, hath
diuinely painted. For thou, o great
Artisan, hast set downe in writing
with thy hand, those noble soules,
Abraham, Isaac, Iacob, and the rest
of the family of the predestinate.
Thou truly, art that admirable
Authour, who didst put the last
hand to the azure orbes of Heauen,
appliedst the purest gold to the
Starres; the greenes of the emerald,
to the herbs, the snowy candour to
the lillyes, the crimson to the rose,
the purple to the violet, pale with
yellow mixed. Thou sprincklest cristal
on the adamant, the etherean
brightnes, on the saphir, the Vulcan
flame; on the carbuncle: Lastly,
thou hast endowed al things, as wel

sensible as insensible, with such variety
of colours, and sweet delectation
as the eye cannot be satisfied
with beholding them.Eccl. 1.
And in this huge vastnes of the
world, my God, thou hast shewne
thy omnipotence, which the eye of
the mind may wel admire, though
not conceiue or comprehend but in
the diuersity of created things,
which a strange knot, concording
discord, and discording concord
most streihtly tyes together: thou
hast impressed the liuely image of
thy infinit wisdome in the order of
this vniuersal Al; but there is not
among al thy creatures any one, no
not the least of them, wherein conspicuous
draughts of thy goodnes,
shine not euery-where. Since therefore
my hart is a void table, already
sit to be wrought, draw I beseech
thee diuine Painter, and here delineate

only these foure images, which
deuouring tyme with no age may
cancel or were out. And first frame
in this table, that last grimme, and
dreadful line or period of my life,
and let these here be the draughts of
this sad image: Let me lye as dying,
with eyes sunke into my head, with
pale and deadly face, leaden lips, let
death stand by threatning with a
terrible iauelin in hand, here the
deuil menacing with weapons of
temptation, there the Guard an
Angel breaking his thrusts, in my
defence. Aboue be the Iudge seen
attending the passage and issue of the
soule, let the children houle at the
doleful bed; the seruants, each prouiding
for himself: adde, if thou list,
the cossin lying not farre off, wherein
the senselles corps is to be laid,
vntil that day, whe^ the last trumpet's
found shal sumon the buried to arise.

Oh holsome and profitable Picturel
whole only aspect wil shew me that
is, my nothing, to my self; and
laying the swelling winds, wil hold
me in my earth, that I grow, not
proud yea wil giue me a generous
and stout hart, that triumphantly I
may trample on the trash and trumpery
of the world, and creeping on
the ground with frequent sighes
preocupying death, before my death
mount vp to heauen.
Now pious IESV, I pray draw,
and finish also the other part of the
table, of the other side; with due lineaments.
Be that maiesty set forth,
wherewith as Iudge thou shalt appeare
one day, and be seen of al
to handle and discusse the causes of
the liuing and dead: let me here behold
thee sitting in the clouds, with
the mouth armed, with a two edged
sword, and with an eternal seperation

seuering the sheep from
goats. On which image as often as
I shal cast mine eyes, I may feele
the bit and feare of thy dreadful
iustice cast vpon me, whensoeuer
I shal lash out like a fury, into the
precipices of vnbridled appetites.
Goe on heauenly Artificer, now
must thou, paint a Hel, that lake so
dreadful for its sulphur and flames,
where the vnhappy soules cheyned
together, with howling and disparing
cryes fil al things, and with
that tragedy publish their wretchednes,
and miserable condition. So
exhibit the whole, as I may seeme
to behold the vncleane spirits, touch
the darknes self as with the finger,
feele the gnashing of teeth, heare
the horrible blasphemies, their cries,
their pathes, their flegme which in
vaine they cast forth against God,
their bans and cursings, wherewith

they cruelly teare one another, that
being astonished with the sight of
this picture, I may eternally sing
thy mercies,Psal. 88. which hath held me
vnworthy a thousand and a thousand
times, from this lamentable
abysse of infinit euils.
Lastly, my good Painter, looke
where the rest of the ample space
of my hart, seemes void, I say not
expresse, but shadow, I pray, the
image at least of eternal glory and
beatitude. Exhibit howsoeuer which
a rude draught that house and royal
seat, where thou layst open the most
diuine treasure which thou hast
reserued for thy children, with
the title of inheritance. Here let
that great and blessed City of celestial
Hierusalem, built al of goldApoc. 21.
and precious stones, euen dazle the
eyes; there let the Citizens of heauen

be seen clothed with the sunne
that graue Senate of Patriarchs and
Apostles, with heads crowned with
golden diadems, besides those valiant
Heroes, who with the price of
their bloud and life, haue purchased
themselues immortal laurels. Figure
also that mount, purer then christal,
wherein the candid mother of the
lamb, and the rest of the virginal
flock deliciat with the Lamb himself,
amid the chast delights and
Quires.Apoc. 14.
Now then that these foure pictures
may the better be conferued, let
them not be enclosed I pray in Mosaical
work with certain litle stones
linked and cimented togeather, least
perhaps disagreeing with themselues
they fly a sunder, but let one be
set in ebony, another in cypres wood,
the other be garnished round with
plates of siluer, al enameled and set

with topase stones; and finally the
last be deckt with the richest gemmes.
Take off thy hand now if thou
please, the worke is fully finished.
Yet one thing more remaines, my
diuine Painter, of no smal reguard,
forsooth, that to thine exquisit work
thou adde a curten, least vnluckily
the dust, or moister ayre, or more
vntoward mind, may euer taint or
least obscure so elegant and terse a
picture.


X. MEDITATION.

The preparatory Prayer.
Actiones nostras, etc.

THE PRELVDE.
I Would to God they would be wise, and
prouide for the last things.Deut. 32.

1. Point. Consider IESVS to be
an excellent Painter, who with the
only pencil of the mouth, to wit, the
draught of one litle word of fiat,
painted the whole world with so
great and artificious a variety of colours;
and how in each creature he
hath expressed very excellent lineaments
of his power, wisdome, and
goodnes.
2. Point. Thinke what force hath
the liuely image and representation
of death, perticular iudgement, and
Hel, to restraine the lawles liberty of
our life and too excessiue mirth; and
how much the remembrance of the
heauenly glory preuayles to stirre vp
the mind in the course of vertue, and
to take away the difficulties they vse
to meet with, who walk that way.
3. Point. Thinke this also with thy
self, how the pictures and the images
of the foresaid things expressed, at

no tyme, should be wiped away from
the table of the hart, this being the
sourse of al our teares and errours,
to be so careles and backvvard to
conceiue and premeditate before
hand, vvhat is to be exhibited in the
last act and period of our life.



THE COLLOQVY.
SHal be made to God, beseeching
him not to suffer, that either the
delights and honours of the vvorld,
or prosperity and aduersity may euer
race out of our minds those pictures,
vvhose affect is so necessary for
vs to our Saluation.
Pater. Aue.






IESVS BRINGS IN
THE CROSSE INTO
the hart, and easily imprints
it in the louer.

THE HYMNE.
HAst thou no Harbinger to bring
Thy furniture, so great a King,
But must thy self in person come
To order al, and hang this roome?
My hart alas! (...) hardly brooks,
To be tran^fixt with tenter book^;
For nayles and hamner, now I see,
And ladder, al prepar'd for me.
Ah! without sheets I see thy bed;
Thy Crosse, no bolster for thy head
Except it be a crowne of thorne,
Thy canopy is Heauen forlorne.
Al things lament thy paynes to see,
IESV come in, I'l mourne with thee.



THE INCENTIVE.
1. GOe in louely Crosse enter
launce, spunge, nayles,
scourge, bloudy, thornes, get you
in to the Closet of the hart. Welcome
stil, but on this condition that
IESVS bring you in himself; for
mirrh with IESVS, is admirable,
and meere sweetnes.
2. Thou saist thou louest IESVS;
then needes must thou his Crosse:
for if otherwise thou boast to loue
IESVS, thou deceiuest thy self and
others.
3. Most sweet child; what haue
you and I to doe with this lumber
here? scarce art thou come into the
world, but thou art oppressed with
the weight of punishments. Oh
plant thy seat in my Hart! and then
shal I chalenge Hel it-self: for if

IESVS and I hold togeather, what
Hercules can stand against vs both?


THE PREAMBLE
to the Meditation.
MOst worthy Painter,Psal. 87. I pray,
take the table in hand againe,
for before thou, makest an end of thy
worke in the escuchion of my hart,
thou must needs paint thine armes,
with some motto or other that by
the deuise thou mayst be known to
be the Master of the house.
The Palaces of Kings, and their
houses, as wel in the Countrey as
Citty, euery-where are wont to giue
forth their titles, armes, and names
of their Ancestours, to wit, the monuments
of their royal stock and
ancient nobility. As for thine armes
and tropheues of thy name good
IESV; I take them to be thy Crosse;

nailes, lau^ce, crown' of thornes scourges;
that Pillar whereto thou wert
bou^d; and those very cords, wherewith
thou wast tyed. I (sayd he) haue, been
trained vp in labours fro^ my youth.
Goe to then, for my sake, among
those foure images of the last things,
which thou hast fully finished in al
points, let these instruments, as
Tropheye of thy Passion, be likewise
pourtraited. The Crosse would
be of Cedar, that is painted in his
proper colour; the speare sprinckled
with bloud, the nayles dipt in the
same dye, the pillar marked with
drops and streakes of bloud; lastly,
the cords and scourges with bloud
also, but so as washt away with
teares here and there they make
certain distinctions between. At sight
of these armes, if they offer to encroch
or approach neerer to the hart
be the enemies dispersed; and fly as
wax before the face of the fire. But

ho^ my Lord, print I pray that Crosse
more deep into my hart; if it be churlish
and resist, vse viole^ce with it and soften
it if need be; if with too much
softnes it proue il and diffuse it-self,
constraine the parts, to consist and
hold together; but be sure that euery
colour thou here workest with be
wel mixed with thy bloud, for this
colour pleaseth best, as being the
simbol of loue. Be this Crosse to me
sweet IESVS, as a buckler, to rebate
and blunt the weapons of the
enemyes: be it a wal, or trench to girt
me in; armes for me to assaile my
enemyes with al, may it stirre in me
alwayes, first a fresh and liuely memory
of thy passion, then a burning
desire of suffring with alacrity for
thee al hard and cruel things; no
otherwise indeed then of those thornes
were roses the black-berries;
the whitest-lillyes: let this wood,

cast into my-mind, turne the bitternes
of the waters, into sweetnesExod. 5.
change gaul into hony, alloes to sugar,
Let the Crosse be the mast of
the sayling ship, wherein transported
I may happily land at the hauen
of saluation; my bed; where couching
as the Phenix in her nest, and
consumed with the flame of loue,
and turned to ashes I may dye Iacobs
ladderGen. 28. to mount to Heauen by;
the Pilgrims staff to passe the Iourdan
Gen. 32. the sheep-hooke, to keep in
the straying senses in their dutyes;
Pharus whereto I may direct my
course in the tempestuous Sea of
the world, amid the thickest fogs or
fowlest weather. May the launce
and scourges strike a terrour to the
proud and rebellious spirits, that
menace a far-off, and reuewing the
assault by sits try to inuade thy
Sanctuary. Pitch Lord, and plant

this Crosse of thine in the turret of
the hart; be it there a standard, which
being aymed at, as the Captayns
signe and signe of warre, may al the
faculties of my mind anon, be summoned
with alarmes, and pel-mel
directly rush vpon the enemy. Being
armed with this Crosse as with the
keenest sword, I may cut off the
wretched head of the cruel Holofernes
Iud^^^h 13. and rise vp against my Aduersaries,
like that Angel, who in a
night alone foyled and vanquished at
once, a huge army of the proud4. Reg. 19.
Senacherib. Wherefore auant you
hellish troops, packe hence away,
and fly vnto those darkesome vaults.
There is none of you that dares abide
before the Tower of the hart,
where the armes of the Supreame
Numen are now set vp: in sight
whereof the Angelical squadrons
stand in battle array; where not only

horrour and dread but imm^nent and
most present ruine waits vpon you.
For death himself at the sight only
of the Crosse, turnes his back; sinne
also takes his flight a long with
him, and both togeather with th^ir
common Captain Sathan the deuil,
in great dispaire tumble headlong
in the lowest Hel.


XI. MEDITATION.

The preparatory Prayer.
Actiones nostras, etc.

THE PRELVDE.
Pv^^^ as a signe vpon thy har^.Cant. 8.
Be thou as wax, for euery forme;
I vvil be the seale, and imprint the
armes of my passion in thee.
1. Point. In the co^quered and va^quished
Tower of the hart the victorious Iesus,
placeth the trophies and triumphs

of his passion, forsooth, as Lord and
Master of the place, least any one hereafter
may chance to chalenge it to
himself, or seek to inuade it.
2. Point. There can be no such force
or power of te^ptations, which vvith
the liuely apprehe^sion of these armes
may not vtterly be defeated; no aduersity
so great, which may not cheerfully
be borne; no such allureme^ts of
worldly pleasures; which with a generous
loathing may not be reiected.
3. Point How happy the soule which
is nayled with Christ vpo^ the Crosse!
how rich, while vnder that wood are
found to be the riches of Heauen and
earth! how defensible and secure against
al the power of Hel, being the imprenable
Tovver of Christians, whereon
a thousand targets hangCant. 4. the whole
armary of the stro^g, either to endure
the shock of the enemyes or to assaile
them.




THE COLLOQVY.
SHal be made by turni^g the speach,
by way of Apostrophe, to al the
symbols of Christs Passion, as nailes,
lance, vvhips, and also vnto Christ
himself, crauing most earnestly of
him, as wel to conserue in our
minds the memory of those things
which he hath suffred for our sakes,
as to admit vs into the society, and
communion of his most bitter chalice;
that we may also merit one
day to enioy our part of glory and
eternal felicity.
Pater, Aue.






THE HART CONSECRATED
TO THE
loue of IESVS is a
flourishing garden.

THE HYMNE.
IESVS, thy power and gratious wil
Is alwayes drawing good from il,
And life from death, and ioy from grones,
And Abrahams childre^ mak^st of stones.
Behold a quick-set is my hart,
With thornes and bryars on euery parte;
One drop of bloud alone thou shedst
Wil make a rose, wheres'er thou treadst:
Oh may my hart sweet odours breath
Of vertue! Ah! thy thorny wreath
That pear^'d into thy brayne made red
And parple roses on thy head.
Then for my sinnes, that I may mourne,
With roses grant a pricking thorne.



THE INCENTIVE.
1. IF IESVS, be in thy hart, thou
needst not feare, the vnlucky
accidents of man's life, for he of very
thornes makes sweetest roses.
2. The most sweet odour of the
white and ruddy rose, which IESVS
is, recreates and refreshes men and
Angels, kils the rauenous fowles.
Hence when the hart with IESVS
is beset and closed in with roses,
sinne and the deuil get them far
enough; for they cannot abide the
smel of them.
3. Wilt thou be a soft couch, wherein
litle IESVS may like to repose
and rest in? let the Hart be crown'd
with the roses of vertues with the
snowy flower, of innocence, with
the purple of patience, and breath
the frangrancy of true deuotion.

Here IESVS feedesCant. 1. here he
sleepes.


THE PREAMBLE
to the Meditation.
Ovr litle bed is flourishingCant. 1.our
garden likewise is al beset with
flowers. Here the sweet smelling
balme exhales an odoriferous breath
here amid the snowes of lillyes,
the rose-grow al purple; here Cinamon
with safron, cassia mixed with
mirrh, haue a fragrant odour with
them; there is nothing here that
breathes not admirable sweetenes
to the smelling. Come therefore,
O loue of my hart, my beloued, that
feedst among theCant. 2. lillyes, who
delightst in flowers, come into the
sweet delicious bed, or rather, if
thou wilt walke the spacious allyes
of the orchard and in the walkes.

Oh my Sun, dart those fruitful rayes
of thine eyes, and with thy sweetest
breath more gentle then Zephirus.
inspire an odoriferous soule into the
flowers, wherewith my hart being
hedg'd in, like garden-plot; euen
smiles vpon thee. Here the humble
violet, fairer for her lownes, euen
wooes thee with her soothing flatteryes,
the higher sending her odours
as she stoopes the lower; a noble
symbol of a lowly mind; which
vertue; as a first begotten daughter
thou hast kissed from the cradle and
tenderly embraced, Here the lilly
rising somewhat higher, from the
ground, amidst, the whitest leaues,
in forme of a siluer cup, shewes
forth her golden threads of safron
in her open bosome; a noble
Hierogrisike of a snowy mind, a
candid purity, and a cleane hart,
which now long since haue been

thy loues: for hence that strange
obsequiousnes of thine in those thy
yonger dayes, seeking and complying
so with thy Virgin-Mother.
Here now besides the pourpourrizing
rose, the flower of Martyrs
dyed with the sanguine tincture of
their bloud, represents that incredible
loue which put thee [o loue
piously cruel!) and nayled thee on
the Crosse; so as it is lesse to be wondered,
it should dare so afterwards to
cast the martyrs into flaming furnaces,
into cauldro^s of melted lead, into
burning fires, with liuing coales;
load them with Crosses gibbets, punishments,
and take away those actiue
soules, which yet these generous
and noble Champions, very
willingly lay'd downe of their owne
accord. Here also that bitter mirrh,
but bitter now no more, whose
chiefe force consists, in preseruing

bodyes from corruption; distils those
firstCant. 1. teares of hers more bitter
then the later ones that follow after;
but so much sweeter, as more powerful:
This shewes and represents those
teares, sighes, pressures, labours,
which thy dearlings, Confessours,
Mo^ks, Anchorites, haue taken voluntarily
vpon the^, while in the doubtful
course of this life the pious Pilgrims
hyed them to the heauenly countrey.
But, O most sweet IESVS to
rauish thee aboue the rest with admiration,
and his loue, the heliotropion
of my hart, that flower, the
genuine image of the Sun conuerts
it-self to thee; whom therefore so
assiduously it followes, for hauing
so from nature such, a hidden force
and sympathy with that eye of the
world, the parent of al light. In
this flower doe nestle harts
enflamed with thy loue, whose

voyce is euen the very same, with
that of thy Spouse; My beloued to me,
and I to him.Cant. 2. Deliciate thy self
then, IESV the delight of my hart,
amidst these amenityes of flowers,
and from those fragrant and odoriferous
garden beds, let the blessed Spirits
thy companions weaue them co^onets,
and delightful garlands, more
pleasing, I dare say, to thy diuine Maiesty,
then those of old, so offred vp
in LacharyZach. 6. wherewith the head
was deckt of the sonne of Iosedech,
the high-Priest. Yea wil I be a little
bolder with thee; doe thou thy self,
my IESV, from thy Garden gather
and pluck thee flowers make thee posyes,
wreath thee chaplets, and doe
your Angels only help the while. My
litle IESVS first shal choose the
gathered flowers himself, then shal
you bind them vp with a golden
thread, and lastly he with these flowers

these wreaths, these chaplets shal
compasse in the hart about, that with
this preseruatiue and odour of these
flowers, he may banish from the
mind al contagion that may vitiat
or infect.
Goe to then goe on you blessed
Spirits, but I pray giue him the rarest
flowers into his hand, euen the pride
and honour of the eternal spring,
which neither heat of sunne may
fade, nor tempest or showers deface
nor obscure the lustre, beauty or dignity,
which the diuine graces prodigally
haue powred vpon them.



XII. MEDITATION.

The preparatory Prayer.
Actiones nostras, etc.

THE PRELVDE.
Ovr bed flourisheth, saith the Spouse.
Cant. 1.
1. Point. Consider IESVS to be
truly a Nazarean, that is flowry or
flourishing; for the loues to be conuersant
with the sweet odours, and
flowers of vertues. Wherefore I wil
ponder, how grateful it is to him to
repose and rest himself among the
lillyes of purity and chastity; the roses
of martyrdome and mortification,
the violets of humility and
prayer; the Sunne-affecting marigolds,
that is, the noble soules, and
pliant to euery beck, of the diuine

wil; and other garden plots, of the
rest of vertues, with whose loues,
he is so taken, as that euery-where,
at al occasions, he sents their odours
and hunts after them.
2. Point. These flowers should neuer
fade, with any weather, not with
the parching heate of the sunne, I
say should not wither with the heat
of carnal temptations, nor hang the
head with the southerly wind of austere
sadnes; nor pinched vvith the
cold and frozen blust^ring of the
north, that is, not nipt or blasted with
the euil breath of dulnes in spiritual
things: but should rather be continually
watered with the dew of celestial
graces, and from the substance
of the hart, deuo'yd of al corruption,
draw and deriue their iuice and bloud,
where by they might prosper and
flourish euer^more.
3. Point. I vvil seeme to behold

the litle IESVS, sporting in this
litle flovvry garden of the hart, picking
here and there, and plucking
with his hand, now those flowers;
the Angels remayning astonished at
so great familiarity, and adoring the
vvhile. But for me I wil resolue vvith
my self, to keep especially the lilly
of chastity inuiolable, vvithout the
least staine or blemish of its candour.



THE COLLOQVY.
TO the most Blessed Virgin, Mother
and Disciple of al chastity,
of vvhom I vvil craue the meanes
first to keep chastity, and then earnestly
beg her help and patronage,
to vanquish easily al the temptations
of the flesh.
Aue maris stella.






IESVS SINGS IN
THE QVIRE OF THE
hart, to the Angels playing
on musical instruments.

THE HYMNE.
IF thou within my hart wouldst a wel;
OIESV, then what Philom^l,
Could warble with so sugred throte,
To make me listen to her note?
The Syrens of the world to me;
Would seeme to make no harmony.
When they a long a large resound
Of pleasures, thou dost them confound,
Chanting a long, a large to me,
With ecchoing voyce, Eternity!
A briefe of pleasure, with like strayne
Thou soundst a long of endl^sse payne,
The Diapason, ioyes for me,
To liue in blisse eternally.



THE INCENTIVE.
1. VVhat doe me heare my hart,
what doe we seeme to heare.
How sweet are these rapts? how
sweetly this ^clestial harmony enchants
the soule, and rauisheth it
quite besides himself. Oh happy
houer! O happy lot! when IESVS
and the Angels sing in parts, to the
melody of the Heauens.
2. When the hart sweetly respires,
it sighes for and after, IESVS,
and chants forth his praises with a
glad some spirit. O musike. O incredible
consort! I heare me-thinks the
Quires of celestial symphony to
sound; and see my self in the midst
of celestial ioyes.
3. Let thy voyce sound in mine eares
Psal. 88. my Beloued. For to speake in
a ward, most humbly prostrate at

thy feete, I here, protest; that neither
I doe nor wil euer loue any other
then the sweetest dolours and passions
of IESVS. Away with these
flatteryes of self: Away with these
bewitching Prostitute of carnal pleasures.
Syrens auaunt with your alluring
charmes of my affections, Let
IESVS only sound in mine eares.
For his voyce is sw^^t and graceous his
sface.Isa. 48.


THE PREAMBLE
to the Meditation.
O Sweet harmony! O diuine confort!
Or are we mocked the
white? I heare me-thinke a lute,
the harpe playes, the flutes and cornets
wind, a whole Quire is kept in
the hart; and if I be not deceiued it
is a song of three parts; they seeme
to play according to the number of

the musitians that play. For the
Angels here of th'one side, though
they vse diuers instruments; yet sounding
but one thing seeme to play
but one part; then IESVS the skilful
and most exquisit Musitian tunes
his voyce, and beares his part; lastly
the hart hath his. For amidst these
numbers it sings and dances al at
once. How quaintly and aptly the
strings, wind instruments, and voyce
al agree: With how admirable a
pleasure the numbers quauer and
iump with al. But then how noble a
Hymne is sung the while how curious
and elegant IESVS stands in the
midst, not only a singer, but as a Rectour
of the Quire also with a magistrat
rod in hand now lifted vp, and
then let fal; keeping the time, and
ordering the key and ayr of the
whole song. If you aske me the subiect
of the dicty the Royal Psalmist

Psal. 88. had designed and penned it long
a goe, when he sayd: I wil chant the
mercies of the Lord for euer. For to this
purpose IESVS the prime Christ,
records his ancient loues to the humane
hart, and now mixing with admirable
skil flats with sharps, sharps
with flats, the tenour with the base, and
running diuersly diuisions he touches
with a sweet reme^brance now vvith
a moderate, novv remisse, now slow,
and novv vvith a quick voyce, the
innumerable number of his benefits
vvhere-vvith heretofore he hath
vvooed the hart: Wherefore recording
things in this manner, novv he
stirres vp pious desires, vvhich he
had often enkindled before, novv
vvith a grauer tone, he exaggerats
the horrid feares of sinnes, and hel,
vvhich he not rarely had inculcated
heretofore, and novv againe vvith
a sharper streyne of the voyce, cal he

to mind the liuely and sudden impressions
of compunction for sinnes,
the agitations and excitations,
of the mind, determining a change
of life, nevv vndertakings of great
things, heroical entreprises, and a
thousand other of the sort; vvith
vvhich diuine loue is vvont to play
and dully in the harts of louers.
Meane vvhile the Angels tune their
instruments and strings to this argument,
and while themselues for astonishment
cannot open the mouth
or expresse a word; they betake
them to their instruments, and apply
al the industry and art they haue to
play vpon them, and with a sacred
silence, tacitly admire the diuine
mercy towards men, and euen with
the gesture of this dumb admiration
most vehemently stirre vp and incite
themselues to magnify and extol the
praises of God to the Heaue^s! whose

manner is and cheife delight, to rescue
mortals from the iawes of hel,
to put the burning coles of diuine
loue the cold, tepid, and slouth ful
minds, and with water as it were
to extinguish the flames of libidinous
lust. Lastly with one glance or
cast of the eye, as with a thunderbolt
to ruine and depresse the proud
and haughty and for the humble
and modest, with the only beck of
his wil to raise them sudenly. But
what doth the hart while, in whose
musike roame is al this harmony
made? Now it dilates it-self, now
contracts, now it riseth, now fals,
it feares, it hapes, it loues, it hates,
it composeth and wholy frames itself
and al it's appetites to the rules,
numbers, and sweet modulation of
musike.
Then truly it obserues and clearly
discernes the difference between the

celestial, that true, stable, melodious
musike, and the false voyces, the
harsh, the trembling, the broken, and
vngrateful tunes of the world. For
tel me I pray, what is that bewitching,
or, as you cal, delicious musique
of the world, but confusions of
B^bel, mad baulings, stra^ge clamours,
vnquoth noyses? One sings the perilous
tops of dignities, the smokes of
honours, the vncertaine degrees of
Magistrates, the vayne breath of popular
glory: another with a sordid
mouth sounds for the obseene and
foule delectations of the flesh, bestial
delights, wine, feasts, and banckets:
another sings outrage in's angers:
another with a fayned voyce
dissembles, choler and rancour, harbouring
within. Some like rather to
flatter, as Syrens, some with singing
to plot and coner guile and deceit
Thus are al the songs of the world

but a hydeous and tumultuous noise,
no harmony; inarticulate and hoarse
murmurs, no musike; or if a harmony
it be, it dulles truly as wel the hearers
as singers; and euen kils with
the very absurdnes thereof, since
peace indeed cannot rest with the
wickedIsa. 48. nor any quietnes be
among tumults, nor tranquility, nor
calmes, amidst the black, and hydeous
stormes and tempests of malice.
Whereas on the contrary, heauenly
musike delights the hart, wipes
away troubles and tediousnes, composeth
the euil motions of the sick
mind, repels the force of the enemies
lastly puts Sathan to flight, as heretofore
was signifyed in Dauid; who
restored Saul to his wits againe being
taken and vexed by an euil spirit,
with the only playing on a harp.1. Reg. 16.
Now therefore my hart (for now
remaynes thy part) sing a ioyful and

triumphant song. Io, liue IESVS
Victorious, liue he foreuer: liue
IESVS the triumphers, the terrour
of hel, and father of life. Liue IESVS
the Spouse of Virgins, the Doctour
of Prophets, the fortitude of Martyrs.
Liue IESVS Prince of Heauen
and earth, IESVS triumph,
the only possessour of my hart. Let
IESVS, I say, liue; raigne, and
triumph eternaly.


XIII. MEDITATION.

The preparatory Prayer.
Actiones nostras, etc.

FIRST POINT.
I Wil consider a triple musike,
wherof the first is heard in Heauen,
the second in earth, the third

in the hart of man, deuout to God.
The first truely, the Angels, frame
of three parts, the Cherubins, Seraphins,
Thrones, sing the treble, who
with a most high and shril contention
of the voyce, chant the diuinest
things, the eternity of God his immensity,
power, and the rest of the
diuine attributes. The Vertues, Dominations,
Principates, in a certain
midle tenour are occupied in proclayming
the mysteries of grace, the
Incarnation, of the Sonne of God,
his virginal Natiuity, Passio^, Death,
Resurrection, Ascention. Lastly the
Principates, Archa^gels, Angels, with
a graue and lower tone, sing the
creation and conseruation of the
world, and the rest of this kind.
4. Point. Attend now to the other
musike, made on earth, proclayming
the diuine prayses, which is the order,
symetry, and apt agreement of

al the parts of the world, with and
among themselues; in which Quire,
the foure elements with an harmon^ous
discord play their parts admirably
together. The Heauens likwise
make vp the consort, while
they declare the glory of God to
the whole world, for neither are the
words or speaches, whose voyces, may not
be hard.Psal. 18.
3. Point. The third symphony is
held in the Temple of mans hart,
and then is that melody made, when
al the faculties of the soule, contayne
themselues vvithin their
parts and functions; vvhen reason
playes the treble, the inferiour
appetite beares the base, when our
wii agrees with the diuine and
supreame wil: and such is the sweetnes
of this harmony, as fils he mind
with immense pleasure. And no
maruel, while IESVS hmself moderats

al this musike with his most
certaine and temperate rules and
measure.



THE COLLOQVY.
TO the blessed Spirits, whom I
wil inuite, first, to sing prayses
to the Diuinity: then wil I also
stirre vp my self to accommodate
my voyce with theirs: wherefore
with al the endeauour of my mind,
wil I sing with them this diuine
verse, Lord thy wil be done as in Heauen,
so in earth.
Pater. Aue.






IESVS THE SONNE
OF DAVID, PLAYES ON
the harp in the hart, vvhile
the Angels sing.

THE HYMNE.
VVhen IESVS doth my hart insp^re,
As Orpheus, with his tuned lire,
The trees with power attractiue drew,
My hart deep rooted (where it grew
In baren soyle without content)
So powerfully he drawes, that rent
From thence, it followes him, takes root,
And so self-loue, which had set foot
Is banished farre, who charm'd before
My hart deluded. Euermore
IESV be al in al, my part,
My God, musitian to my hart,
And harmony, which solace brings
Ah touch my hart, and tune it's strings.



THE INCENTIVE.
1. IF IESVS touch alone and
mooue affects, which are the
strings of our hart, good God! how
sweet, how diuine a musike he makes
therein. But if self-loue once
play the Harper, and medle with
the quil, and touch the springs but
neuer so litle, ah me! it is a hellish
horrour, and no musike.
2. When IESVS with a soft
modulation steals into my hart there
is streight such a sweetnes in the
marrow and bovvels, as al things
satisfy and please alike; life, death,
prosperity, aduersity: You vvould
verily say my miseries were charmed
by IESVS and his Angels.
3. Touch but the harp, litle
Dauid, giue it a lick vvith the quil,
tvvang that only, I say, tvvang the

domestical harp but neuer so ligh^ly,
whereon thy Gransier Dauid playd
so long a goe, and it is enough. It
was it dispersed the horrid clouds
of sadnes and melancholy, and draue
away the wicked Genius. O God,
when I heare this Dauid both father
and sonne of the Royal Psalmist,
playing on his harp, how my hart
iumps the while, yea how ready it
is to leap out of it-self.


THE PREAMBLE
to the Meditation.
THe heauenly Dauid in the midst
of the Hale of the hart, with
nimble fingers, tickles the harp, to
the musical numbers. Come hither
Angels, then come you deare soules
to IESVS, come you al: Cleare
vp your voyces, and tune them to
the pulse, and harmony of this harp.

This sound, beleeue me, wil banish
Sathan, and throughly purge away
melancholy, that grateful seat of the
wicked Genius.
But why the harp (most sweet
IESVS) rather then another? Yet
should I thinke thou takest it not
by chaunce: Vnles perhaps it be
that the forme and sound of this
Instrument. Ah! thou wouldst present
that figure which in mount Caluary
thou actedst so long a goe; playing
the Chorus of that sad Tragedy,
in the publike Theater of Heauen and
earth, in view of al? Ah, now I remember
how thine armes and feet
were then stretched forth on the tentours,
as in the harp the strings are
wont. How stiff were then the nerues
and sinewes of the whole body:
But here loue playes the harper, and
yealds so forth a sound most like the
harp, reaching farr and wide, as

farre I say, as the highest, midle, and
nether orb extend heauen, earth, and
hel. Sathan felt thee harper, and
maugre al his power was constreyned
to compresse his foaming anger,
and bridle his implicable fury. Death
lurking at the gates of hel, felt the
fatal point of his dart (being no
lesse then sinne) to be sudenly rebated.
But with vs now at the sound
of his harp, the rocks being riu'd and
split, began to fly asunder, harts
harder then adamants to soften,
wicked men touched with the prick
of conscience to confesse their crimes,
to knock their breast, the proper
seat of the penitent mind, and
to giue forth these words, most ful
of compunction, Truly the Sonne of
God was here.Mat. 27
Yea the sound went vp to Heauen
also; and sudenly stayed so the hand
of the diuine Nemesis, menacing

eternal ruine and calamity to men,
and now ready stretched forth to
make a ful reuenge of al, as that by
and by the same being voluntarily
vnarmed, and now as the case were
altered quite hath giuen place to
mercy, which hitherto had layne
hid.
But why doe I cal these things to
memory? who knowes my hony
IESVS, whether, with this harp
thou playest not some-what els?
What? I know not Vnles perhaps
with this sweet harmony of strings
thou, wouldst signify the sweetest
and sincerest pleasures, wherewith
thou woest and courtst the harts of
pious men. For who are able to expresse
with what deliciousnes of thy
pleasing tunes thou recreatst now
and then, and erectest minds afflicted
with the irksomnes and tediousnes
of a wretched and miserable life?

And for that we seely men, are altogether
vnable, goe on, o you Angelical
spirits, and here sing againe a
new mottet of thanksgiuing in our
behalfe.
But you get you hence and farr
enough, you glosing dangers foule
Sirens: Get you hence vncleane wicked
and deceiptful world: I hate
your rimes, your idle sonnets; for
your, musike lines are nets, your
notes, snares, your voyce the foulers
whistle. I curse and detest these
cunnings tricks. Your bals and
reuels are the Theaters of impudent
and infamous scenes; I execrat and detest
these Masks and mummeryes.
Therefore, o my hart, listen I
pray, and when thou hearest the
voice of thy God, anon being struck
as it were and smil, giue a sound
with al, and attemper and ply thy
voyce to his, make his wil and mine

to iump and sympathize together:
take heed thou yealdst not a rustike
musike; and a harsh vngrateful tone;
sing to the numbers right, and dance
with al whether aduersity maane
thee, or prosperity play with thee.
But especially lend thine empty eares
to the most sweet ditty of the
diuine Harper: who sweetly allures
thee a farre of, and neerer hand puls
thee vvith the sound of his harp.
Come, for so he sings, come my freind
come and thou shalt be crowned with the
head of Amana, with the top of Sanir
and Hermon; from the lions dens, from
the hils of Libbards.Cant. 4. Take here the
crowne of flowers, which thou hast
wouen for thy self, fetched from the
highest and steepest mountaines tops
not with out much labour and sweat
receiue the reward of the trauels and
combats, which thou hast fought:
the prize of the victory vvhich vvith

taming and binding the lyons and
beares, those vnruly beasts of thy
passions thou hast most gloriously
purchased. This harmony of IESVS
singing to the hart, my soule, vvil
procure there light, and gentle sleeps
and imbue the vvhole breast vvith
the nectar of diuine consolations,
that thou maist not feele the acerbity
of molestations, vvhich are
necessary to be drunke by mortals.
Strike out therefore thy harp most
strongly, my beloued, there shal no
murmure at al obstreperate and dul
thine eares; the closet of my hart is
vvholy vacant, that naught might
hinder the svveetnes of this harmony.
And you againe good Angels,
tune your voyces to the sound of this
harp, and I the vvhile from my immost
bovvels vvil sing these verse of
the Psalmes I wil blesse the Lord at al
times, his praise be alwayes in my mouth.

Psal. 33. For he hath taken compassion on me
of his great mercy, he hath blotted out my
iniquities.Psal. 50. He hath deliuered my
soule from death.Psal. 55. He hath crowned
me in mercy and good workes, He hath
replenished my soule in good things.Psal. 102.


XIIII. MEDITATION.

The preparatory Prayer.
Actiones nostras quesumus, etc.

FIRST POINCT.
COnsider how easy and expedit
is the contemplation of spiritual
things, when IESVS borne of
the true stock of Dauid, playes the
harper, in the hart, and with the
sou^d of his diuine instrument driues

away the wicked spirit; euen as heretofore
his great Grandsier Dauid,
restrayned the intemperance of Saul.
Attend besides how seriously the
Angels accommodate their voyce to
the sound of the harp; that euen
looke what they see IESVS to doe
for our good, they endeauour to doe
also, studying to accommodate
themselues to our occasions.
1. Point. Consider IESVS hanging
and nayled on the Crosse seemed
to haue caryed the figure of a
harp with him, which being playd
on, gaue forth as it were seauen
sounds, very ful of hidden mysteries
and the first stroke truly of his mystical
harpe was: Father forgiue them,
for they know not what they doe.Luc. 23.
When he held vp and staid the making
of the world from falling,
being then on the point to demolish
quite, and with it's ruine ready to

swallow the impious Parricides of
God. But, o most vnlucky stroke?
in the last streyne a string broke and
snapt asunder, and the soule and body
of the most blessed IESVS being
dissolued, the whole harmony of
Dauids harp was vtterly marr'd,
which yet a litle after the parts being
resumed and handsomely vnited together,
so newly raysed againe sung
forth a triumphal song.
3. Point. Consider when IESVS
is present what great festiuityes are
made, what diuine rayes doe shine,
what plenty of graces are powred
forth, and what true and solid pleasures
abound: but in the contrary
IESVS being absent what hydeous
darknes ouer-casts the minds, whole
squadrons of calamities, troubles,
desperations, feares, mourning, tediousnes
slouth, molestations, and
what not? come rushing in by troops.




THE COLLOQVY.
SHal be directed to the Blessed
Virgin, of whom, with the greatest
endeauour of an earnest and submisse
mind that may be, I wil craue
leaue that what she led before, I
may sing after her: My soule doth magnify
the Lord,Luc. 1. especially since
the benefits I receiued from her
sonne are likwise infinit;Psal. 116. and I wil further
inuite not onely the Angelical
spirits to sing; but al created things
whatsoeuer, with that Psalme of
Dauid: Praise the Lord al you nations.
Pater. Aue.






IESVS RESTS IN
the louers hart.

THE HYMNE.
BEhold my hart doth Christ enclose,
While he doth sleep I doe repose:
As I in him, he rests in me.
If he awake, I needs must be
The cause, that made the noise within;
For nought disquiets him but sin.
But I with crosses, soon am vext.
With iniuries and cares perplext,
And I, who should my wil resigne,
Am soone disturb'd greiue, fret, repine:
Til IESVS doth his grace impart,
Who giues repose vnto my hart;
O happy hart, with such a guest,
Which here hath what he giues thee, rest.



THE INCENTIVE.
1. SO long as the hart in God, and
God rests in the hart (which
is wrought with a holy consent of
wils) let the Heauens thunders and
lighten, the earth quake, and moue
out of its seat, the elements tumult,
the winds of temptations rage and
make a hurly-burly; yet the hart
shal be quiet and laugh at al.
2. When thou hast receiued
IESVS, taking the venerable Sacrament
of the Eucharist, take heed
thou awake him no^ deliciously sleeping
there, either with the hydeous
noise of outrageous choler, or with
the obstreperous clamour of the
other passio^s, or by any other way of
breaking silence, so much as with
the hu^h only.

3. But doe thou sleep, my litle
IESVS, and (as thou lists thy self)
take thy rest, in Gods name: We
make thee a couch ready in the hart,
we intend to loue none but thee we,
wil neuer breake our faith with thee;
though the winds bluster and seas
rore neuer so much.


THE PREAMBLE
to the Meditation.
I Sleep and my hart wakes:Cant 5.
It is the voyce of the most louing
IESVS. Whist therefore you
Heauens, earth hold your peace.
IESVS sleeping in the bed of the
hart, sweetly rests. You bustle in
vaine, o restlesse winds. The hart
where IESVS takes his rest is safe
enough the ship is now in the Hauen,
which the Master-hand of so
diuine a Pilot guides. Cease Aquilo,

Ah thou cold, gelid, cruel stranger
of the North; bridle thy most ominou^
blasts, for thou exhausts and
dryest vp the riuers of celestial graces
freesest the harts of men, with a
slouthful yce, and nigh killest them
with cold; thou strippest the trees
of fruit and leaues, makest the earth
euen horrid with hoary frosts and
winter downes, dashest the tallest
ships and the best man'd, and sinkest
them in a fatal gulf.
Cease thou Southern enemy,
Stormy Auster, froward, hot rhewmatike
(and which is worse) thou
incentiue and fire-brand of lusts,
bridle thy fatal breath wherewith
thou burnest al things, stirrest humours,
extinguishest the fires of diuine
loue; sprincklest the nerues and
synnews, dishartnest minds, and
makes them languish.
And doe thou cease likewise,

sweeping faune or scourer of the easterne
coasts, thou fatal Affrican
not only familiar with tempest, but
ful of a pestilent and blasting breath
thou rusflest here in vaine, thou
shalt neuer shake this hart, wherein
IESVS takes his rest.
But thou the fauner of the Eastern
sunne gentle Eurus, whether
thou wouldst be called Subsolanus
or Vulturnus rather, who art
thought to blow the winds of a fauourable
and smiling fortune, remoue
those insolent blasts of thine.
For the hart intentiue to diuine
things, and al enflamed with loue,
heares and attends thee not.
Now come I then to thee, my
litle IESVS, tel me, goe to, what
slumber, is this, which refreshed
thy weary body with so gentle a
shower of vapours? Thou being
once tired in the heat of the day,

satest at the fountaine, attending the
poore Samaritan, womanIo. 4 with
whom, as the antient Iacob, with his
Reb^cca, thou struckest a new contract
of mariage. Again els-where
being broken with toyle of trauelling
sherwd iournyes, thou gottest
to the mountaine tops about the
shutting in of the dayLuc. 6. to refresh
thy wearied limmes with a short repose,
when presently hauing now
hardly begun to enter into prayer,
thou wast faine abruptly to break it
off. But what sleepst thou here now
for. Nor doe I thinke thou art so
drownd in sleep, or so idle is to meditate
on nothing: If thy loue deceiue
me not, I should verily beleeue
thou now reuolu^st in mind that sacred
mariage which thou one day
wast to contract with the Church,
thy immaculate Spouse, at that most
happy tree of the Crosse, when the

sleep of death should bind thee both
hand and foote, and from thine open
side that other Eue should yssue
forth, as once the forme Eue had
done our common Parent, who sudenly
arose, so built of the bone of
Adam, cast into that prophetical
and extatical sleep.Gen. 2. Or whether
art thou not perhaps voluing and
reuoluing many things within thee,
studing and contriuing with thy self,
what dowry to make thy new
Spouse, and peraduenture thinkst
vpon the ornaments and dressings
for her head, earings, bracelets, carkanets,
and wedding robes, al embrodred
with the richest gemmes
with such like nuptial honours, and
presents fit for Spouses? Or thou
designest, who knovves? the forme
perhaps and solemne tables of Matrimony,
vvhich hereafter in the publike
Theatre of the vvorld; thou

art to celebrate vvith the Church
and the holy Soule. It may be thou
considerest vvhat her pouerty is, and
vvant of al things, and vvhat the rest
of al her goodly stock of miseries;
or vvherein only she is richly furnished
and abundantly vvel stored.
Or perhaps thou thinkest of yet
more ful and happy things then these,
which here thou dreamest on, while
thou sleepest. For in those ge^tle slumbers;
thou takest in the humane hart,
thou now plottest perhaps in mind,
the immense glory thou wilt affoard
the soule with a prodigal hand, who
shal haue the grace to receiue thee
courteously indeed. This doubtlesse,
thou handlest, now voluest, reuoluest
destinest, and designest.
O great Iacob, while thou slept'st
so, with thy head resting on a hard
stone, what strange, what diuine
things there didst thou b^hold! And

how many Angels were shewed thee
on that ladder going vp and downe,
so pitched on the earth and reaching
vp to heauen. Iacob (as we haue in
the sacred history)Gen. 28. flying the
more then deadly hate and fury which
his brother Esau bare vnto him, came
to Luza where he made a stone his
pillow, lying on the bare ground, in
stead of a soft and easy bed, and behold
he saw a ladder fixt on the
ground extended to heauen, God
leaning on the top thereof, and the
Angels ascending and descend^ng to
and fro: when being astonished and
amazed thereat, he cryed out. The
Lord is truly in this place, how terrible
this place is! And presently annointed
it, and set vp an Altar in the place
in al hast gaue thanks to the Diuinity,
and put the name of Bethel to it.
O litle Iacob! O most louing IESV,
rest in my hart a while (if it trouble

thee not too much) though indeed
it be but a hart lodging, and thou
hast but a stone for a pillow and bolstre
only, yet surely it wil be soft
enough, as soone as thou shalt but
powre theron the oyl of thy mercy.
Let the hart then so daily consecrated,
be called Bethel, that is the house
of God. The house of vanity! Ah
neuer be it sayd. But rather stre^gthen
it my God, be sure thou found it wel,
least the winds of inconstancy and
tempests shake it. But stand it rather
immoueable as the rock of
Marpeia in the midst of the sea dashed
with the waues and scornfully shaking
them off.



XV. MEDITATION.

The preparatory Prayer.
Actiones nostras, etc.

THE PRELVDE.
A Great storme was made in the Sea,
so as the ship was euen couered ouer
with waues; but he slept.Mat. 18.
1. Point. Consider the nest where
in the holy soule should liue and
dye, is the thorny crowne of the most
louing IESVS; for this sticks so
deep into the crowne of the sacred
head of the Spouse, as none may pul
it off; and so is as safe being and a
firme peace: and therefore wil I sing
with the most holy Iob: I wil dye in my
nest, and like to the Palme wil multiply
my dayes.Iob. 39. And I wil alwayes
cause, I say such a new increase of

merits in me, as there shal no day
slip wherein I adde not some line
or other to the absolute pourtrait of
vertue and sanctity
2. Point. The bed wherein IESVS
loues to rest, is the hart of pious
men, and dedicated to his loue. If
IESVS lodge but there, though
he sleep the while, al things goe
wel and rest quietly; and it were to
no purpose to feare any winds, stormes,
or thunders there. For the
waues dashing thereon doe but only
foame and no more, against the
rocks of Epirus; then breake in their
retire and soone after come to nothing.
3. Point. IESVS resting in the harts
of Martyrs, makes them so generous
and stout as they can equally endure
the torments of fire, and water: and
no meruail; for while IESVS takes
but his rest there, he giues them rest.

So when we admit IESVS by receiuing
the Sacrament of the Eucharist
into the lodging chamber of our
hart, there is nothing can trouble vs
or disturb vs because IESVS is there
who is our peace.Rom. 16. Ephes. 2.



THE COLLOQVY.
SHal be directed, to the most sublime
and diuine Sacrame^t of the
Eucharist: First extol its force and
power, which at that time we feele
in our selues. For the soule which
receiues and retaynes IESVS in her
house, how stout, how generous,
how constant she becomes! Then
inuite IESVS that he would often
deigne to lodge in the Inne of thy
hart, and there securly take his rest.
But beware thou awakest him not

in his sleep, nor euer suffer the noyse
of the world, and commotions of
the mind to make any tumult there,
or that any idle words (for the least

IESVS VVOVNDS
AND PIERCED THE
hart vvith the shafts
of loue.

THE HYMNE.
THe Diuels Archer, Erbinger
Of lust blind Cupid did appear,
But durst not stay to bend his bow,
He saw the hart with arrowes glow,
Which made him slinke away the chast
And spotles hart he cannot blast,
Which being cleans'd from sinne, is shut
From that blind hoy, whose only but
Are harts polluted, without white.
Behold the wou^ds Christ makes, delighte
See where the Angels pointing stand,
Giue ayme, by lifting vp their hand;
Or rather while the shafts ahound,
Wish they had harts that he might wou^d.



THE INCENTIVE.
1. MY good Archer shoot, Ah
shoot againe! shoot through
this hart of mine, with a million
of shafts, this refractory and rebellious
hart to thy diuine loue: slay and kil
al loue, which is not thine, or is aduersary
to it. O sweet wounds! o
deare to me! o arrowes dipt and
tipt with hony.
2. And thou my hart, reuenge
those iniuries so sweet, so acceptable,
and for thy part also shoot thou
againe into the hart of IESVS with
a thousand shafts, a thousand pious
loues, a thousand bals of fiery loue.
3. The hart is neuer in so good
plight as when it is transfixed with
a thousand points of sharpest loue
and paine; so that the true loue of
IESVS casts but the flames where
with I pyne, I burne with loue.



THE PREAMBLE
to the Meditation.
BVt what a Gods name dost thou
here, thou Pander Cupid? Art
thou so brazen faced as to presume
to abide where my loue IESVS is?
Come hither you good Angels,
thrust forth this wicked brat of that
Cyprian strumpet, out of doores.
Break his quiuer, snap his shafts a
sunder. For what a shamelesse impudence
is this and saucy boldnes,
of that blind elf, that such a cowardly
Iack as he should not quake
and tremble at the aspect; yea euen but
the shadow of my Lord IESVS; dreadful
to heauen and earth But; o powerful
arrowes of thy bow my Chaster
Cupid! my delight! my IESVS!
In the Northeren seas they tel of a
flowing Iland, which stands stil and

as it were, casts ankour as soon as
shot into with burning shafts, enkindling
fire as they fly. I beleeue
it: For loe thy fiery shafts, very sudenly
stay and arrest the ankored
barke of my hart, sayling in its ful
course, and euen now most miserably
floating in the midst of the sea
of the world. O loue I say not blind
as he! For how directly shoots he at
the marke, how dexterously and
ready he discharges, and how powerful
his shafts! Wherewith when
S. Augustine was touched and wounded
once he cryed out:Lib. 9. Conf. c. 2. Lord thou
shottest into our hart, with thy charity,
and thy word we bare transfixed in our
bowels. But the time shal come, my
doughty warriour, when from the
diuine bow of thy humanity bent
and stretched on the Crosse; thou
shalt snake and brandish seauen
speares of perfect victory, true

symbols of the foyling, and vtter
ruine of the enemy. For as the Prophet
Elizeus setting his ha^d to King
Ioas his bow, blessed the arrow,
with these words: The shaft of saluation
of the Lord and the shaft of saluation
against Syria.4. Reg. 13. so thy Diuinity
susteyning the humanity, impressed
a certaine more diuine force into
those seauen last words of his wherewith
like bow and arrowes they
might trouble, dissipat, and quite
transfix the hellish legions. For
there truly are those shafts whereof
once the royal Prophet sung: Thy arrowes
are sharp, people shal fal before
thee; into the harts of the Kings enemyes.
Psal. 44. O holsome blow! O happy
chance! O admirable force of arrowes!
For loe, the same both cure
the crowned, and deeply wound those
who seeme in their opinion to be
whole. Goe to then, be thou my

hart the scope and bute, stand to it,
why shrinkst thou? stand I say, and
stoutly take the shaft of loue into
thee. Yea doe thou shoot too, retort,
and wound againe. And be
thou likwise as a heauenly bow: and
doe thou stretch and streyne thy self
with al thy nerues as much as thou
canst. Let thy sighes and vowes
shot like thunder-bolts and winged
darts, freely mount vp the throne of
God himselfe. But first be they fired
with thy heat; that they may fly
the swiftter: adde also flames,
begg'd and fetched from heauen, and
as the most louing IESVS is al
fire, al loue, so doe thou kindle fire,
burne, loue, breake into sighes,
with frequent sobs, which reaching
vnto God may instantly reuerberate,
and returne to thee againe, and draw
forth bitter teares from thee in great
abundance.

But thou, o incomprehensible
loue, diuine spirit who so shadowest
and sittest on the hart as heretofore
in the first creation of things thou
didst, when hatching the world
from the rude, confused, and indigested
Chaos thou conuerted, so
that vast abysse of waters;Gen. 1. with
the heauenly dew of thy graces, temper
the flames of the boyling hart.
For my hart like wax molt with
the fire; with the sweet extasy of
loue euen liquefyes with al, and so
may I liquefy stil til I liquefy and
melt away for altogether. Goe to
then, with the finger of thy charity,
expresse in me the liuely forme and
image of thy loue, that after in my
bowels I shal kindle, and take fire,
and thou with water as it were shalt
quench or temper the same, that
there may be nothing found in me
but diuine dewes, celestial flames.

Let this fire then burne and encrease
in the midst of waters; and
the fire of concupisce^ce being vtterly
quenched, may these purer flames
liue and eternally burne my
hart, which neither the waters of
tribulations, nor the roaring waues
of temptations, nor any violence of
sicknes, nor the Scilla of calumniating
tongues, nor the gulfs of blasphemous
mouths, nor lastly the furious
Charibdes of any punishments
may euer extinguish it, for endles
Ages.



XVI. MEDITATION.

The preparatory Prayer.
Actiones no^^ras, etc.

THE PRELVDE.
THou hast wounded my hart* with
thy loue: sayth, the beloued
Spouse to her Spouse, in the burden
or holding of her song.Cant. 4.
1. Point. Consider the hart to be
like to that Iland they say to be
continually caryed and posted here
and there, with the waues of the
northern sea, nor euer to rest til touched
with burning shafts: so are
mens harts being tossed with the
tempests of diuers concupiscences,
nor can be staid or kept in, but touched
and struck with the dart of diuine
loue. Hence that saying of S.

Augustine being once caryed away
with the vogue and wind of euil affections
and now ceasing from the
course of his former impieties, Thou
hast shot our hart, my God, with thy
charity.Cant. 4.
2. Point. Consider the blessed felicity
and happy state to be wished
for of the hart,2. Cor. 13. as wel wounded
with the loue of IESVS as dying of
the wound. For this is a kind of
death whereof the Sonne of God
himself and his holy Mother dyed;
and which al pious soules are wont
to dye of.
3. Point. Attend to what are the
motions and exultations of the hart,
touched with diuine loue. Charity
(saith that great Coripheus of the
Quier of IESVS his louers] is patient
benigne, not enuious, or seeking
its priuate comodities.




THE COLLOQVY.
SHal be directed to the Angels,
beseeching them to driue away
Cupid that infamous princock boy,
that lewd stripling, to knap his arrowes
asunder, and to burst his quiuer,
that he may neuer more come
neere my hart, or offer any violence
to it.






THE HART ENFLAMED
WITH THE LOVE
of IESVS shines al vvith
light and flames.

THE HYMNE.
COme Moyses to the bush, draw nere:
Now God Incarnate doth appeare,
Man's hart the b^^^sh (cease to admir^^^)
With flames of loue (...) sets on fire.
See here the scoriching flakes and f^me
of pr^^er, which burne and not consume,
But only drosse of sinne. Behold
A hart refi^'d of tryed gold:
A Bush wherin loue so contriues,
That IESVS, Phenix-like reu^ues,
Amidst sweet aromatike sents
A bush wherin one that contents
Is al in al. And now though rare
One bird in bush is better farre.



THE INCENTIVE.
1. THe whole hart is al on fire
these flames then either come
from heauen; and deriue from IESVS,
or al these fires are sprung from hel
and lewd desires. Ah my litle soule!
Why art thou so in doubt? Deliuer
thy whole hart to IESVS, that he
only may enflame it with the fires
of diuine loue.
2. Behold his hands, feet, hart,
eyes, face, the whole body: IESVS
is nothing els but fire, naught but
litle flames of loue, whatsoeuer he
doth, speakes, suffers, breath but
loue, and that the loue of thee.
3. O loue! o sweet loue! o flames
of loue! Ah burne this hart I
pray. Yea my soule, doe thou burne
thee to ashes too in the loues of my
IESVS; and in these sweet flames,

may it liue, dye, reuiue againe, like
another Phenix.


THE PREAMBLE
to the Meditation.
IESVS was on the top of mount
Thabor, in the friendly company of
S. Peter, Iames, Iohn, Moyses and Elias;
Mat. 17. when sudenly his face began to
shine like the sunne, his garments to
be as white as snow, and the hil itself
to glitter al with flashing rayes,
flowing from his countenance. But
when Moyses heretofore ascended on
mount Sinay, to receiue the law of
God in stony tablesExod. 29. the people
beheld al the place to be set on fire
to sparkle, to burne, to shine al
ouer. Lastly Elias chariot4. Reg. 2. the
fiery sword of the Cherubin, watching
at the gate of Paradise,Gen. 3. the
foure beasts of Ezechiel,Ezech. 1. and al

furniture about them, seemed not
onely to shine, but to burne also. But
what-said the Spouse of her beloued
and his chast loue? His lamp, said she,
are lamps of fire and flames; many waters
were not able to extinguish charity.Cant. 8.
O fires and liuing flames euen in the
midst of flouds of waters! This is
the fire which encloses the hart so,
and sends forth such radiant and refulgent
rayes, as banishing al darknes,
al things shine and burne both
within and without. Of this lamp
mercy is the oyl; and that truly indeficient,
as flowing from an inexhaustible
chanel, the very bowels of
God. This is that wal of fire, which
God had prouised by the Prophet,
Zach. 2. which being interposed; the
lyons creast would fal, the enemy be
forced to turne his back, and he be
smit and strucke with a thunder-bolt,
who should once goe about to set

there to his sacrilegious hand. But
of al these wonders, this is most to
be wondred at, that as the greene
bush amidst the purest flames did
burne vntouchedExod. 2. and impeached
a whit, and God himself was heard
to preach therein, as in pulpit; so the
hart encompassed al with flames, and
therewith round beset, most consta^tly
alwayes burnes and is not consumed,
but euer shines and flasheth
ligth, since IESVS raises and resuscitates
those fires, and feedes the immortal
flames. Marke here, how
high the smoak of these fires mounts
vp to heauen. Goe to then, come
hither with your thuribles and incense:
How nigh in a moment the
incense of such fires sends forth most
sweet odours to Heauen! How speedily
the vowes and prayers commen.
ded to this fume, arriue at the throne
of heauen! The Heauens with this

exhalation shal breath forth Nectar:
The ayr repurged shal sauour sweetly,
the threats and rage of Deuils
shal expire; for indeed they can
no more endure these odours, the
grunting snowts of swine abide the
breath exhaling from the sweetest
smelling lillyes; and therefore shal
they be enforced to fly away, and
returne againe into the immost and
most hidden receptacles of Hel.
This is the fire, this the flame,
which quenches the heat of concupiscence;
for as one nayle driues out
another, so the fire of diuine loue
expels and represseth the libidinous
flames of base and carnal loues.
Burne therefore my hart, o IESV,
the dearling of my soule, and let not
the oile of the lamp be euer wanting:
be this fire as a wal vnto me;Zach. 2. be it
as a sunne, and be this my chiefest
ambition, that I burne and be consumed

with this flame: Yea, and be
reduced into ashes; then those ashes
into a litle worme, and presently become
a new hart. O Metamorphosis
of loue! But first would I haue the
old be throughly tryed, in the litle
furnace of his loue, the drosse, and
al the dregs to be scoured thence,
and no humane and terrene lees to
be left behind, but meerly to take
a heauenly state vpon it: to liue a
spiritual life, to feed on spiritual food
to vse a spiritual tongue, to haue spiritual
feet and hands; yea diuine
cogitations and affections, and not
done by aspects only, but euen
Angelical. In summe may this hart,
thus purged and purified, giue forth
hereafter naught but a liuely and
euerlasting figure of a blessed immortality.
So then doe thou my
dearest IESV) here fix thy hart, at
last; dwel here in thy Palace; and

here shoot forth the glittering rayes,
of thy glory,


XVII. MEDITATION.

The preparatory Prayer.
Actiones nostras quesumus, etc.

THE PRELVDE.
I Came to send fire into the earth and
what would I els but haue it burne.Luc. 12.
1. Point. Consider how necessary
it is the hart enflamed with loue,
should mount vp and vanish into
vapours; and so great is the force
of this flame, as it ascends to heauen
streight, where it arriues without
impediment: nor hath the world,

without God, ought that can satiate
and replenish the bosome of the
hart.
2. Point. Consider, how subtle
and actiue the flame of diuine loue
is piercing, cleare, neuer idle, vnquiet,
impatient to beheld shut vp
in any other place then in the bosome
of the Crucifix; where as in a
furnace of loue, it purges and repurges
ouer and ouer, and receiues
new life and vigour againe.
3. Point. Note the matter and fuel
of this fire to be al those things
which Superiours enioyne, in the
execution whereof is manifestly discouered
what force there is in this
fire,




THE COLLOQVY.
SHal be directed to Christ whom
I wil seeme to behold with two
burning lamps in his hands: I wil
beseech him, to purge whatsoeuer
is vnperfect or vicious in me, and to
reduce the very hart to dust and ashes:
that a new may arise like a Phenix,
which after he hath laid downe
the spoyles or weedes of his mortallity,
resuscitates a new, and reuiues
againe from the tomb it-self,
more beautiful and a great deale
better.
Pater Aue.






IESVS CROVVNES
HIS DEARE HART WITH
Palmes and Laurels.

THE HYMNE.
THe restles hart, which heretofore,
Could not stand stil, but euermore
Was beating oft with throbs opprest
Til now could neu^r be at rest.
It was ambitious, now I find*
Naught could content th' aspiring mind:
Had honours, pleasures, wealth good store,
Yet euer craued, was seeking more:
Which shew'd there was yet somthing stil
Which this capacious hart might fil.
A triangle, the soule, hath three
Distinctiue powers. The Trinity
Is such, that fils it; rest is found,
Loe th' hart is quiet, new its crowned.



THE INCENTIVE.
1. YOu good Angels, weaue you
garlands with garlands, laurels
with laurels, and crowne therewith
the fortunate hart, which
then glories and triumphs most
when with Olympian study; and
labour of vertues and mortification
it hath gayned but this prize, for
reward, to deserue to be beloued of
IESVS.
2. O ioyful! O festiual day! wherin
we may behold and gather euen
from thornes and toyles the purest
roses; from sweat and armes, palmes
and laurels; lastly of spitle, vinegre
and clay immortal and eternal crownes:
which IESVS, himself plants
and fastens on with his owne hand.
3. What slookst thou then, o
poore hartland tremblest at the multitude

of euils, which enuirone thee
and beset thee round. Cast thine
eyes rather on the laurels which attend
thee after thy victory. For nothing
can breake or so much as
moue him whom the hope and expectation
of palmes erect susteynes.


THE PREAMBLE
to the Meditation.
GOe to, you Angels, goe to,
o blessed Spirits make hart with
your palmes and laurels, from your
posyes, weaue you garlands and
with them deck you vp the triumphant
hart, victorious now after so
many assiduous labours, Crownes
are sacred, free from thunder, priuiledged
from the heauens, and signifye
exemption and immunity.
Now the winter is passed away the showers
blowne ouer and quite vanishedCant. 2.

Now the lyonly rage of the sworne
and professed enemyes of the hart is
repressed, vanquished, and tamed: prouide
you eternal laurels, victorious
palmes, and giue them into the
hands of the most sweet IESVS
that he may settle on the hart, the
crowns or garlands so prepared.
The magnanimous King Dauid,
affecting much the fat and fruitful
oliue symbol of mercy, humbly prayes
Psal. 102. his hart, may be crownd
with diuine mercies. The penitent
MagdalenLuc. 7. and PeterMarc. 26. weeping
bitterly, resemble the Amaranth, an
herb which in the midst of waters
retaynes both its natiue bitternes
and perpetual greenes. The voluptuous,
worldly, and licentious men,
are wholy taken with roses, and lyl^ies.
Let vs crowne our selues say they,
with roses, before they wither be there no
^eadow which our luxury ru^nes not ouer.

Sap. 2. O Phrigian luxury? O wantonnes!
But now a dayes forsooth the
Princes and Potentates of the earth,
crowne not themselues so much
with golden diadems and prec^ous
stones, as load them rather. O ambition!
o pride! But what doth the
most sweet IESVS, I pray! he loues
the victorious palmes, with these
crownes he decks his dearest hart.
For they indeed haue truly merited
those glorious wreaths who haue
not only constantly opposed the hart
as a target to receiue the shafts approaching
of aduerse fortune, but
euen as daring the enemy more slow
to anger, haue scorn'd and derided
dead it-self. Surely the squadrons of
Martyrs, and Quiers of Virgins,
triumphing in Heauen cary Palmes
in their hands:Apoc. 10. howbeit the 24.
Seniours ware on their heads crownes
of goldApoc. 4. which through

their glorious conquests and set
triumphs by them made vpon their
enemyes they had purchased to
themselues. Blesse therefore the Lord
Psal. 102. thou holy soule, through whose
singular and especial fauour thou
hast atteined to the top of perfection
Praise thy LordPsal. 147. through whose
mighty power, thou hast walked and
trampled on the sands of the sea,Exod. 14. Iosue. 3.
crossed the Iourdan with a dry foot,
the people of harts incircumcized,
and enemyes professed, looking, on
the while, and gazing with amazment:
to whom so vanquished, thou
gauest lawes, and laidst perpetual
tributes on them, they being not
able any wayes to barre thee passage
into the land of promise and
^egion of Pal^st^n^. Blesse thy God
^hen o hart ful of Heauen, and al of
(...) And since now thou hast ob^ned
a certaine pledge of felicity,

an infallible hope, enter a Gods
name at thy pleasure, with a notable
and triumphant pomp into the
Capitol of the heauenly Hierusalem;
whereso many purple Kings triu^ph
as haue heretofore repressed their
lewd concupiscences, and the insolence
as wel of their interiour as exteriour
senses.
Ioyne thee to the inuincible Martyrs,
and keep among the Quiers of
Virgins; let the body be thy triumphal
chariot, which Saphirs and
Carbuncles, most precious iewels
embellish as with so many twinckling
starres. Let Clarity, Agility,
Subtility, Impassibility, those foure
dotes of the blessed body, be as so
many wheeles; and permit thy self
to be drawne wheresoeuer the diuine
spirit sitting on the coatch and
wheeles shal snatch thee, or fly thou
where thou wilt thy self, diuine loue

shal play the Coach-man? Besides
the Princes of darknes, sigh and
groane as thy runne before the
chariot whom thou hast vanquished
with the singular demission and
lowlynes of mind. Let death it-self
be constreined likwise to put on the
cheynes and follow after; since by
the death of Christ thou hast triumphed
vpon it also, weakned and broken,
and that already by the same
guide and wagoner as before. Let
the vanqui^hed world come in and
make a part of the said pomp; which
then thou stoutly trampledst vnderfeet;
when with a generous scorne
and loathing, contemning its wealth
and honours, thou madst no more
reckoning of its vast immensnes, insolent
cariages, and flanting promises,
then of a figure drawne in the
water, or Chimaera laboriously framed
in the folish shop of the phantasy.

Draw I say these ancient cruel
enemyes, now happily vanquished
and tamed wel loaden with cheines
and reproaches, before the oual and
triumphant chariot, that is, the rich
bootyes, noble spoyles, ample tropheyes
and victories atcheiued in
many warres. But especially haue
care that sensuality aboue the rest,
the chiefest part of the triumph, be
tyed and bound to the Chariot,
which with an heroical fortitude
thou hast conquered, and made more
like indeed to a dead then a liuing
thing, pale, meagre and of so feeble
forces as it may neuer after dare to
appeare in the field, or make any
resistance.
But now in warlike standards and
enseignes let the cityes and towers,
which thou hast ouer-throwne, be
painted; which kind, let the mad
tower be first set downe, which thou

had leueld with the ground, and let
al the complices and confederates
thereof, subdued and braught vnderyoke,
and so cheyned together be
led, as ambition, vanity, arrogance,
and the rest of those military troops.
Let another banner exhibit the
bloudy warres, to be read which
thou hast valiantly atte^pted, faught,
and the victoryes nobly atchiued
against luxury and rebellion of the
senses. Let those gallant exploits be
wouen here in silke, and waued in
banners, vp and downe through the
ayr as thou passest,; wherewith thou
hast mastered and tamed thy flesh,
that fierce and cruel beast. Let the
inuincible courage of thy mind be
here seen and read, as fasts, abstinences,
austerities mortificatio^s, wherewith,
as with a sword and buckler,
thou hast fought against this fierce
and mischeuous enemy.

Let the Stygian Pluto also, that
damned loue of riches, be caryed in
an other flag; whom long since thou
hast trod vnder-foot, in preferring
religious pouerty before al the treasures
of the world.
Let besides the dastard, weake,
and languishing slouth, sitting on her
snayl, come forth in this triumph,
which slow and sluggish beast, thou
hast stirred vp with the sharp prick
of generosity and diligence, and
beyond al hope prouoked and preuayled
with at last.
Lastly in a table, higher then the
rest, let this inscription be read, registred
in capital letters, for a record
and perpetual memory.
THROVGH THE HELP,
SVCCOVRS, AND MERITS
OF THE MOST LOVING
IESVS, HAVE WE FAVGHT,
AND VANQVISHED AND

ARE NOW CONVEYED
TO HEAVEN, TO TRIVMPH
THERE AMIDST THE
GLORIOVS PALMES
AND LAVRELS.
But now what remaines? forsooth
this last of al; that when thou shalt
consort thy self aboue, with those
24. Seniours, and Quiers of Angels;
thou lay downe thy crowne at the
feet of the immaculate Lamb,Apoc. 4.
chanting with those blessed Citizens
of Heauen this oual and triumphing
song: Benediction and clarity, and thanks-giuing
honour, vert^e and fortitude, to our
Lord for euer and euer. Amen.Apoc. 7.



XVIII. MEDITATION.

The preparatory Prayer.
Actiones nostras, etc.

FIRST POINT.
I Wil fayne my self to be armed at
the top of the Hil, whither I had
got with great endeauour, and much
labour and trouble. I wil cast and
reflect the eyes of my mind on the
diuers wayes and traces I had passed
thither; the precipices I escaped, and
the perils of assassinates and wild
beasts I haue auoyded: For so it is
indeed with such as haue attayned to
the top of perfection. For these
should attentiuely consider with the^selues
as from an eminent place, how
many and how great dangers, temptations,
and sinister chances, being

assisted by the diuine mercy, they
haue escaped from the world, and
al the rest of the enemies of mans
saluation.
2. Point. I wil consider the lawes
of these lifts to be such, that* None
shal be crowned but who haue lawfully
faught and conte^ded therein2. Tim. 2. The Palme
belongs but to the Conquerour:Apoc. 7. and I
wil admire also the goodnes of God,
for crowning vs himself with his
graces, and commanding the Angels
to crowne vs with those laurels,
which we haue purchased to our
selues with our owne vertues.
3. Point. I wil ponder and weigh
with my self, with what riuers of
ioyes the hart flowes, to whom is
affoarded to arriue to the top of diuine
loue, and who already beholds
his owne perseurance; which only
vertue makes vs blessed and secure,
without which the rest auayle but

litle, or nothing, for perseuerance
alone is it, which is crowned.



THE COLLOQVY.
SHal be directed to the most louing
IESVS, to whom of duty al our
crowns belong. For we are not conquerours
so much as vanquished,
while he indeed hath broken and
subdued our refractory and rebellious
hart. Wherefore to him as to
amost mightie conquerour, and victorious
Captain, with those 24. Seniours
in the ApocalipsApoc. 4. and 7. are we
to offer vp our crownes, palmes, laurels,
with this solemneverse of theirs;
Benediction and clarity, and thancks. gi-uing,
honour and vertue, and fortitude for
euer and euer be to IESVS the Conquerour
and triumpher to come. Amen.

IESVS CELEBRATES
THE HEAVENLY
Nuptials in the hart.

THE HYMNE.
THe nu^t^al supper, now I see,
O happy soule! prepar^^d for thee;
The table's co^erd: but what sea^,
Hast thou for thy repose? What meat?
Except a Lamb, I nothing find,
The amourous Spouse is now so kind,
That what ^e fed thee with before;
From th'eye shalbe conceal'd no more.
As with a fleece, in species white,
He long in earth appear'd in sight.
As with a fleece, by grace gaue heat:
But now behold the Lamb thy meat.
In ^im repose, freed from annoy
By seeing, comprehend, enioy.



THE INCENTIVE.
1. IESVS the bloudy Spouse or
Spouse of bloudExod. 4. leads his beloued,
whom now long since he purchased
with the price of his life, vnto
the Nuptial supper of the Lamb,
into the heauenly Bride-cha^ber. The
hart therefore (who admires not]
is the banqueting roome of these
Nuptials and the Bed-chamber of
the Spouse IESVS himself.
2. It is a supper truly, because
these ioyes are not affoarded til after
the toyles of the day and labours
past. Expect not lampes; here hanging
on sumptuous and precious
seelings: These Pallaces shine within,
and without sunne, moone, and
starres. The Lamb himself is the lamp
within,Apoc. 21. and he the banque^ Host,
and Ghest who is the Spouse.

3. Seest thou this royal Table here
These things are al prepared for
thee: Seekest thou daintyes? Hardly
are thy seen of mortal eyes. Such as
sit downe here are alwayes feeding,
they drinke without gluttony, are
alwayes satiated, and yet a-thirst,
without any loathing or irksomnes
at al. Behold al things are ready.
Come to the wedding, the Spouse cals.Mat. 22.


THE PREAMBLE
to the Meditation.
IESVS, receiues the soule, whom
he gratiously beheld, though
fowly dight with her immundityes
before, and now hauing cleansed
her with purging waters, and adorned
Ezech. 16. with feminine brauery, takes
her I say, not only to his Spouse,

Osee. 2. but if she keep her holily and
chastly to him, casting her out of the
most miserable banishment of this
life, he leades her vnto the great solemnity
of the Nuptials, into the
heauenly house of his Father: where
he tyes her eternally to him with an
indissoluble knot of wedlock. Whereto
belongs that sacred Epithalamium:
Let vs reioyce and exult; and
giue glory to him; because the Nuptials
of the lamb are come, and his Spouse hath
made herself ready, and she hath had
giuen her shining and wh^e silke to weare.
Apoc. 19. Yt is surely a great matter
to be reckoned of the family of the
King of Kings, more to be accounted
among his freinds and familiars;
but most of al to beheld the Sonne
of God, the brother and coheyr of
Christ: I wil speake more boldly
yet; this same is surely more honourable
then al these to be called in

the weding the Spouse or Wife of
the Lamb, that is, partaker in a manner
of his bed and bord, companion
of his throne and crowne. And this is
that honour if I be not deceiued,
which the Prophet Esay meanes:Isa. 56.
I wil giue then a place in my house, and
within my wals; and a better name then
sonns and daughters. For children being
but a slender part or portion of parents,
chalenge and retayne indeed
much of their right and substance
from them: but for man and wife, so
great is the society and community
between them of their whole life and
of al their goods and titles, and they
are bound together with so streight
a tye, as how farre so euer they be asunder,
yet are held to be as is were
in one place, and al one, which happens
also in the celestial wedlock of
IESVS with the soule. For who adheares
to God is in al one spirit with him,

as the Apostle1. Cor. 6. hath taught.
Whence it is, that the soule perfectly
vnited with God, is not only diuine,
but in a certaine manner (if I may
so say) is made God. And hence is
al (whatsoeuer it is, which is surely
very great) that dignity; profit, and
sweetnes of these nuptials. For looke
whatsoeuer els besides haue any connexion
with them, doe al euen flow
from thence, as from an endlesse
spring of al good and beatitudes; especially
those three, (to say nothing
of those of the body] to wit, the most
singular and eminent dotes of the
soule espoused and wedded to IESVS,
as Vision, Comprehension, Fruition:
S. Tho. 1. 2. q. 4. ar. 3. Which are not procured her either
of parents or nature it-self, but
being so poore a Spouse, are most
bountifully affoarded her by IESVS
the Spouse himself (as with Kings
is wont when they match with any

of low degree, most richly to endow
their beloued Spouses, by reason of
their nuptials had between them.
But in reguard these things of themselues
are greater then can be worthily
weighed by vs, much lesse expressed,
the diuine Scriptures, doe lightly
shadow at least and adumbrate in a
sort al the excellencies and delicious
fruits thereof, with the pleasant and
most apt figure (for our capacity)
of royal nuptials, and a wedding
supper.Luc. 14. Mar. 22. The reason is, for that
no noises of affaires and negotiations,
nor cares, which commonly fal out
by day, doe not trouble or disturb
the peace and delights of suppers; and
for the feasts of royal Nuptials, they
vse especially to be very curious and
dainty indeed, where no part of the
senses abounds not with exquisite
delights. Here the eyes are fed with
various Emblems of the tapistries of

the Hal most gallant to behold, with
the gorgeous apparel of the Ghests
and waiters also, with the gold of
the plates, and iewels of the whole
furniture there. Here the eares are
charmed with the artificious harmony
of musical instruments and voyces.
Here the sent most sweetly is perfumed
with the delicate odours of
flowers and herbs, and boxes ful of
the sweetest oyntme^ts: the palat seasoned
and relished with delicious wines,
and the daintyest viands; purchased
with the greatest study and
industry; and sought for farre and
neere by al the exquisit meanes that
may be deuised, and dressed especially
by the rarest Cookes. Lastly, to
the end the sense of feeling, the most
brutish sense of al the rest, might not
want it's peculiar delights also, the
touching hath its proper delectation,
from the softnes of downy beds, and

curious carpets, from the feathers,
and downe of swans and the like.
Let vs runne ouer a while, if you
please, the gardens and pictures of the
great Assuerus, that from that feast,
the royallest perhaps that euer was in
the memory of men, by ghesse at least
we may gather in some manner, what
a ba^quet it is, which IESVS furnisheth
forth in the hart of his Spouse.
He then, as wel, to shew the riches
of the glory of his Kingdome,
and the greatnes and the ostentation
of his power; as also in the third
yeare of his raigne, to celebrate publikely
the day wherein first he
tooke a perfect possession of Susa
the chiefe seat of his Kingdome, prepared
a Persian, royal, and a sumptuous
banquet. For first Assuerus
himself was the Master of the feast
and who was he? He raigned from
India to Ethiopea, from the East to

the West: and what more? He gaue
lawes to 27. Prouinces, appointing
so many Prefects and Gouernours
to them, who in the Kings
name might administer iustice. Assu^^^rus
therefore was a mighty and
most puissant King; yea truly he had
conquered and subdued to his owne
dominion the whole world,Ester. 1. if we
beleeue but his owne Epistle:Ester. 13.
though indeed I should thinke it
rather to be no more then a meere
exaggeration of insolent men, who
extending their bounds a litle wider,
vse to flatter themselues with the
Empire streight of the whole world:
But be it so as they boast of and make
their braggs, Assuerus yet shal seem
but a fly compared with God himself;
nor euer shal though he pusse
vp himself neuer so much, ariue to
the bulke and worth of an Elephant.
IESVS, the Master of this feast,

not only as God, but euen also as
man, is the Soueraigne and supreame
Lord of al things, in whose loynes
is written King of Kings, and Lord
of Lords,Apoc. 19. and at whose aspect and
tribunal comming to iudgement shal
Assuerus himself appeare one day,
yea tremble and groane the while.
The rest may likewise be gathered
by this: Yet if you please let vs suruay
them more perticularly that our
purpose and scope may appeare more
clearly.
Susa was not the head-Citty of
the kindome of Persia, but a pleasant
and most delicious Tempe, which
that riuer Coaspes washed as it went
a long; whose waters Kings, and
those very farre remote from thence,
made vse of for daintyest drink: and
for the amenity of the place; it tooke
the name of Lilly, which Susa signifies
in Persia. Here therofore they

reposed and lodged themselues, and
that truly in those royal and princely
gardens, wodds and grouesEster. 1. in
the Spring especially as we may beleeue.
Here not only the pleasant
variety of flowers and herbs made a
wanton daliance but euen of the
beautifullest trees also; in disposing
whereof in checker-wise, and distributing
the allyes, walks, and arbours
the royal hands themselues,
after the Countrey fashion, had labowred
to some purpose. But what
trow you was the rest of the garnishment
of this festiual Court Where
the Pauilions were of a costly and
rich stuffe; of cerulean, aetherean,
and of the colour of the Hyacinth,
whose curteynes hung with
strings of purple silk, fastne with
^^^inges made of iuory: at either end
these rich and stately Canopyes
were gallantly susteyned with marble

pillars; beneath lay humble pallots
on the ground a pleasant pauement,
to rest vpon al of gold and
siluer, streyed with the fayrest mantles
and rich carpets (as the 70.
Interpretours signify) wrought al
ouer, embrodered and curiously set
forth with needle-works of roses,
and diuerse other flowers, glittering
and beguiling the senses: besides al
which, the pauement it-self shined
al of a certaine square stone, and
that in quadruple wise; enterstinguished
with in the emerald, and
touch-stone, and (as the Hebrew
hath) with marble and Hyacinth
being certaine titles forsooth, diuersi^yed
al in an admirable manner.
And these for the most part were
p^^pared for the common Ghests;
for I should thinke those of the better
^^^t, were al entertained in the
i^ most lodgings of those Princely

Palaces, where with tapistryes and
pictures, were al the roomes and
lobbeyes sumpteously ha^g'd. Could
there be euer any thing either for
maiestie more royal and magnificent
or for luxury and delight more
soft and delicious? O childish toyes,
and meerly gugawes! O loose cogitations,
of the soule, euen bendingto
the earth! why creepest thou on
the earth, thou litle mush rump, and
pleasest thy self so much with these
trifles? Measure with the eyes of thy
mind at least, the vast immensnes
of the Heauens gaze if thou canst,
and behold the sunne, moone, and
the rest more then common people
of that starry house; which are but
onely outward ornaments: for those
within, farre different from them,
transcending not only the faculty of
the senses, but euen the agility of

the mind also are meerely laid out
of sight. Heare the mellifluous Bernard:
Bern. ep. 114. that same indeed is the
true and onely ioy, which is not of the
creature, but is truly conceiued of the
Creatour himself, and which being p^ssessed
by thee no man can take away from
thee: where to compared al pleasure otherwise
is but sorrow, al sweetes but bitternes,
al beautie d^formity. Lastly al
other things nought els but tedious and
irksome, which otherwise might seeme
more pleasing and delightful.
Now then, which is the other
point; looke we into the great Assuerus
GhestsEster. 1. and directours of
the feast. Of these I note two sorts,
some purple Heroes of tke Perseans
and chiefe Prefects of those Countreyes
and Prouinces 127. in nomber;
who al (leauing magistrates
of inferiours orders behind them in
their roomes, to take vp differences

accurring the while) flock to thy
City and Princely Court, to that great
feast: the other Ghests were the
common sort of the City of Susa itself,
from the highest to the lowest a
vast people vvithout head or certaine
number of them.
But for the ministers and vvaiters
there, I seeme also to behold tvvo
orders of them some Prefects of the
royal Palace; vvho as Stervvards,
V^^^hers, and Sevvers of the feast appointed
and placed the Ghests, prescribing
lavves and rules to them to
be kept amongst them; others to
execute lesser and inferiour offices,
as Butlers, Tasters, Cup-brearers,
and the rest of vvayters al: But if
compared vvith the Angels, as vvel
the Pages, and others of that diuine
table; as the bidden Ghests themselues,
or either vvith the number or
splendour, of the rest of the blessed

Citizens of heauen, those are but
dvvarfs; these Giants, those vvretches,
and for manners most co^monly
vvicked, these blessed and happy;
yea most holy these except a fevv,
an ignoble and base people, and
these not only most graue Senatours,
but Kings and Monarks al
vvithout exception.
Behold here the Queene-Mother
of God (to amit the Spouse himselfc,
behold, the Patriarks Prophets,
Apostles, Martyrs, Confessours,
Virgins, and al the rest of the
Court of Heauen, and let the Medes
and Persian Ghests alone. Yet
stil AssuerusEster. 1. vants and Boasts of the
bowels and dishes of his feast. Be it so,
let vs set downe the^ to eate and drink
our fil, for this is thesumme of al.
The dishes, plates, and trenchers,
are often changed; such is the multitude
and variety there, and store of

siluer gold, and other precious vessels:
For here they eat and drinke
also in gold, and cups made al of
ge^mes. As for the cups the Septuaginta
auerre there was one made
of Carbuncles, surely of a vast and
immense price, to wit, of thirty
thousant talents, which of our florens
comes to more then 101 millions.
Let no man after this speake
or wonder any more at the suppers,
excesse, costs of Cleopa^^^ra, L^^^llus,
or Heliog^balus. But what was the
meate now brought to the table?
The sacred Scriptures speake not a
word thereof for that perhaps al
might guesse then, if they would, as
wel by the Pe^^^sia^ pomp, very vsual
in those things, and now brought
into a prou^rb, as by the great
ostentation touched aboue of the
plates, cups, and dishes had in that
feast. What the drinke? Forsooth

the best forts, as became the royal
magnificence: there was aboundance
of al and the choycestibid. wines
that could possibly be had, but on
that condition that none should be
compelled to drinke more or lesse;
but euery-one haue liberty to drink
as much and as litle as he would.
Surely a holsome and laudable law
of the King. For this tyrannical order
of Let him doe reason or begone,
spru^g first no doubt from the Greek
Tauernes, of I know non what
Caldus, B^^^berius, or MeroCicero. lib. 5. Tuscul. But now
goe to, thou great admirer of the
Pe^^^sian banquet: vvhat account makest
thou of the gold, siluer, ievvels,
in those cups and dishes? This gold,
siluer, ievvels, beleeue me are but a
harder kind of earth, vvhereto the
sunne and starres haue giuen a colour
and some lustre; vvhereon I say, lest
auarice perhaps might set to great

a price, nature had vvissel hid them
in the vvomb or bovvels of the elements,
and these also vvhere they are
most in vse, and vvorne of al, become
but cheap, and of litle worth.
But for meats and drinks what they
are, appeareth then, when hardly
being let downe into the stomake
they are streight egested thence. And
wilt thou compare this filth, this
dirt [to say no worse) with the riches,
and delights of heauen, with
the Nuptials of IESVS with the
Euangelical supper, with the vision
of the diuine Essence, lastly with
those delights and inexhaustible
pleasures, which flow incessantly
from that ocean of the highest
good? The great lohn sawApoc. 6. and 21. this
table in his Apocalyps, and wondered
at it; the royal Psalmist saw it likwise,
and wholy astonished, exclaymed:
^hey shal be inebriated with

the plenty of thy house, and thou shalt
make them drink of the torrent of pleasure.
Psal. 55. But take here a litle this simple
tast therof. Al the goods of this world
are nothing els, but as rinds and springs
of the fruits of Paradise, cut off: and if the
rinds and springs be such that men euen
raie with the loue and d^sire of them, what
shal the fruits themselues be, and the apples
of Paradise it-self? and if such be
the fruits and apples; what shal the rest
be of those more solid and better meats?
Surely they shal be such as they may alwayes
be eaten without loathing, and alwayes
desired without anxietie.Bellarm. de fel. 88.
And now finally how long haue
these feasts of Assuerus lasted? A hundred
and eightye dayes at most; scarce
half a yeare, especially if we speake
of the feasts of the Peeres and Nobles;
for the co^mon sort^ continued
hardly a weeke in these transitory
delightes.

Take me here a hundred thousand
yeares, yea a thousand millions of
yeares of this Nuptial supper, which
IESVS furni^eth in the louers
hart, and you shal find no end of the
feast, which end yet, if you seeke
further, measure Eternity. As long
as Heauen and God shal be, these
Nuptials shal continue alwayes.
Not so, in this banquet of Su^a. For
(oh inconstancy of humane things!)
behold how in the tables of Assuerus
himself mourning occupies the last of ioyes.
Pro. 14. After the Persian King had wel
carroused, and now al enflamed with
B^^^cchus, deep in his cups, and thought
he had done but litle yet, if he
shewed not the Queene Vasth^, to his
Ghests; because the, either of pride
or modesty rather, refused to come
into the drunken presence of al
those Princes, by the King her husba^d,
she was fowly and ignominiously

intreated, in the very banqueting
roome it-self, weere she feasted with
her Ladyes, being thrust from the
royal throne and dignity, was refused
and reiected by him. Goe to
now, and praise the feasts and nuptials
of the great Assuerus, if you
wil; or rather be wise and admire,
and loue the celestial Nuptials of
the Lamb.



XIX. MEDITATION.

The preparatory Prayer.
Actiones nostras quesumus, etc.

THE PRELVDE.
BLessed are they who are cald to the
Nuptial supper of the Lamb
1. Point. Co^sider the highest dignity
(then which a greater ca^not be imagined)
as wel of the soule, in loue
which IESVS, which from an abject
and base condition is aduanced
to the Nuptials of God himself, as
of the humane hart, wherein these
diuine Nuptials are celebrated.
Whence comes it, O humane soule, saith
S. Bernard,Bern. ser. 2. de mut. aquae in vinum. whence happens this so
in^stimable glory to thee, that thou should^st
deserue to be his Spouse, on whom the
Angels wish to gaze? How happens this,

that he sho^ld be thy Spouse, whose beauty
the sunne and moone admire, at whose
b^ck are al things changed: What wilt
thou yeald to thy Lord for al he hath thus
afforded thee, to be his com^anion at table,
and compartener of his Kingdome; lastly
his bed-fellow, and to haue the King himself
to lead th^e into his chamber? And by
and by behold with what armes of
mutual charity, he is to be embraced,
and loued againe, who hath made
such reckning of thee; and at last:
forget thy people, and thy fathers
house: Forsake carnal affects, vnlearne
secular ma^ners absteine from
former vices, commit al naughtie
customes to obliuion.
2. Point. Weigh how great, sincere,
and solid, the pleasures, are
like to be, which the spouse prepares
for thee in the Nuptial supper:
suruey al things which vnder
heauen, are precious delightful, and

deare to men, in the ayr, earth, or
ocean Sea, and then reason with S.
Augustine thus: Is, my Lord, thou affordest
so much to vs in prison; what
wilt thou doe in the Palace? For since
here al things are so exceeding good and
delectable, which thou hast conferred on
the euil as wel as the good; what wil those
be which thou hast laid vp for the good
onely? If so various and innumerable thy
guifts are, which now thou equally distribu^est
to frends and enemyes, how great
and innumerabbe, how sweet and delect^ble
shal they be, thou wilt bestow on
thy freinds only! If in this day of teares
and mourning thou impar^st such things
what wilt thou doe on the nuptial day?
Hearest thou this my soule, and yet
exclaymest not? Blessed be he who
shal eate bread in the Kingdom of God.Luc. 14.
3. Point Attend to this also; how
of the ten Virgins of the Ghospel
Mat. 25. being al Virgins indeed, that

is, espoused to Christ through true
and sincere faith, and who had sometimes
pleased the Spouse in carying
lamps of good works in their
hands, fiue were become foolish, and
from the nuptials and wedding supper
on hard fortune! quite excluded.
Beware thou be not of their number
let thy lamp be alwayes burning,
and sending forth light; let
the oyle of charity abound in thy
lamp, and euen, flow ouer, and especially
take heed thou neuer sleep
or slumber a whit, nor be surprized
vnaware, suspecting nothing of
death, or iudgement, or be vnprouided.
Haue continually ringing in
thine eares, that voyce of thy Spouse
Vigilate, so often whispered in thy
hart, that when that cry shalbe heard
Behold the Spouse comes, goe forth and
meet him, thou maidst presently meet
him chearfully comming to thee,

and with him enter into the wedding.
For woe and a thousand woes
to them, who vnmindful wholy of
so great a good, and deafe to the
words of God, being taken napping
drown'd in sleep with their
lamps extinguished, and so excluded
from the sweetest nuptials of the
lamb, shal be forced to cry out in
vayne, Lord, Lord open to vs; on whom
that iron bolt shal be obtruded, I
know you not, or that wholy as lamentable;
The gate is shut.



THE COLLOQVY.
SHal be directed to IESVS the
Spouse. Especially thou shalt
yeald him thankes with al thy
powers, for choosing thy soule to
be his Spouse, for louing it so dearely

hitherto, and endowing it with
the espousal guifts. Then shalt thou
humbly beseech pardone of him,
for hauing so coldly answered to his
feruent loue, wherewith he hath so
often preuented thee; and sometimes
perhaps for breaking thy faith to
him so firmly engaged. Lastly by
that his loue, wherewith he hath so
of ten preuented thee, shalt thou
most earnestly beg at his hands, that
through his grace thou maist be
continually vigilant, and prouided
for that last Aduent, which is like
to be at mid-nigh, when perhaps
thou least suspectest the same; that
then thou maist meet him, with thy
burning lamp, and with the prudent
Virgins enioy him and his nuptial
feast for euer.Mat. 25.
Pater. Aue.





IESVS MANIFESTES
HIMSELF AND THE MOST
holy Trinity in the mirrour
of the hart.

THE HYMNE.
THe Painter cannot draw a face,
T' express to life each (...), grace,
And figure, with proportion fit
Except the partie d^owne doth sit:
But heer in th'hart by being seen,
God drawes the picture which had been
Before imperfect: though 'twere neat,
And often toucht, 'twas not compleat.
Til now, it lightned as vpon see,
True picture of the Trinity.
The colours stem'd did fak and eye,
But now sbal last eternally.
While heer the hart doth quiet sit,
By vision God doth sigure it.




THE INCENTIVE.
1. THe hart which loues God
truly and perfectly indeed, is
a heauenly Paradise; so flowers it
ouer and swimmes in delights; not
the counterfeit, and transitory delights
of this world, but of the other
life; such as here, neither eye hath
seen, nor eare hath heard, nor hath
ascended into mans hartRom. 8.
2. Here now IESVS stands not
behind the wal, peeping at this
Spouse through a grate;Cant. 2. but,
which she beg'd at his hands, shewes
her his face, the diuine Essence, the
three diuine Persons, so cleerly and
manifestly indeed, as euen the images
themselues expressed, reflect
againe in the Chrystal of the hart.
O Paradise! O delights! O ioyes!
3. The hart faints through aboundance

of loue and delights and nigh
bursts with al, O man! what a beast
thou art, if hearing of these pleasures,
thou rather choosest the husks
of swine? How like a block and
stone, if yet thou louest not IESVS?


THE PREAMBLE
to the Meditation.
SO great is the future beatitude to
the soule which loues IESVS
dearely indeed, that mortal men
being drowned in sensuality and mire,
cannot easily conceiue it in the mind,
nor lesse (without diuine light and
hope) expect it. For (which S. Paul
Rom. 8. took out of the prophecy of
Esay.Iza. 58. The eye hath not seen, nor eare
heard, nor hath it ascended into the hart
of man, what God hath prepared for such
as loue him. Surely those two most

wise and worthy men, to the end
they might clearely propose the
greatenes and amplitude of the heauenly
beatitude, assumed the first
kind of measure to wit the spacious
orbs of eyes seeming most capacious,
which though shut in a litle
corner as it were, yet now and then
get forth, wander and expatiate farre
and wide, not only, into the vast
champian fields, huge mountayne
tops, and the golden and gemmy
bowels of the waters, but with help
especially of Mathematike instruments
reach euen to the very heauens
themselues, wel nigh of an infinit
distance from vs, and therein
discouer the lightest spots* changes,
and errours. And yet this scantling
is found to be lesse then so to conclude
or comprehend beatitude.
The eye hath not seen.
Wherefore with the ^yes since we

only apprehend things present, but
with hearing moreouer as by histories
perceiue those thi^gs which haue
been formerly acted, or now are
wrought in any other place, or shal
hereafter come to passe, the eares
haue seemed more apt to measure
the thing proposed. But so neither,
the immensnes of beatitude could be
contained. Nor the eare hath heard.
There remained now the vessel, for
bulk surely not great, yet for capacity
indeed most ample, the hart of
man. For in the shop of the hart we
frame, cherish, and embrace, as our
proper issues, not only what our selues
haue seen, with our eyes, or heard
by relation from others but euen
many other things also, which can
not truly exist at al, as golden mountaines,
Chimeras, Hippocentaures,
and the like: And yet so neither,
hath it ascended into the ha^t of m^n,

what God hath prepared for such as loue
him. This thing according to S.
Augustin. Is not comprehended through
charity, it tra^scends as vowes and wishes.
Shal we therefore dispaire? No it cannot
be esteemed, it may be yet purchased
Goe to yet let vs value it, howsoeuer,
and as wel as beating the price,
let vs cheapen it as we can. I for my
part am truly of this opinion, that
we are much taken and caried away
with nothing more then with pleasure,
nor doe I mislike them who
are so, if they be solid* sincere and
honest pleasures we hung so after.
But beleeue me there can be nothing
more sweet and delicious, then the
^oyes and iubelies of the hart, drowned
in the loue of IESVS, and
wherein IESVS deliciats himself?
For why? It is a Paradise truly and
^ot that terrestrial one (though for
(...) amenity of the soyle and ayr,

and the exceeding plenty of flowers,
trees, and fruits, it were so glorious
and the very name of Paradise it-self
imports no lesse then a place of pleasures
and delights] but is indeed a
heauenly Paradise into the allyes
whereof and first walks, S. Paul being
hardly admitted, was so lulled with
al delights, that forgetting himself
and al things else besides he was able
to tel no more then this, I know a
man; saith he, whether in body I know
not, or without the body I know not God
knowes, to be rauished into the third
heauen, and to haue heard so mysterious
words, as man might not vtter.
2. Cor. 12. But what were they whence
so great a feeling of pleasure,
and delight results? Touch we
the thing it-self, with the needly
of faith only. In that celestial Paradise
of the blessed hart, IESVS
laying his Pilgrime habit a side, and

the vayle of faith wherewith he was
shrowded, shal exhibit his humanity
to be seen and enioyed face to
face: I haue said too litle, yea his
diuine essence also. This perhaps
were enough to beatitude yet wil
he cause the three diuine Persons,
Father, Sonne, and Holy-Ghost.
to be so present, as they may not
only be seen, but euen seeme in a
manner to be touched also.
Besides, in this natiue and most
lucid mirrour of al things, many
other things, nigh infinit for nomber,
for beauty and variety surely
admirable, shal shine with al, with so
new alwayes and so fresh an ob^ect,
that as long as eternity shal last they
shal not breed any tediousnes in the
beholders, or euer diminish the
^hirst of seeing and beholding more,
^^ere therefore, as in a liuely pi^^ure
expressed in their colours, those

mysteries of faith and religion shal
be truly represented, which now
hardly are but shadowed, and with
al our endeauour neuer wholy atteined
The Incarnation of the Word
in the Virgin, the Oeconomy of
mans Redemption, the diuine prouidence
in administring things, the
admirable and most hidden reasons
of punishing the good and prospering
the wicked: lastly, the lawes,
traces, and rapts of diuine loue, by
which he hath at last conducted the
hart which loues him; sweetly indeed
and yet strongly, now by the
pleasant, and then the horrid paths,
now of ioy then of sadnes, into the
seats of al beatitudes From the cleere
knowledge of al which verities, especially
the obiect of the diuine Nature,
and Persons, and conceiuing
the images in the mind, of so excellent
and admirable things, who sees

not very soueraigne and nigh incredible
ioyes to arise?
Queene Saba, scarce entring into
the roome where Salomon, was fel
into so great admiration, and was so
rapt and transported with delight, at
the order pompe, magnificence, especially
at the presence of the King
himself, that recouering breath at
last, which she had nigh lost, she
cryed out aloud: Blessed are thy men,
and blessed thy seruants who stand alwayes
before thee, and hearken to thy wisdome.
3. Reg. 10. Yet these are but toyes, chips,
trifles, compared with the presence
and sight of God.
They report of S. Francis, that
being once sadder then ordinary, he
was so taken and rauished with the
short modulation an Angel made
with the lightest touch of his thumb
on a Harpe, as he seemed to him^^lf
to be no more on the earth, but

to be conuersant in heauen, amid
the blessed Spirits there.S. Bona^ in vita S. Fran. Good
God! If these (which in heauenly
delights is likely one of the least
amongst them) so short and slight
touches of the Angelical hand, as
they could hardly be heard, were
yet able to rauish the holyman, what
would the harmony worke of so
many Angelical and humane voyces,
what exultatio^s would be there what
dances and iubelyes? Besides, if the
meanest things in heauen, as songs
and dances, so delight and tickle
harts, what wil the rest doe, both
for number and dignity farre greater?
What is more poore and slender
with vs the^ a bare and simple thought
of God? Yet Dauid in his greatest
troubles and afflictio^s when he felt
himself most opprest, with the tip
of the lips only of his soule, as it
were, would lick in this celestial (...)

diuine hony, and therewith take extreame
pleasure. I was mindful of God,
saith he, and took delight.Psal. 56.
Againe hauing but a thought only
the fruition of God, of meere ioy
he could hardly containe himself;
but sing in triumph. I haue reioyced
in the things which haue been told me we
shal goe into the house of the Lord.Psal. 111.
Which triumphal verse of the Royal
Psalmist, when our Angelical
Blessed Aloysius, being neere his
death through weakenes, could not
wholy bring forth, Reioycing saith
he, we goe reioycing, and with that so
broken and abrupt verse in his
mouth, euen dying wouderfully
exulted. Another time when the
Kingly Prophet, not only considered
that he was to goe to the house of
the Lord, but sending his soule as it
were before him into those galleryes
themselues and entryes of heauen,

and priuily laying his eares to the
doores in a manner of the Nuptial
Chamber, and obscurely hearing
a kind of whispering (I know not)
of some of the ioyes there within,
it not only wiped away from him
al sadnes, caused in him through
the formes exprobration obiected to
him of Where is his God? but dilating
his breast, made him to powre forth
his soule into most sweet and extatical
pleasures: And wherefore? Because
(saith he) I shal enter into the
place of the admirable Tabernacle euen
to the house of God, in the voyce of exultation,
and confession, the sound of the Master
of the feast.Psal. 41.
Lastly, another time, being yet
mortal when creeping by stealth as
it were he had secretly insinuated
himself into the bowre or conclaue
of the immortals, comparing
them with himself and our humane

affaires, he brake forth into these
termes of ioy, and congratulation:
How louely are thy Tabernacles oh Lord
of vertues! my soule couets and longs after
the galleries of the Lord My hart and
my flesh, haue reioyced in the liuing God.
Blessed are they, Lord, who dwel in thy
house, they shal praise thee foreuer and
euer. Because in thy galleries one day is
better then a thousand,Psal. 83. to wit, so
great is the pleasure of the eternal light,
Which (S. Augustin, expresly saith in
these wordsAug. lib. 3. de lib. arb. c. vlt. that though it were not
lawful to enjoy it longer then a day, yet
for that only, innumerable yeares of this
life, ful of delights and the aboundance
of temporal goods, vvere worthily and
with reason to be contemned. For it vvas
not falsely or slightly said, that better
is one day in thy Galleries, then a thousand.
So as it is less to be admired,
that Dauid should presently adde this
also: I haue chosen rather to be an abiect

in the house of my God, then to dvvel in
the Tabernacles of sinners.1. Par. 9. I had
rather, saith he, be in the lowest office
of a doore-keeper in the porch
of the Temple, and there watch at
the entry as a slaue before him, with
the hope of enioying this celestial
beatitude, then with the hazard of
loosing it; in the most ample and
sumpteous Palaces and houses, to be
obserued and courted, by a number
of clyents, and frends. Hence, that
affection of the mind aspiringe vnto
Heauen with a swift course, As the
Hart, couets the fountaines of vvaters,
so my soule desires thee, O God.Psal. 14.
That kind of beast truly is fleet and
swift, but then flyes he with most
speed, when either being chased by
hounds, or bitten with serpents, he
feeles an extraordinary thirst, for
then to quench that heat he runnes
headlong to the fountaines, and flyes

like the winds. Dauid thirsted likwise,
and no less groaned and sighed
after heauen. When shal I come and
appeare before the face of God? And for
the great desire he had and loue to
the heauenly countrey and the
felicity of the Blessed, which euen
absent he had tasted now and then,
had so great a horrour tediousnes
and auersion from humane things, as
teares to him were of familiar as
bread to others, nor vsed he food
more frequently then teares, yea
teares themselues were food vnto
him; so as oppressed with dolours
neither would he take his food, or
so much as thinke thereof; while to
him thus vehemently thirsting after
the presence of God, this gibing
taunt was obbrayded to his face,
Where is thy God?
From al which this same may be
^athered, that if in these Galleries,

though absent Dauid and diuers
other Saintly men haue taken such
pleasure, with what ioyes and delights
may we not imagine those
to swmme in, who are admitted into
the secret closet and cabinet of the
Spouse? If but a slight ray onli of the
blessed vision, so dazle the eyes of
the mind; if but a drop of the water
of Paradise and fountaine of the
chiefest good but lightly sprinckled;
if but a crumme falling from the table
of our Lord, so recreates and refresheth
mortals, what wil the whole
sunne himself doe? what wil the
very Ocean of al good things? what
wil the table of our Lord himself
conferre to the immortals? Shal not
the hart euen swimme trow you, in
these delights, yea be wholy immersed,
and drowned in them.



XX. MEDITATION.

The preparatory Prayer.
Actiones nostras quesumus, etc.

THE PRELVDE.
VVHen he shal appeare, we shal
be like to him: because we shal
see him, as he is: And whosoeuer hath this
hope in him, sanctifies himself as he is
holy.
1. Point. Consider how great a
good, how excellent, how delectable
it is, most cleere to behold one
God in essence, three in Persons,
Father, Sonne, and Holy-Ghost,
and that eternally in the mirrour of

the hart: Surely, the eye hath not seen,
nor eare heard, nor hath it ascended into
the hart of man what God hath prepared
for such as loue him:Rom. 8. Tast with the
inward sense these delights of the
heauenly Paradise, and loath the
leeke, and garlike of AEgipt the
miry bogs, the empty husks and filthines
of the world. Oh if thou couldst
but take a tast or assay before hand
with the glorious S. Augustin of the
ioyes of the Blessed, thou wouldst
say with him: How sweet to me sudenly
it vvas to vvant those svveets of idly
toyes, and vvhat before vvas a griefe to
loose vvas novv a ioy to forgoe vvholy thou
eiectedst them from me, the true and chiefest
svveetnes, and entredst thy self in;
insteed of them, svveeter farr then al
pleasure.Lib. 9. Conf. cap. 1.
2. Point. Ponder how, much this same
cogitation may and ought
auayle to endure and goe through

with any hart and difficult entreprise
for God and our saluation.
What changes sudenly and alterations
of minds, those fruites wrought
whith come from the land of Promise,
Num. 13. which made them surmo^ut
the difficulties, they feared so much
before? What doe not the wrastlers
generously performe and suffer in
sight of the goal and crownes proposed?
Surely the sufferings of this time
are not condigne to the future glory, vvhich
shalbe reuealed in vs.Rom. 8. With which
only napkin, (as S. Gregory obserues
in Iob cap. 7. that glorious and illustrious
Champion of the Christian lists
S. Paul. wiped away al the sweat of
the infinit and most greeuous labours
and troubles he sustained; and
so likewise the rest of Martyrs. But
this especially when S. Adrian being
a Soldiours, in the flower of his
^ge, beheld a great number of Christians

to runne very ioyful and glad
into torments, scaffolds, gibbets,
Crosses, fires, as it were to a wedding,
asked what hope it was that
drew and led them to it: and when it
was answered they hoped for those
goods which the eye hath not seen,
nor eare heard, nor hath ascended into the
hart of man, he was so mooued and
changed therewith, that presently
he gaue vp his name to be put into
the list, and vnder Maximian most
stoutly and valiantly suffred Martyrdome.
So much the hope of beatitude
could worke.
3. Point. See how immense and
powerful is the diuine loue of
IESVS, which through grace at last
leads a man vnto the vision it-self,
of the diuine effence, wherewith
euen God himself is blessed. Then
thinke what thou oughtst to yeald
to recompence this loue againe: no

lesse no doubt then reciprocal loue.
For when God loues, he would no
more then to be loued againe;
knowing the^ who loue him only, to
be truly blessed. So S. Bernard in his
83. Sermon on the Canticles. But to
the end thou maist loue God thou
art wholy to empty thy hart from
the loue of al other things. For euen
as a vessel (which is S. Anselmes discourse)
the more water is in it or any
other liquour, conteynes lesse oyle; so the
more the hart is taken vp with other loues
the more it excludeth this. There is yet another,
that as stench is contrary to a good
^dour, and darknes to light, so is al other
loue contrarie, to this: As therefore contraries
doe neuer agree wel together; so
this loue agrees not with any other loue in
the hart.




THE COLLOQVY.
SHal be made to IESVS, the most
deare louer of soules of whom
shalt thou earnestly beg, to impart
vnto thee his diuine loue which this
or the like forme: My God, giue me
tby self; behold I loue thee, and if this
be too litle may I loue thee more. I cannot
measure how much loue I want, of that
which were c^ough. This know I only, it
goes il with me, without thee: and al
aboundance which is not my God, is meere
pouerty. Let the sweet power then of thy
loue deuour me, grant I may liue and dye
with the loue of thy loue, since first thou
hast so loued, as thou hast not only afforded
me and done many great things for me;
but hast likwise wouch safest to dye for
me.Exs. Aug. and S. Francisco.
Lastly from the inward bowels
make an act of the loue of God

aboue al things, and so conclude in
thee wonted manner with a Pater and
Aue.



AN INCENTIVE
Of the Act of the loue of God
aboue al things.
GOod God! thou commaund me
to loue thee, and threatnest if I
doe it not: Is there any need of these
chaynes for me to be tyed to loue
theer Am I so voyd of sense, as to be
ignorant of thy benefits, graces,
perfections? Or rather doe I want a
hart, to loue an infinit good? Now
if loue be to be recompenced with
loue, what loue can parallel the

diuine loue? Thou hast loued me eternally,
euen when I was not or possibly
could loue thee: Thou hast created
the world, and co^seruest it hitherto
for my sake: Thou hast giuen order
to the Angels to guard me: Thou
wouldst be my reward beyond measure.
Thou callest me a sinner to
grace and pennance. But yet is this
farre more louely, most sweet Sauiour,
that being God, thou wouldst
become man, to suffer so hard and
cruel things and lastly dye on the
Crosse for me who had (cruel as I
am] so engaged thee death. But this
of al others is most sweet, that being
neere to death thou leftst me thy
body and bloud in the Sacrament,
an admirable pledge of thy loue
towards me. Oh Loue! o extasis of
loue! How thou deseru'st, my God,
to be highly loued of al men, aboue
al things. May I therefore so loue

thee (my IESVS,) Sauiour of louers
and loue of Sauiours, and so let
the face of thy loue euen swallow
me; that I may liue and dye with
the loue of thy loue, who through
the loue of my loue, hast likwise
vouchsafed to dye for me. Oh infinit
goodnes of God?


A Formulary of the loue of God
aboue al things.
O Great God, I loue thee aboue
al things; I loue thee with al
my hart, with al my soule, with al
my powers, and meerly of this same
loue I am sorry aboue al things for
offending thee the infinit good: most
firmely re oluing hence forth,
through thy grace, to keep al thy
commandements. And why doe I
loue thee aboue al things? surely for
this; for thy immense perfection, incomprehensible

power, high^^
wisdome, infinit sanctity and godnes,
that is, for thy self, O Father,
O Sonne, O Holy-Ghost three persons,
one God, who art aboue al
things. Amen. IESVS.
Ad maiorem Dei gloriam.
FINIS.
