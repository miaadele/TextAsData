same prerogative Cicero report that Fabius a famous roman think it a especial commendation to be surname pictor and say the same Cicero when I talk of painter I mean not the ridiculous fraternity of silly wall-washer neither do I ever once think of our lofty rhymer when I make mention of poet yet a wall may be colour by a elegant painter but the conceit and elegancy be more than the colour and

cover the most sacred mystery of ancient philosophy nay Pythagoras himself by his symbolical kind of teach as also Plato by his conceit parable and allegorical discourse in his book call Phoedrus Timoeus and may make any man believe that as the learned indian aethiopian and egyptian keep their doctrine religious secret for fear of profanation so the grecian by their example have wrap up in

conceive of ensue particularity jupiter juno Neptune Ceres with the rest be therefore call god and goddess for that in the superior and fiery region of the air note by jupiter in the inferior

Hypocrates and by the ancient poet more particular express by the sundry title of several deity proportionable thereunto and if the copulation or conjunction of these deify element observe the natural order of generation it be call of the poet a marriage of such a god and goddess if it swerve and degenerate from the wont course of nature they term it adultery and libidinous love and the party lover not man and wife as in the former kind of copulation so that no man have cause to think it a ridiculous repugnancy and impossibility when as poet in their song make mention of the love marriage procreation affinity offspring pedigree and descent of their superior and inferior god now for the transformation of Thirsis his chaos true it be that Ovid much after this manner discourse of the creation of the world of the reduce of the confuse chaos into distinct form of Prometheus his frame of man of the very earth itself which thing no doubt as also the distinction of time into four several age of gold silver brass and iron be take although in part mistake out of the sacred monument of Moses Hebraeus ^^t of some ancient poet who he call pronapides report another history of the same matter albeit not after the same manner Demogorgon s^ith he the great and terrible God of heaven and earth accompany only with eternity and chaos perceive on a time a outrageous uproar and tumult stir up in the belly and bowel of the forename chaos therefore to ease she he stretch forth his o^ne hand and open her womb whence present come forth a filthy and deform offspring call strife which no soon appear but immediate it breed brabble make a foul stir stir up contention and strive to mount up towards heaven but that by Demogorgon he be overrule and throw down to the low part and elemental region chaos as yet have not end her chile-bearing labour and travail but be trouble with heavy burden fainty sweat languish groan and fiery torment agony so that Demogorgon can not for pity withdraw his help hand till by his assistance she have bring forth pan with his three fatal sicter and also Erebus aether and die Pan find such favour that Demogorgon commit unto he the whole charge of his family command his three sister continual to wait and attend upon he as his handmaid and thus be chaos at last deliver and ease of her childbirth by Demogorgon or peradventure Demiurgon be here understand that one and only creator of all to who eternity be inseparable conjoin sith himself be be and will be eternal and everlasting chaos in his eternal society obtain the three place because she be that common confuse and undistinct matter which the ancient philosopher make coeternal with the creator call the one the father the other the mother of all thing form yet so as they always esteem Demogorgon the chief and efficient and chaos only the subsequent and secondary cause in this procreation the reason why they join chaos with the creator as a companion from all eternity be this they think it proceed from he by a certain eternal generation so proceed as eternal because always proceed yet so eternal as proceed because not of herself proceed but from the procreator and as they make chaos proc^ede from Demogorgon eternal without limitation of time so they affirm that he afterwards frame all thing of this unformed chaos not eternal but in time the tumult and uproar stir up in the bowel of chaos be her natural inclination and desire of bring forth thing variable and disagree the hand of Demogorgon which open she bely be that celestial power reduce the universal and confuse possibility of chaos to distinct form and actual particularity and give we also to understand that this first production of thing be not usual and accustom as natural generation be which afterward succeed this supernatural creation but strange and wonderful and do therefore require the use of Demogorgon hand that be the most mighty and effectual instrument of all other strife come first forth for from that ^irst and general matter of all that be make the division and distinction of thing which before be confuse and undistinct proceed and this division be call strife sith it converse among four strive and contrary element the one always malign and repugn the other his face be ugly and deform for discord and division cause defect want and imperfection as union and concord be the author of blessedness beauty and perfection strife strive to get up to heaven be throw down to the earth for in the celestial body there be no discord no repugnancy and therefore consequent no destruction or mortalyty effect thereof but only in these earthly and inferior matter continual subject to infinite decay and dissolution cause by opposition and contrariety the burden sweat groan and agony of chaos

general and universal power of nature rule and govern whatsoever proceed from chaos and quyet those disagree quality of the repugnant element whereupon it be here say that after strife come pan sith

against rufinus the two last child of Demogorgon be aether and Die the superirior region of the air and the brightness of the day who of brother and sister become man and wife and beget Caelius or Caelus the heaven which name be first attribute to Vranius father of Saturnus king of Crete this Vranius for his excellency be deem rather celestial as his name import than any earthly creature represent that ethereal purity by his divine wisdom and the celestial light and brightness by his virtuous conversation this be the historical sense now for the allegorical conceit it be most manifest for Caelus the heaven include and conclude every thing be therefore call the son of aether and Die for that his nature be ethereal by reason of his most subtle and spirit all perspicuity and also bright and lightsome by the plentiful and abundant light of those so many radiant star wherewith it be sweet garnish and as Vranius himself for his virtue be call Caelus heaven so Vesta his wife because she be a fruitful and happy mother be call Terra the earth of these two Saturnus be bear whole addict to husbandry and till of the earth and of nature slow and heavy like the earth allegorical thus Saturnus be son to Caelus because he be the first Planete and near to the high heaven he be also son to the earth as in most of his natural propriety resemble the earth first his colour be pale and leaden like the earth second as the earth of all other element be most gross and bevy so Saturn among other planet be most slow in finish his revolution as require full thirty year for the accomplish of the same whereas jupiter end he in twelve year Mars in two Venus and Mercury in one and Luna the moon in one month only three Saturn by his influence work such a constitution and temperature in man body as be altogether agreeable with the quality of the earth to wet cold and dry make they in who he be predominant sad melancholical grave heavy pale give to husbandry building and such like exercise whereupon he be figure as a old man sad evil-favoured muse bad clothe with a scythe in his hand a fit instrument for his earthly practice he afford a reach wit profound cogitation perfect knowledge sage and grave advice constancy of mind and perseverance by reason that the earthly nature of his mother be qualify and temper with that of his celestial father last as of his father he cause perfection and excellency of mind so by his mother he be the author of deformity and destruction of the body his wife be call Ops his own sister bear of the same father and mother allegorical opis signify help or assistance note the aid and furtherance of the earth herself towards the till of fill build of house and sound of city so be she worthy both sister to Saturn as bear of Caelus who influence be the best maintainer both of husbandry and earthly habitation and also wife to Saturn for that as he be the agent so herself be the patient in husbandry and fortification Saturn bereave his father Caelus of those instrument which be fit for generation Cronos that be Saturn be time time be the measurer of the world motion therefore as one world so one time one Saturn and Caelus can get no more like he sith all be now spen^ and consume upon he Saturn fear the prediction of oracle that his own son shall expel he out of his kingdom consult with his brother Titan resolve to devour all the son that his wife opis shall bear unto he and for that intent command she to show he every child immediate af^er the birth thereof she first bring forth jupiter and juno juno be a girl and therefore not to be devour be present to her father but jupiter be preserve from his rage and fury by the noise of cymbal and Taburs which so possess Saturn his ear that he hear not the young infant jupiter cry Saturn angry and earnest demand where he be his wife give he a stone wrap in a cloth instead of the boy which stone for haste and rage he swallow and afterward vomit it up again even as he do all such of his other son who he have devour the like policy she use in preserve of Neptune make his father believe that it be no child but a young colt whereof she be then deliver which Saturn think to be true glut the colt according next to these be Pluto and his sister Glauca bear but Glauca be only show to Saturn Pluto escape alive all the rest of his son he first devour and present vomit as before be mention allegorical Titan the sun and Saturn time conspire together and resolve that all thing in time bear shall also die in time for as the devour continuance of outwear time consume all thing so the life-giving influence of the quicken son be the chief cause of procreation whereupon it be usual say that the sun and man beget man his daughter he devour not for time consume this thing and that thing but not the root and ground of thing figure by the female sex juno the air with jupiter the fire and Neptune and Pluto the water and earth be not devour for the four element continue still but the rest be still subject to continual corruption corruption I mean in part which be always a generation of some other particularity not a total or general destruction which be the cause that time can digest and utter consume but be enforce to vomit and restore even those very body which he first devour according to that old ground which give we to learn that as nothing can be make of nothing so nothing can be make to be nothing Homer call jupiter (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) for that be suck goat milk the reason be this a goat be ever climb and get upward as jupiter be note the fiery and high part of the air this ethereal and superior part of the air be think of the pythagorean by reason of the wonderful celerity and quick dispatch of his motion and revolution to cause a most sweet and melodious harmony whereupon jupiter be report to be preserve by the tinkeling of cymbal and sound of tabur jupiter be place immediate after Saturn in heaven as jupiter king of Crete succeed his father Saturn in his kingdom this cr^etish king jupiter for his bountiful and liberal nature be call by the name of that most good and beneficial planet jupiter even as his father for the cause rehearse be name Saturnus he that have in his nativity Saturn predominant over jupiter be like to be endue with no excellent quality especial those that usual proceed from Jupiter influence as justice liberality magnificence piety favour beauty riches promotion love and such like all which by the malign nature of this damnify planet Saturn be altogether corrupt and deprave as the creetish jupiter when he be but a tender infant be fain to be secret convey away from his stern and cruel father Saturn who seek his destruction Saturn be imprison and chain by the titane be release by his dutiful and merciful son jupiter who come with a mighty army to the succour of his father allegorical when the good and beneficial jupiter in any man nativity overrule prejudicial Saturn behold the other planet with a amiable and fortunate aspect which confound the dead look and frown face of Saturn then be that man free from th^se saturnian chain of calamity and misery which otherwise he be subject unto these titanes be the son of heaven and earth signify the four element which include in themselves a certain terrene and earthly nature and be therefore continual depress and beat down by the power of the superior body for vapour by the heat of the sun the sun be call Titan be draw up which when they approach near the celestial region be repel and drive down again or else resolve into pure and subtle air and this mount up and throw down be perpetual jupiter when he have thus enlarge his father usurp his crown and royal dignity banish Saturn into hell or the infernal region historical jupiter have free his father from thaldome take upon himself the dignity and regiment of Crete enforce Saturnus to fly into Italy where he be honour live and die as a god for such be the custom of that age to attribute divine honour and title unto they as god of who they receive any goodness as they do indeed of this Saturnus who teach they how to till and manure the ground to coin money of mettale which before be of leather to leave bush and cave and live more civil and orderly and to observe certain law and constitution by he invent as appear by virgil. s. Aeneid who therefore call that time the golden age now in truth Italy be then far inferior to Greece in wealth and dignity and may therefore be call the infernal region or base and low country in respect of saturn flourish kingdom as also for that Italy be low than Greece as incline more to the west and it be a usual thing for man to call the east the superior or high region and the west he lower downcast and inferior or last as Varro will have it qd because Italy do as it be lurk and lie hide between the abrupt and high top of the Alpes and the mountain apenninus that this be true which I report of his be in Italy beside the testimony of Virgil in the place above allege where he say that Italy be name Latium a because Saturn do lurk and lie there to hide himself from his son jupiter Ovid also will bear i witness who in the first of his conclude this matter say that for a eternal memorial of his arrival and good institution the italian posterity in their money of mettale figure the ship wherein he come unto they allegorical as before when in any man action or nativity jupiter be predominant then do he control Saturn deprive he of his power and dominion and drive he out as his inferior Sabinus think that Saturn be therefore say to be drive into the infernal dungeon for that he be of all other planet the most remote and further from the earth make that infinite and unmeasurable height of heaven to be this Tartarus this infernal or strange and far remove region but the most conceit allegory for this purpose be that follow for although that in Satur time and reign that be by the influence and virtue of this planet Saturn the seed be preserve in the bowel of the earth and congcale or thicken in the body of sensible creature at the first generation and conception yet when these thing be bring forth and receive increase and augmentation then do jupiter show himself to be king and deal all in all drive out old Saturn into corner and blind and obscure place where the first seed of thing lie hide which only be subject to Saturnus jurisdiction time be swift and everpass without stay which may be the cause why Saturn be change to a swift courser when his wife take he dally with philyra of who he beget Chiron the centaur as hereafter will appear thus have we the good old Saturn in his rag with his four child before he his consume since in his right hand and a stone cover with cloth put to his mouth with the left hand out of Eusebius he may be thus also figure himself cover with a long robe two eye before as many behind of which four two do ever watch while other two sleep four wing be fasten to his shoulder two spread forth as though he be ready to fly two pluck in as though he mean to stand still he have also two wing at his head the four eye and wing note that time though it seem to sleep yet always watch and yet so watch as it seem still to sleep and as it stand it fly away and yet in fly after a manner stand still the two wing at his head be say to represent the intellectual faculty and reasonable power of man mind the old philosopher be of opinion that the soul receive from Saturn sphere the gift of reason and intelligence * * Saturn two picture Saturn his wife have diverse name rhea (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) either because every thing flow from the earth as from a fountain or that the flow reign be make of vapour and exhalation from the earth Vesta she be also call because she be that be cover with corn and grass as with a vesture or because she stand by she own force according to that of Ovid in his fasti.

where this Io be give in marriage to Osiris the egyptian king surname jupiter Ammon as Diodorus siculus make mention and Io herself be afterward among they honour for a goddess by the name of Isis. and because the egyptian in respect of husbandry do with divine service and ceremony honour a cow thereupon the fable take his ground that Io be steal by jupiter be transform to a Cow the impression

Niobe for her excessive pride and contempt of God be worthy plague yea so extreme plague in those very thing wherein she chief vaunt that for very anguish of heart and untolerable woe she be say to be turn to a dull and senseless marble stone the like mischief befall Arachne who be endue with excellent quality think scorn of the goddess which be her good mistress and may have be her patroness and be therefore transform to a spider Elpinus have conclude this discourse it be command by the lady regent that because juno be by nature and marriage conjoin with jupiter they shall also joint be remember before any other of Satur brood be meddle withal Fulvia therefore be appoint for this narration for that she can not ready call to mind any memorable tale of juno herself sing as follow of the nymph echo who be always take to be Juno daughter TIresias Juno and Jove judge blind yet aseer foretell Narcissus this destiny this pretty young boy shall be a man many year if he never look on

so lovely a look so sweet and cheerful a countenance that nymph and lady Narcissus daily desire yet so loveles a look so proud and scornful a countenance that nymph and lady Narcissus daily refuse echo once a day the resound echo that answer every question ask and yet no question ask see this gallant youth as he hunt a dear by the forest echo the tattle nymph be a true body then not a only

the delude tongue of prattle elf yet prattle elf thus abridge of too much tattle and babble in the beginning use her old custom by redouble word in a end therefore when she see we Narcissus go to the forest step for step thither by a secret path she repair burn still for love and as she near aproach unto the love boy so she more mighty burn howmany thousand time poor soul she desire a desire and entreat speech to the wander boy to be utter but fatal nature will noeway grant a beginning and yet what nature permit she greedy listen for some sound which may make she to be quick resound at last

make a end the best be I mean not to be so full of parable as that Elpinus shall have need to make any explication I have hear my mother many time in good sobriety make a long discourse of certain scholar of Cambridge who will needs find out some way to mount up to heaven and understand those mystery which be above the moon for this purpose they meet together at daw cros^e where after long debate of the matter it be resolve by the full consent of the learned assembly that they shall seek and search pass and repass from east to west some by land some by sea till they have find the way to heaven o it be a sweet sight to behold so many sagehead and gentle spirit thus unite and assemble together all be ready they all make haste some embark themselves some travel by land other stay in village adjoin expect some heavenly apparition or revelation from above they that be in the ship begin to consult of their attempt when lo on the sudden such grace the heaven afford to they that be heavenly affect there come a stranger yet a academic unto they who perceive that their resolution be not to intermit their labour till they have find the way how to go to heaven alive tell they that peradventure himself can give they best direction for that purpose and that if they will give he the hear he will discourse at large both what himself be and how diverse of his companion have attempt the like voyage and what have befall they in the same they all thank he for his unexpected courtesy will he to enter into the ship and with this discourse help they to forget the danger and yrksomenes of their travail which do he thus begin I be bear and breed five mile beyond s. Michael mount four summer before the green winter Saturn be predominant at my nativity my father a man of providence perceive my terrestrial disposition will needs have i admit a scholar in the university call the garden whereof we all be name gardiner our convocation house be a harbour sytuate direct under the arctike pole where every new moon myself and my fellow gardiner assemble together and sing such composition as we have several frame of the virtue of herb the pleasant liquor of the vine the sweetness of fruit the profit of husbandry and dress of garden and orchard in such sort that our university become famous by reason of diverse learned monument daily there devise and thence proceed to the public profit of the common wealth as the vulgar Dioscorides the garden of lady the moralization of the with many such wondrous work and as ourselves be delight in dress and keep of garden so do we choose we distinct name and addition of several herb according so that one be call a violet a other a thistle this lettuce that succory the rest either Borage Hmlock pasnip cowslip rosemary or some like but so it fall out on a day as we be thus busy in our harbour we hear of a report scatter abroad that a general deluge and inundation of water shall happen that year as be foretell by some idle prognosticator this strange news trouble the whole country and among other we poor gardiner who have read this lewd almanac and consider the flourish discourse of these astrological doctor which threaten the vine garden and orchard with blast frost caterpillar and a thousand such fantastical danger lay our head together and deal as I be about to tell you first we offer sacrifice to Bacchus and Priapus and then conclude to send some of our university as ambassador to heaven who by this one journey may do a double service the one in see whether these tale-tell astrologer have any ground for their prediction the other in obtain grace and mercy of the god by grant plenty and abundance among other Succhory a pleasant and merry companion have this conceit in his head to get up to heaven it be good i think qd he to find out a great and mighty eagle so strong that some two of we may mount on his back and he bear we up to the sky marry we have need to look that these 2 be not too heavy or overfat and corpulent lest the eagle be overcharge therefore the fennel and the violet in my fancy be the fit for this purpose as be deft and nimble fellow and as light as may be nay say cowslip there be no reason at all to use the help of a eagle in this matter because you know that jupiter himself be once transform into a eagle and carry up to heaven a other kind of burden than Fennell or violet then out step hemlock with his fryse bonnet and say that he have sound a better and more compendious way to heaven than that it be not amiss qd he if we have a cart because the journey be long and the ambassador may by this mean travel with great ease and facility beside this they may therein convey to Olympus some of the best fruit of our garden to present the god withal when they come thither the grave advice of this forecast Academike be general well like of save that they can not conceive who shall draw the cart and therefore this invention the more pity come also to nothing all the Academike gardiner devise and muse much how it may be bring to pass some remember Lucian ship think it best to go by water other rather by land through some great forest as dante do at last they all agree that the sure way be to make ladder of the pole that bear up their hop and by the mean thereof to build and raise up a tower that shall overlook the whole world and so may they in short time pierce the cloud and by certain engine still draw up new stuff to increase the height of their fortification if occasion be the tower begin and half end ^or many hand make light work we make choice of three the most expert man in all our university in astrology mathematics and philosophy to weet hemlock pasnip and the thistle to be ambassador these three gather diverse fruit raisin and herb to present the lord and lady of heaven withal and to request diverse bone in the behalf of our university so we bring and accompany they with great joy even unto the ladder and see they mount up chearefu hemlock be one Damoetas of the deareles park factotum to the lady of the lake pasnip be a brave piece of a man about four and thirty year old fair straight and upright so nimble and light that he may well have walk on the edge of a sword or point of a spear the thistle be more ancient as have pass full forty year and be whole addict to contemplation after much mount when the learned thistle be almost at the first heaven he begin to observe and mark whether Strabo Ptolomaeus and other measurer of the world have make a good survey thereof he view the top of the mount Parnassus where Lactantius and Plutarch appoint the limit of the deluge and perceive that from thence it be a thousand thousand mile up to heaven he laugh at their folly and make a mock of Berosus who will needs find out the centre of the earth by the ark of Noah thus jest at their ignorance and have his head full of cosmographical proclamation he begin to discourse to his companion of the situation and distance of kingdom mountain sea river and wood of the elevation of the pole the rise of the star and the name of every province with their law statute custom and different kind of discipline he show new-found world never know to Africa Europe or Asia he make Aristotle a ass who never think that all the zone under the zodiac be habitable with these and the like speculation and sweet sight they pass the time and continue further on their journey and further let they continue a while say the ruler of the company that come from daw cross in the mean time whilst your gardiner be mount up to heaven let we learn of you what become of the fearful prediction of those astrological master content qd the stranger and thus it fall out when these famous astrologer with their number point measure sign and instrument have conclude for certain that this inundation shall ensue which will overflow and drown the whole world so that not one person shall escape alive publish this their conceit abroad by print of their almanac and prognostication show from day to day in the house of great man and palace of prince the sign the eclipse of the moon the conjunction of the planet and other such fantasy portend as they say this future inundation they make every man fear and many run up to hill that if they must needs die they may die last and see other drown before among the rest the prior of saint bartholomews remove from London to Harrow hill and there bestow a hundred mark in fortify and furnish himself against the flood and now the time be at hand when all shall come to nought when I know not by what revolution or influence the air on the sudden begin to be black cloud to lower and rain to pour down so fast that every man very believe the astrological prediction will prove true in the end sith they seem so likely in the beginning this make man woman and child tag and rag to climb up to tree to the top of house castle and steeple to save their life all the world be thus on a uproar there come a odd astronomer peradventure have less learning but sure more wit than the other who see what a pitiful howl and lamentation be make on every side begin with bitter word and vehemency of speech to inveigh against the former astrologer say they be seditious fellow worthy to be clap by the heel and that all be stark false which they have put down to the terror of the poor people who of all other death be most unwilling to be choke with water this new doctor be for his labour account a fool of wise and fool for still as he thus preach it rain still at last about two or three hour after as God will the air begin to clear up the rain cease the storm be past and all be well again then come forth the amaze people from tree rock and castle distract between hope and fear scarce resolve whether themselves be dead or alive as if they have come from the new-found world or out of Trophonius den and by degree come to their former sense and wit make great feast and bonfire for joy that they have escape a danger which never hang over their head the astronomer that give out this comfortable contradiction see that all fall out according to his speech although peradventure himself think as the rest do bear himself lofty be make a doctor and dub a knight for learning which be never in his head and the rest be scorn for fool which have publish the contrary prognostication short after this the first astrologer see themselves foul oversee and that this other doctor by some seraphical instinct have foretell the truth come unto he reverence he as a demi-god and desire he to impart unto they the ground of this his knowledge and conceit which do they will acknowledge he for their only master and captain in all their astrological speculation what ground qd he Mary the sure ground I assure you for be you such sot to imagine that in this my prediction I have regard to any astrological divination and not rather to a most sure and unfallible consequence of reason better than a thousand observation of sign and constellation if this your universal deluge have happen my grand master and doctor who will then have be leave alive to prove i a liar all the world be drown if it happen not as in truth it so fall out I be sure of the general applause of the people for this my plausible prognostication all the laugh hereat and now qd the chief of their company it be like that your fellow gardener be almost at heaven by this therefore continue your discourse as they I hope have continue their journey with a good will qd the stranger and thus it come to pass my fellow at last come to a fair and plain cloud which tutch the very top of their tabernacle think they have be at their journeys end and that it have be a easy matter to have dispatch the rest on foot but they miss their ma^ke and come short of their account which trouble they not a little and as they stand thus consult with themselves how they may safe pass further behold there come on a sudden a man and a woman ride on a little cloud as though it have be a courser who salute they courteous and bid they welcome demand what they seek for in so high a place where it be very difficult to mount up further and more dangerous to go down again we be academike qd pasnip and be of late trouble and perplex with the repugnant conceit of astrologer and menace and threaten with their unhappy prediction have travel hither of purpose to understand whether their divination be true or not and if as they say the god have determine to plague we and our garden with sterility and inundation then have we diverse petition to be prefer to the immortal god on the behalf of ourselves and our orchard which be once peruse and according consider by their divine majesty we have bring with we such simple fruit as our poor ability can afford to present their celestial deity withal it be a strange thing say the man on the cloud to see you here so high but what contradiction find you among your astrologer i think you presume very much in dare to reprehend great clerk and mount up to the sky yourselves be but gardiner and ignorant man though we be gardiner qd the thistle yet let not that be prejudicial unto we for myself be a doctor of astrology and can yield you a account of the opinion of the chaldee egyptian indian moor arabian jew grecian roman modern and ancient whatsoever all who conceit I find as variable as the moon and themselves altogether lunatic before I make answer hereunto qd the man that ride on the cloud I will tell you my name I be call understanding and this my sister be name fantasy or opinion our duty and function be to guide and conduct to heaven all such person as here arrive but not as you have arrive though indeed by reason of the small number of they that mount up hither we be not so pester with business but that we have leisure enough to confer with you well then my friend you must know that there be diverse way here all which will bring you to one and the same end true it be that there be one way through which very few pass because they see so many strange and most miraculous apparition that when they return again to their companion below on the earth they can meet with nothing there to the which they may full compare or resemble those heavenly miracle when they seek to make report thereof to their friend or other company desirous of their celestial news and in truth for any one that come hither with a commendable desire to reform the disorder of man life there be five thousand that ambitious be drive forward by a foolish curiosity when we bring hither Plato Aristotle Proclus Auerrois and other that have discourse of the heaven we conduct they by such a way that they see but eight sphere Albertus I sake and many other be guide through a other passage and find out nine sphere and thus have they ever from time to time repugn their fellow conceit without doubt qd hemlock I believe it be as you say for so among we below if a man ask how many mile it be from tugford to tasley seven say one eight say another nay so many man

and wander about the incomprehensible quantity of the heaven without my company and frame of their own invention five hundred foolery and monstrous imagination in the heaven here they paint a bull there a dog here a goat there a lion and such like as bear horse and fish whereupon well may the philosopher bi^n reprehend their curiosity who can not perceive a fish swim in a brook before their eye and yet will find out fish above the cloud and Thales be as worthy mock by his maid for that whilst he be toot on the star he fall into a ditch not know what be before his foot yet inquisitive in search out the secret of heaven without my assistance such fantastical and frantic fellow be for just cause banish the court by the good and learned Alphonsus king of Arragon for it be true say that
