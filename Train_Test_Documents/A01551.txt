1. TIMOTH. 6. 6.
Godlinesse is great Gaine, with Selfe-sufficiencie; or, with the Sufficiencie of it selfe.


THE FORMER PART. The Gaine of Godlinesse.
THe Stoick Philosophie, which Act. 17. 18. Luke the Euangelist maketh mention of, Lege Cicer. parad. and Lipsij ^^^nud^ct. was famous for Paradoxes, strange Opinions, improbable, and besides common conceit, Seneca passion, and Arrian. in dissert. and alij. admired much for them by some, Plu^. in Stoic. contradict. and quod Poet^ Stoicis probabiliora la^^antur. controlled and taxed for them by others. Howbeit not Stoicisme onely, but euery art and profession, euery course of life and learning hath some Paradoxes or other; the

world not a few, and* In hic creber est Chrysostomus: quod notavit Six^us Sen: biblioth: l. 4. Christianitie many more, as strange, yea stranger, than any that the Stoicks euer held, and yet (...) Agatho. (...). Aristot. rhetor. l. 2. c. 26. Verissimaque sunt non pauca, quae tamen sunt minime verisimilia. no lesse true than strange.
A worldly Paradox the Apostle had mentioned in the verse next before going, to wit, that some men should hold Gaine to be Godlinesse: vnto which he opposeth a contrary Christian Paradox in the words of my Text, to wit, that Godlinesse is the onely true Gaine.
For the former: It is a very absurd conceit indeed, and though too too rife in the world, yet such as few or none will be acknowne of, and either openly father, or seeme outwardly to fauor. But as God at the last day, when the wicked shall go about to excuse and defend themselues, he will not onely take hold of their words, Ex ore tuo indicab^ te, serue nequa^. Math. 25. 26. Luk 19 22. By thine owne mouth will I iudge thee, thou thriftles seruant; and aduantage of their actions, Math. 25. 42, 43. I was naked and yee clad me not, hungry and yee fed me not, etc. and theresore had neither Faith nor Loue; but he will conuince them by their owne Consciences too, Rom. 2. 15. Their secret thoughts shall either excuse or accuse them in that day: In like manner must we deale with those that will seeme to abhorre and detest this Opinion, and yet do those things that maintaine and vphold it.
Psal. 14. 1. and 53. 1.^he ^oole saith i^ (...) heart, There is no God; and that is sufficient to proue him an Athe^^ though he neuer openly maintaine any Position of Atheisme. And there be some that Tit. 1. 16. professe they know God, but denie him in their deeds: and Quiescat lingua, loqua^^^ vita. Aug. in 1. Ioan. hom. 3. (...). E^s^h. prepar E^a g. l. 1. c. 1. Efficacius est vita testimonium qua^ lingue* Cypria^. do dupl martyr* Et (...) v^^ ^peris quam ^^^. ^ern. in C^nt. that is enough to proue them irreligious, though they neuer vtter that their impietie in speech. So in this case, the Couetous

mans heart saith it, and his practise proclaimeth it, that Diuites facultatibus suis alligates mag^^ aurum consueuisse suspic^re quam coelu^. Minut. Octav. Quid f^cisti quod iussit Deus? quid no^ facis quod auaritia iubet? Aug. de diuers. 12. ^uam si sacrificem summo Jovi, Atque in manibus exta teneam vt porriciam, interea loci. Si lucr^ quid detur, potius r^m diuina^ desera^. Plaut. Pseud. 1. 3. his Gold is his God, and that his Gaine is his Godlinesse; and that is sufficient to proue him an Idolater, though he neuer outwardly bow his knee to an Idoll. In regard whereof, the Apostle expresly pronounceth Coloss. 3. 5. Couetousnes to be Idolatry, and the Ephes. 5. 5. Lege Chrys ad Eph. ho^. 18 Couetous man an Idolater.
To reason then in this point, as our Sauiour himselfe doth: Vbi thesaurus, ibi and cor. Math. 6 21. Nemo enim potest nisi cogitare de thesauro suo, and quoda^ cordis itinere diuitias suas sequi. Aug. de diuers. 44. Where a mans Treasure is, theire is his Heart; and where a mans heart is, there is his happinesse; and where his happinesse is, that is his God. Since the couetous man therefore Psal. 62. 12. setteth his heart on his riches; Psal 49 6. Job. 31. 24. putteth his trust in his treasure: and whereas Pro. 18. 10. (...). Basil. in Psal. 45. the faithfull make the name of God their strong towre, wherevnto they resort in time of trouble for safetie, Pro. 18. 11. the worldly rich man maketh his wealth his bulwark and fence, wherevpon he reposeth himselfe and wholy relyeth: It must of necessitie follow herevpon, that as the Apostle saith of the fleshly-minded man, that Phil. 3. 19. Rom. 16. 18. Clem. p^dag. l. 2. c. 1. (...). ventre^ colu^t, que^ pro Deo habent. Cypr. de dupl. Martyr. Quibus Deus venter est, and pulmo te^plu^, and aqualiculus altare, and sacerdos cocus, and Spiritus sanctus nidor, and codime^ta charismata, and ^uctus prophetia: agape in cacab^^ fervet, fi^^^ in c^l^^i^ calet, spes in ferculis iacet. Tertull. de i^iun. Whose gut their God, whose lust their law. Sylvest. week. 2. day. 1. Vise Euseb praepar. l. 7. c. 2. his belly is his God; so of the worldly-minded man, that (...) Theog^. (...) Euripid. (...). Antiphan. (...) So phoel. Creusa. Quod autem quisque prae caeteris colit, id sibi Deum const^^isse probatur Bern de bonis deser. Ergo vt voracium Deus venter est; ita cupidorum pec^^^^ Deus iustiss^me dicitur. Hieron. in Ephes. his money, or

his penny is his God: And if his Money be his God; his Gaine must needs be his Godlinesse.
But the Apostle here telleth vs a quite contrary tale, and learneth vs here a flat opposite lesson; that, howsoeuer worldly men may thinke that Gaine is Godlinesse; yet in deed and truth it is not so; but Godlinesse rather is Gaine, and great Gaine.
So that the Apostle doth (...), propositionem invertere; he turneth the proposition cleane backward, and bringeth it about, as it were. Gaine is Godlinesse, saith the worldly man. Nay, Godlinesse is Gaine, and great Gaine, saith the Apostle, and the Spirit of God by him.
But this peraduenture will seeme a Paradox as strange as the former. As very few that will outwardly avow the former; so as few are there that are inwardly perswaded of the latter. It seemeth a Paradox with the most.
For, Godlinesse great Gaine? may some man say. The contrary rather seemeth vndoubted and vndeniable, to wit, that Isto t^ pauperes, cum nimis sancte pius. Plaut. Rude^t. 4. 7. Varro, regustatum digito terebrare sal^num contentus perages, si vi^ere cum love te^di^ P^rs. sat. 5. Godlinesse is a great enemie to Gaine. Balaam lost great wealth and honor, because he would not disobey the word of God: Num. 24 11. I had thought, saith Balak, to haue aduanced thee, and made thee a great man; but thy God hath kept thee from honour. Michah might haue bin a great man in Ahabs bookes, and very richly and royally reward^d by him, if he would haue spoken but two words onely, as some other did; if he would but haue said, (...) Ascende in pace. 1 King. 22. 12, 13. Goe vp in peace. But his Godlinesse hindred his Gaine; and not so onely, but was a meane to bring him into much trouble. So that it may seeme,

that Godlinesse is altogither gainelesse, and Vngodlinesse the more gainefull of the two.
For the Nehem. 13. 16. Merchants of Tyre and Zidon for lucre and gaine straine courtesie with Gods commandement, to vtter their fish and wares on the Sabbath. And no doubt of it, Facile^ esse cui^ ad diuitias viam, quo die bon^ mentis poenituerit. Demetrius apud Senecam natur. quest. l. 4. pr^fat. Gods children, if they would not be so strict and strait laced; if they would not stand vpon nice points and termes; if they would not sticke to lye and dissemble with Act. 5. 1, 2. Ananias and Sapphira; to belye and beguile, as Ziba, Mephibosheths man did his Master; to sweare and forsweare,y 1 Sam. 16. 1, 2. with 1 Macc. 1. 61, 62. prophane Antiochus; to steale and purloine with yong Iudg. 17. 2. Micah of Mount Ephraim; to oppresse and murther, when they haue ius in manibus, the law in their owne hands, with 1 King. 21. wicked Ahab, and cursed Iezabel; they might as well come to wealth, as many worldly men do, that scrape and gather much goods togither by these meanes. But they may well say, as the Psalmist saith, Psal. 67. 7. Eu^ qui sit iustus ac bonus, stultum esse. Carneades apud Ci^. de repub. l. 3. Vise Lactant. institut. l. 5. c. 12. 14. For thy sake, O Lord, are we counted fooles; because we stand so much vpon matter of conscience.
1 Cor. 9. 15. 23. Holy Paul saith he might haue done this and that, but he would not, because he would not make the Gospell euill spoken of. And the keeping of a mans word turneth oft-times to his losse. The Psal. 15. 4. godly man sweareth and faileth not, though it be to to his owne hindrance: that which a worldly man will not willingly do. So that it may seeme then that Godlinesse is rather a great enemie to Gaine, and Vngodlinesse a great deale the more gainfull.
But those that define Losse and Gaine on this wise, do not try them by the right touch-stone, do

not weigh them out in the Ballance of the Sanctuarie, at the Beame of Gods word: and therefore no maruaile, if they take the L^k. 16 11. Diuitie nec vere nec vestr^. Aug. de verb. Dom. 35. and de diuersis. and Bern. de bon. deser. false Riches for the true Treasure.
For Genes. 2. 19. man indeed had auctoritie giuen him to name the Creatures, and he hath named worldly Wealth, Gaine: But God that is aboue man, and that gaue man this auctoritie, he hath named Godlinesse, Gaine, and not Wealth. As the Apostle therefore saith, 2 Pet. 3. 9. God is not slacke, as men count slacknes: so Godlinesse is not Gaine as men count Gaine, but as God counteth Gaine. For 1 Sam. 16. 7. man seeth not as God seeth; Esai. 55. ^. nor thinketh as God thinketh. But as Luk. 16. 15. those things that are pretious in mans eyes, are abominable in Gods sight: so 1 Cor. 1. 28. Psal. 51. 17. those things that are contemptible in the eyes of man, are 1 Pet. 3. 4. of high account many times in the sight of God. And euery thing is, not as man valueth it, but as God esteemeth it; not as man reckneth it, who is Psal. 62 9. and 39. 5. vanitie it selfe, and therefore may easily be deceiued, yea Galat. 6. 3. Jam. 1. 26. oft-times deceiueth himselfe; but as God rateth it, Tit. 1. 2. Si v^lunt in^enire, quod (...) non potest, habent prorsus, ^entiri non potest. Aug. de ci^it. l. 22. ^. 25. Potenter hoc non potest. Idem de Trinit. l. 15. c. 14. Magna potentia mentiri non posse. Ibid. 15. who neither doth deceiue any, Galat. 6. 7. nor can by any be deceiued, being Iob. 14. 6. Veritie and truth it selfe.
Either then we must say as God saith, or we must say as the World saith. Either we must say, that Godlinesse is no Gaine, or else we must say, that Gaine is no Gaine, when Godlinesse and Gaine shall stand forth togither, either in way of comparison the one with the other, or in way of opposition the one vnto the other.
Now, when Godlinesse and Gaine shall in this manner contend, that Godlinesse ought to haue

the day of it, will euidently appeare, if it may be shewed vnto vs:
First, that Godlines is Gaine rather than Gaine: and
Secondly, wherein this Gaine of Godlinesse doth consist.
For the former, to wit, that Godlinesse is rather to be accounted Gaine, than Gaine, may be proued to vs by these three Arguments.
First, Godlinesse may doe a man good without gaine, but worldly gaine can do a man no good without godlinesse. As the Heathen Orator saith of bodily might, that (...). Isocr. ad Demonic. strength of bodie ioyned with discretion and wisdome, may do a man much good; but without it, it is but (...). Plut. de muliebri disciplina apud Stob. to^. 2. c. 90. as a sword in a child, or in a mad mans hand, rather a meanes to mischiefe a mans selfe than otherwise: as we see an example in Milo Crotoniates, the strongest man of his time, - viribus ille co^^^sus perij^, admirandisque lacertis. Iuvenal. sat. 10. Legatur Gellius l. 15. c. 16. and Val. Max. l. 9. c. 12. Qui concludit, Nimio robore memb^o^u^ ^igorem mentis hebescere, quasi abnu^nte natura vtriusque boni largitione^, ne supra mortalem sit foelicitate^, eundem and valentissimum esse and sapientiss^mum. who vnwarily assaying, on trust of his strength, to riue a peece of timber with his hands, which some others with wedge and beetle could not cleaue, was caught fast by the fists, and so deuoured by Wolues. So Riches ioyned with godlinesse and good Conscience, are the Omnia ista bon^ sunt, sed vnde^acias be^e, non quae te faciant bonu^. Aug. de temp. 238. good blessings of God, a meanes Deus b^nadat, vt b^nos faciat. Salvian. de prouid. of good to our selues, and of doing good vnto others: but being seuered from godlinesse and the true feare of God, are rather (...). Euripid. Ple^sthen. (...) Menand. ^opes iritamenta malorum. O^^d. Metam. l. 1. occasion of euill than otherwise, rather (...) Iscer ad Demon. (...) Eurip. Phaethon. Magna cognatio vt rei, sic nomi^^s, diuitijs and vitijs. Eucher. ad Valer. an instrument of vice, than any furtherance to virtue, a meane to make as our sinnes the greater here, so

our condemnation accordingly the more grieuous hereafter.
So that as the Heathen man saith, that Damnu^ non lucrum est cum mala fama lucru^. P. Syr. Gaine gotten by losse or hazard of a mans good name, is no gaine but losse; because a man looseth therein more then all his gettings can counteruaile: since that Prou. 22. 1. (...) Isocr. ad Dem^. (...). Mena^d. A good name is (as Salomon saith) aboue riches and treasure; of greater worth than any wealth. So Gaine gotten with the breach or hazard of a good Conscience, when it is Luk. 16. 9. mammona iniquitatis, the Mammon of iniquitie, or Iud. 11. merces iniquitatis, the wages of wickednesse, it is (...). titulus sine re. Chrysost. in Psal. 111. no Gaine, but losse indeede: It is, as the Greekes say of (...). Heraclit. apud Eustath. ad Iliad. ^. a Bow, Life in name, but Death indeede; so Gaine in name, but Losse in deede: ((...). Hesiod. (...) (...). Chilo. (...). Peri^^d. (...). Eurip. Cyclope. (...). Idem Ant^gon. (...). Me^and. Periculosum semper reputa^i lucru^. Ph^drus fab. 85. Heathen themselues so esteemed it; not Nemo habet i^^^s^^ lucru^ sint iuste da^n^. Aug. de temp. 215.

Christian men onely:) Since that a man doth in these cases but, as that Romane Emperor had wont to say, ^^s qui mi^^^^ c^^^da no^ minime sectare^tur discrimine, si^iles ai^bat esse (...) ^^r^^ pisca^tib^^, (...) nulla c^p^^r^ pensari posset. S^et^n. Augusto ^. 25. fish with a golden hooke, and that for a googeon: (...). De^^tr. Phal^r. apud. Athen. l. 6. he hazardeth more than his whole prey, though he catch it, and (...). Democrit. Turpe lucrum vi^^^^u est de^rime^^um. Ambr. in Psal. 118. Plus in ipsa ini^ri^ detrimenti est, quam in (...) rebus (...). Ci^^^ ^e ^^^ib. l. ^. Neque tantum est co^^^d^ quia ^dip^s^^ se p^^^^, quantum (...) ac^^rsat. Ambros. offic. l. 3. c. 4. ver^ itaque Antipha^^s, (...). he may misse of his purpose therein too, can make amends for it, if it miscarry, be

that he get and gaine neuer so much. And for a man to get and gaine neuer so much one way, if by the compassing of it he loose far more an other way, it is in truth no Gaine at all.
For this cause as the Apostle asketh the Question; Rom. 6. 21. Quid profuit? What profit had yee then of those things, whereof you are now ashamed? nay, Si secundu^ merita tibi daret, da^naret te. Aug. in Psal. 102. for which now you should be damned, if you had your desert; for the end of such things is death: And the damned Spirits demand of themselues; Wisdom. 5. 8. Quid prodest? What profit haue we now of all our profits and pleasures, that we enioyed in the world, when we are hurled headlong into hell? So our Sauiour himselfe asketh, Matth. 16. 26. Quid proderit? What will it profit a man to winne the whole world, Luk 9. 35. and destroy himselfe, Mark 8. 36, 37. or loose his owne Iste omnis huius questus seculi animarum dispendium est. Ambros. epist. 44. Caue itaque ne dum acquiras pecuniam, perdas animam. Aug. de temp. 215. soule? Non potest vlla compendij causa co^sistere, si constet animae dispendium intervenire. vbi salutis damnum, illic vtique iam nullum lucru^ est. quo enim lucru^ capiatur, nisi capiendi sedes inconcussa seruetur? Eucher. ad Valer. O si lucreris totum, quid proderit, orbem, Dum iacturam anima feceri^ ipsae tuae. Tale tibi foe^^ fert lamentabile fun^^: Hicque illex quastus questus and ^stus erit. Ne perdas perdenda, animam, stultissime, perdes: Nunc sanum insan^ synciput opto tibi. G. Goodwin. to get all the world beside himselfe; but by gaining it to loose himselfe: for Animus cuiusque ipse est quisque. Cic. de amicit. euery mans soule is euery mans selfe: to doe as Jona. 1. 12. Ionas, At contra Aristippus in nare piratica agen^ cum aurum in mare proiecisset, (...). Laert. Et Crates misso in mare, auro, Abite, inquit, pessum mala cupiditates, mergam vos, ne mergar a nobis. Hieron. in Iovin. l. 2. Pereat mundi lucrum ne fiat anima damnum. Aug. in Psal. 103. Perde ne pereas. Idem de verb. Dom. serm. 35. that suffred himselfe to be cast ouerbord into the sea, that the ship with her lading, when he is lost, may come safe to the shore.
On the other side, as another saith, Pecuniam in loco negligere, maximum interdum est lucrum. Terent. adelph. 2. 2. Non ego omnino lucrum omne esse vtile homini existimo: Est etiam vbi profecto damnum praestet facere, quam lucrum. Plaut. Capt. 2. 2. For a man handsomely to refuse money, and forgo gaine, it is no small gaine sometime. So for a man in some case to forgo his gaine, to refuse gold, to neglect his owne

good, though Quis nisi mentis in^ps oblatum respuat aurum? so to do may seeme ^olly, when Game and Godlinesse will not agree togither, when Aug. de te^p. 215. lucrum in arca facit damnum in conscientia, and Ambros. in Psal. 218. ser. 5. lucrum pecuniae dispendium ^it animae; when profit in a mans purse would procure a broach in his Conscience, and the gaine of gold proue the break-neck of his soule; (...) Georg. Pr^id. de vanitat. vita. such refusall of gaine is the greatest Gaine that can be. For saith an ancient Father well, Quan^u^libe^ magna amittere, vt m^iora acquiras, no^ est damnum sed negotiatio. Bern. de bon des. To let goe, though neuer so great a matter, for the compassing of a greater, is no loosing bargaine, but a gainefull negotiation. To which purpose the Apostle Paul hauing related, what a great man he might haue bin among his owne People, had he held on in Iudaisme as he began; he concludeth at length, that he deemed allPhilip. 3. 7, 8, 9. that, and all else, but as (...). losse, and as (...). drosse and donge; as some Grammarians expound the word there vsed, as (...). Dogs-meat, or as others rather, as Dogs-donge, in regard of the assurance of Gods sauour toward him in Christ, the hold he had of him, his conformitie with him, and his interestk (...) H^^ych. (...). ^^yolog. (...). in him.

For some would it may be, if they could; so peruersely and malitiously-minded, that they hate the godly, euen for this cause because they be godly, and Psal. 38. 20. because they follow that that is good.

He asketh yet a third question, as the vpshot of all: Omnia? etiam mors ipsa? What? all things? euen death it selfe, 1 Cor. 15. 26. the vtmost enemie of all? And he answereth himselfe as before, or rather further than before; Mors bonis b^n; plurimum confort. Aug. ad Bonif. l. 4. c. 4. Etiam mors vel maxime: Yea, death as much as any thing, nay most of all. For so saith the same Apostle againe; Philip. 1. 21. (...) Quod ^ prim^ exp^fur^^e Ad^ur. A^ray in Philip. ^^ct. 17. Christus mihi vita, and mors lucrum; as he readeth the words; Christ is my life, and Death is my gaine. That Pro^. 11. 7. which is the greatest losse that can be to the worldly man; is Philip. ^2. 3. the greatest matter of gaine that can be to the godly.
Thirdly, Wordly wealth abideth with vs but for a short time: whereas Godlinesse and

But though they haue al as aquilinas, great Eagles wings to flie from vs withall while we are here; yet haue they ne passerin as quidem, not so much as litle s^^r^wes wings to flie after vs, and follow (...) when we go hence. ^* Tim. 6. 7.

man that is risen sodninely to great riches and honour, saith the Psalmist. No? why, who would not admire one that liueth in such state and pomp as Nihil est insolentius noviti diuite. Sen. lib. 2. controv. 1. such are vsually wont to do? Vides viu^ntem: c^gita mori^^tem. quid hic habeat, a^tendis: quid secum tollat, ar^e^d^. Aug. and Ruffin. in Ps 48 Yea but, when he dieth, he shall carrie none of that his wealth away with him; nor shall his pompe and state descend with his corps. Eccl^s. 5. 14, 15. As he came naked, so shall he go naked againe, and leaue all that by his care and indusirie he had raked togither and heaped vp, behind him; and in all respects goe euen as he came.
It is with vs in this world, as it was in the Iewish fields and vineyards; Deut. 23. 24, 25. plucke and eat they might what they would, while they were there, but they might not pocket or put vp ought to carry away with them: Or Mund' iste gardinus est, nos p^^ri, mors ia^^t ^. and. Gvil. Paris. summa de vi^ijs, and Al^o^. Carpent. destruct. vit: p. 4. ^. ^. as with boyes, that hauing gotten by stealth into an Orchard, stuffe their sleeues and their pockets full with apples and peares, well hoping to get out with them, but when they come to the dore, they finde one there that searcheth them, and taketh all their fruit away from them, and so sendeth them away with no more than they brought in: Or Guil. Paris. and Alex. Carp. ibid. as poore men, that invited to a rich mans bord, haue the vse of his plate to drink^ in, and siluer spoones to eat with while they are there; but if any of them presume to put vp a peece of plate or a spoone, there is search made by the Porter, ere they are let out, for what is miss^ng among them, and so are they turned out againe as they came in: In like manner is it with vs in regard of these temporall blessings; we haue free libertie to vse them as we will while we are here; but when we are to goe hence, Mors mund^ ^^sor; qui oues elus in (...)

Chrysost. in Psat. 4^. there is one waiting on vs,

that will be sure to strip vs, and suffer nothing to passe with vs, vnlesse it be some sory sheete, or a seare rag to rot with vs, Non magis h^c ad defunctum pertinent hominem, quam secundae ad editum infantem. Sen. epist 92. Istud non sentienti supervacuum est, sentienti onus. No^ defunctoru^ causa, sed vivorum, inventa est sepultura, vt corpora visu and odore foed^ amorerentur. Idem de remed. fortuit. Exhibentur ista no^ sentienti: tanqua^ or^atus dormie^ti, qui in pannis esse s^ somniat. Aug. in Psal. 48. Sed and vnguentum accipis diues, postqua^ mortuus es, and foetidus es. Perdis alienam gratiam, nec acquiris tuam. Ambr. de Nabuth. c. 1. that which yet we shall haue no sense of, nor be any whit at all the better for, than if we were wholy without it.
But Godlinesse, and the gaine of it, will abide by vs for euer. Sicut charitas 1. Cor. 13. 8. sic pi^t^^ non excidit. Ier. 32. 40. Psal. 85. 8. H^ sunt vere diviti^, quas cum habuerimus, ^^^dere non (...)* Aug, de verb (...). 76. It is a grace that we cannot loose or fall from; (...) Pl^t. d^^thi^. virt. (...). Pl^t. de p^dag. (...).

God will neuer forsake thee; so Godlinesse will neuer leaue thee, if thou beest once soundly and sincerely religious. (...) ad (...), ad (...). Vise Cicer. T^s. (...) 5. It will goe vp with thee to the wheele, it will goe downe with thee to the rack: it will keepe with thee while thou liuest; Apoc. 14. 13. it will away with thee when thou diest. For Prov. 11. 7. Iob. ^7. 8. (...). when the worldly man dieth, his hope dieth with him; Prov. 14. 32. Iob. 13. 15, 16. (...)* but the godly hath hope euen in death. And (...)* the Feare of God, that is Godlinesse, and (...). the righteousnesse of it, in (...). 19. ^^* the reward of it, that is the gaine that commeth by it, endureth for euer, and extendeth it selfe to all eternitie, lasting not onely past this liues end, but past the whole worlds end, with which all worldly wealth and gaine; must needes haue an end.
This world is compared to a Fishing; the (...) 1^. ^7. end of it, to the drawing vp of the nets: while the nets are downe, there is nothing said to be caught; for

the nets may breake, and the Fish escape. But at the end of the world, when the nets are drawne vp, it will then euidently appeare what each man hath caught. And then those that haue fished here for riches and gaine, may say with Peter, Luk. 5. 7. Domine, tota hac nocte laboravimus, and nihil cepimus: Lord, all this night haue we laboured, and caught nothing at all. For Praesentia amantes praesentibus indormiunt, thesaur^s somniant, tantisper divites, quamdiu non vigilent: vbi transijt delectabilis s^mnus iste, nihil in manibus suis inv^niunt. Aug in Ps. 76. 5. the worldly rich, when they awake out of their present sleepe, wherein they dreame of gold and gaine, shall finde nothing in their hands. But those that haue here fished for Godlinesse, may say, as Luk. 5. 7, 8. he might afterward haue said; Domine, in verbo tuo retia demisimus, and cepimus: Lord, at thy word, haue we let downe our nets, and haue caught, yea we haue caught abundantly: we haue fished for Godlinesse, and haue gotten Life eternall. For Rom. 2. 7. Vnto those that by patience and perseuerance in well doing haue sought for glory and honour and immortalitie, will the Lord giue eternall life in that day.
But let vs sift out, and see somewhat more particularly, wherein this spirituall Gaine consisteth.
First then, the speciall Wealth in this World, is that which commeth by Inheritance. Prov. 19. 14. Riches and possessions, land and liuing, saith Salomon, come from a mans auncestors. And among those things that may make a man happy, the Heathen man putteth this in the first place, as the chiefe, Res non parta labore, sed relicta. Martial. l. 10. epig. 47. Wealth and goods, not earned with ones hands, but left a man by his friends.
But as Virtus no^ est h^redit^^ia* sed nec pieta^. Philosophia non est res benefici^^ia. Senec. ep. 90. Virtue, so Pietie is not haereditarie. The one commeth not by kinde; neither is the other left by will: It is a greater legacie, than the mightiest Monarch that is, can bequeath to his heire.

For Psal. 16. 5. God himselfe is the inheritance of those that haue it.
Psal. 111. 5.God (saith the Psalmist) hath giuen a portion to them that feare him. If a Rich man giue one a Childes part, it is like to be a matter of some worth: Much more then if God giue a man a Childes part. But more then that, Psal. 142 5. he himselfe is the portion that he giueth vnto his. Psal. 119 57. Portio mea ipse es, Domine; saith Dauid; O Lord, thou art my portion. And, Qui dedit me mihi, d dit and se mihi. ^^rn in Psal. 90. He that bestowed my selfe vpon me, hath bestowed himself also vpon me, saith Bernard. And if Deut. 10. 9. and 18. 2. the Levites neede haue no inheritance among their brethren, because God is their portion; (it is sufficient, they haue him, that is, (...) G nes. 17. ^^. El shaddai, God all sufficient;) and yet that was but in a temporall manner: Much more then is the godly man wealthy enough, though he haue nothing in the world, though he haue no part among worldly men; seeing God is his portion in a spirituall manner, in a much better sort. He whose portion God is, cannot be poore.
We vse to say, that, He cannot lightly want money, that is Master of the Mint: and he can neuer be poore, Qui (...), vt est in Prouerbio; and, cum Plauti Misite, Auri mon^es, no^ massas, habet. that hath a well-spring of wealth. Psal. 34. 9. and 84. 11. Beatus home, cuius est Dominus spes eius, cui nihil deficit, quia Christus ei sufficit. Petrus Bles. epist. 102 Quantumlibet sis auarus, sufficit tibi Deus. Etenim vult avaritia terra^ possidere totam, adde and coelum; plus est qui fecit terram and coelum. Aug, in Ps. 55. Deum habens, omnia habes. Aug. de temp. 146. Quid tibi sufficit, si Deus non sufficit. Idem ad fratr. in crum. 51. 2 Cor. 6. 10. Much lesse then can that man want ought that is good, who is possessed of God himselfe, Iam. 1. 17. Omne enim bonu^ aut ipse est, aut ab ipse. Aug. de doct. Cor. l. 1. c. 31. ^6. 11. 36. the fountaine of all good. In regard whereof, Dauid hauing prayed for many temporall blessings in the behalfe of his people, Ps. 144. 12, 13, 14. that their Sonnes might be ^all and hardie like goodly yong Cedars; and their Daughters faire and comely, like the curious caruings about the Temple; their Oxen strong to labour, and their sheepe fertile and fruitfull; that there might (...) nor foraine invasion:

at length he windeth vp all indeed with this Epiphonema or Conclusion, Psal. 144 15. Blessed be the people that are in such a case: but on the neck of it he commeth as with an Epanorthoma, or a Correction of his former speech, Yea rather blessed are the people that haue Iehova for their God; that haue the Lord for their portion: This one blessing alone is better worth than all those. So that as when the woman in the Gospell cryed out to Christ, Luk. 11 27. Blessed is the wombe that bare thee, and the paps that gaue thee suck: Our Sauiour, as correcting her speech, (and yet Luk. 1. 48. true also that was) saith, Luk. 11. 28. Beatier Maria percipiendo fide^ Christi, quam concipiendo car^em Christi. Luk. 1. 45. Inde foelix quia verbum Dei custodivit. Luc. 2. 19. non quia in illa verbum caro factu^ est and habitauit in nobis; sed quia custodiuit Dei verbu^, per quod facta est, and quod in illo caro factum est. Aug. in Joan tract. 10. Blessed are those rather that heare Gods word and keep it. So the Psalmist haning pronounced them blessed that be in such a case, as eating in and revoking his words againe, as if he had spoken otherwise than well, Yea blessed (saith he) are they rather whose God is the Lord: As if he had said, That is indeed an happinesse in some kinde, in some case: but yet that happinesse is nothing to this blessednesse: for that is but externall, this is internall; that is but temporall, this is eternall.
Secondly, the greatest wealth in this world is of a Kingdome: and therefore said he sometime in the prophane Tragedie, that (...). Eteocles apud Eurip. Phoeniss. Nam si violandum est ius, regnandi gratia violandum est: alijs rebus pietatem ^olas. Cic. offic. l. ^. Nulla sancta societas, nec fides regni est. Ennius apud eund l. 1. Nulla fides regni socijs. Lucan. l. 1. If a man might breake his word for ought, it should be to atchieue a Crowne, to compasse a Kingdome. Yea not to be a King onely, but to belong to a King in some place neere about him, is esteemed a matter of great worth and dignitie, and such as may proue a meane of much wealth and commoditie to one that can wisely make vse of it. 1 King. 10. 8. They were held happy men that could get into Salomons seruice. And it is the greatest matter that

Prou. 22. 29. S^l^mon could promise the man that is diligent and industrious in the managing of his affaires, that he shall stand before, Sic ^ Reg. 17. ^. and Dan. 7. 10. that is, attend vpon Princes, and not serue or waite vpon any meane man.
If it be held such a matter then to retaine and belong to some one of the Princes of this world: De^ seruire regnare est. B^rn. de temp. 110. No^ maligno aut mundano princ^p^, ^^d Christ^ vtique seruire regnare est. Idem, de bon. deser. What is it to appertaine and belong to GOD, Apoc. 19. 16. 1 Tim 6. 15. the King of Kings, and Apoc. 1. 5. the Prince of Princes, Psal. 83. 18. the highest Soueraigne Luk. 10. 21. Lord of Heauen and Earth; Deponit reges, dispouit regna Dan. 2. 37. and 4. 22. that deposeth Kings and disposeth of their Kingdoms at his pleasure; that assign^th euery earthly King the lists and limits both of his regiment and of his reigne? That which the Apostle Paul therefore prefixeth as no small credit before sundry of his Epistles; and King Dauid as a great grace before some of his Psalmes: Rom. 1. 1. Philip. 1. 1. Tit. ^ 1. Paul a seruant of Iesus Christ: and, Psal. 36. 1. A Psalme of Dauid the seruant of God: as if it were Sanctitate maior quam p^^^state. Salnian, de prouid. l. 2. Quomodo de M. Ant^n^no Pe^rare. fam ep. 15 l. 7. Imperium adep^us philosophi nomen ro^inuit, maiu^ ^stima^s philosoph^ esse qua^ principem. Et de Theod^sio Aug. de ciuit. l. 5. c. 28. Ecclesi^ Dei se membru^ esse magis qua^ regnare gaudebat. a greater dignitie to him, that he was Gods seruant, then that he was ruler and gouernor of Gods people.
But because Joh 8. 35. the Seruant is oft-times turned out at dores, whereas the Sonne abideth in the house for euer: And therefore the Father telleth his Sonne in the Gospell; Luk. 15. 31. Sonne, thou art euer with me: and all that I haue is reserued for thee. The godly man is not onely Seruant to a King, but he is 1 Pet. 2. 9. Sonne to such a King, and Luk. 12. 3^. borne, or rather Ioh. 3. 3, 5. new-borne, to a Kingdome.
And whereas earthly Kings, if they haue many Sonnes, can leaue the Crowne but to one. ^ Chron. 21. 3. Iehosaphat (faith the Holy Historie) gaue great gifts to his other Sonnes, but the Kingdome gaue he to ^oram; because he was the eldest God (...) Apoc. 1. 6. and 10. 6. all his Sonnes

Kings and Apoc. 21. 7. Heires alike. For Rom. 8. 17. if we be Sonnes, saith the Apostle, we are Heires too; euen coheires with Christ, Hebr. 1. 2. who is Heire of all.
But how can the Godly be so rich may some say, when he hath, as it may fall out, not a penny in his purse?
Thirdly therefore: A man may truly be said to be Rich in writing; the monied man, though he haue neuer a penny in the house, but Hinc illud Pallade: (...) Et Po^^iani illud; (...) apud Stob. to^. 2. c. 10 all ou^ at interest; and the landed-man, though he hold not his lands in his owne hands, but haue all let out and in the occupation of others, so long as he hath good securitie for the one, and good euidence, if neede be, to shew, for the other. And as in Writing, so in Reuersion. Great summes of money do many giue for the reversions of offices, of lands and leases; and as much may they make them againe away for, if they will.
And in like manner may the Godly man be said to be rich both in Writing, and in Reuersion: yea in either kinde he is Affatim diues. est, qui cum Christo pauper est. Hieron. ad Heliodor. Diues pax, piet as, fides: fideli enim totus mundus possessio est, Ambr. ep. 10. Quibus l^cis circumscribitur, cui totus mundus diuitiaru^ possessio est?

And here come there two sorts of men to be admonished.
First, the Rich, that they content not themselues with their worldly wealth, but that they seeke withall to get the true spirituall Riches, that Animus hominis dives, non area appellari solet quamai^ illa sit plena du^ te inanem videbo divite^ non pu^abo. Cic. parad. 6. Ex anim^ rem stare ^quam puto, ^o^ animam exre. Auson. themselues may be rich, and not their purse or their chest only; that they may not be Luk. 12. 21. Est^te Deo divites, no^ ^^m facturi di^item, sed de ^o futuri divite^. Aug. de verb. Dom. 6. rich to the world onely, but rich also to God. Else their earthly Gaine will proue their losse; their worldly wealth will be but a meanes to hinder their happines by keeping them out of Heauen, where alone is true and entire happinesse to be had. It is that which our Sauiour himselfe saith of the worldly. Rich man, that hath nothing to trust vnto but his riches: (for so to his Apostles Mark. 10. 24. he expoundeth it himselfe:) that Math. 10. 24. Mark. 10. 25. Luk. 18. 25. It is easier for e a Camell; or, as some read the word, (...) Suid, Vise (...), and (...). a cable rope, to passe through the eye of a Needle, than for such a rich man to enter into the kingdome of Heaven. As if our Sauiour should haue said; It is as easie a matter, nay an easier, to thred a small Spanish Needle with a thicke Cable, or a great Cart-rope, then to

get such a Rich man in at heauen gate: In^pta eni^ sunt, quae ex Lyra^^ Autor Dialogi inter Divite^ and Pauperem, de portagarrit Hieros^lymitana, cui Acus nomen, per qua^ Cameli, ^isi s^cinis prius depositis introire ^eutiquam possent. That great bunched beast, a Camell, may as soone, yea sooner be driuen through an needles narrow eye, than such a rich man be drawne vnto God, and be brought into the state of Grace. For so the most and the best reade it; and it is an ordinarie by word both with Syrians and Greeks, when they speake of a thing that they thinke altogither impossible, to say, (...) Casaubou. in notis ad N^Test. An Elephant, or a Camell may as soone creepe through an Needles eye, as this or that come to passe. But not so soone, saith our Sauiour, but Difficilem dixerat, impossibile^ iam di^cit. Hieron. in Math. 3. i^o impossibili magis impossibilem. Euthym. in Math. c. 41. sooner may that be done, which Math. 19. 26. Mark. 10. 2^. with man is altogither impossible, than such worldly rich men attaine to true happinesse. 2 Cor. 8. 9. Diuilia illius quid nobis facturae, cuius paupertas no^ divites fecit? Aug. de verb. Apost. 15. Christ (saith the Apostle) became poore, to make vs Rich. Quomodo pauper factus est? quomodo divites facit? Aug. de temp. (...). How became he poore? saith one of the Ancients: ^^ how maketh he vs rich? The same Apostle (saith (...) sheweth vs, and expoundeth himselfe, where he saith; 2 Cor. (...). He that knew no sinne, for our sake became sinne, by taking vpon him the guilt of our sinne, that we might become the Puto quod Christi paupertas non pecuniam nobis attulit, sed iustitiam and immortalitare^. Aug. ibid. Righteousnes of God in him. And indeed, to speake properly and precisely, as the truth is, (...). Chrysost. tom. 6. serm. 78. de poenit. 2. not as the world, but as God reckneth, Mai^r and miserabilior egestas nulla est, quam egere sapientia, and qui sapientia non eget, nulla re omni^o egore potest. stultitia ergo egest at est. Aug. de beata vita disput. 3. Paupertas in animo est, non in sacoulo. Idem in Psal. 131. Paupertas in inopia mentis est, non in quantitate possessionis. Greg in Ezech. l. 2. hom. 18. the onely pouertie is Sinfulnesse, and In animo diuitia sunt, non inpatrimonio. Sen. ep. 108. Pa^u^ne divitia ipsa innocentia? si arcam plema^ auro habueris, diues eris: si cor habueris plenum innocentia, pauper er^^? Aug. in Psal. 83. Righteousnesse the right Riches. And the rich man therefore that hath

not a religious heart, is but like Apoc. 3. 17. proud Laodicea, Quid tibi prosunt exteriores diuitia, si te interior premit egestas? Aug. in Psal 52. Tanto eni^ verius, quanto interius indigentes sum^^. Greg. M. mor. l. 21. c. 14. a poore beggarly wretch in Gods sight, and in the sight of those that see so as he seeth, howsoeuer he may seeme rich and glorious in worldly mens eyes.
Yea to him that hath it too, that is both rich and religious, may we well say, as our Sauiour did to his Disciples, when they vaunted at their returne from preaching the Gospell, that euen the Diuels were subdued vnto them; Luk. 10. 20. Reioyce yee not herein, that the Diuels are subdued vnder you: so were they vnder Iudas too; but herein reioyce, that you haue your names entred in heauen. So Vise supra quod de Theodosio Aug. deciuit. Dei l. 5. c. 22. reioyce not herein that thou art rich to the world, or that thou art great in the world, and hast others vnder thee, and at thy command; that thou art clad gorgeously, and farest deliciously; (for Luk. 16. 19. so did that reprobate Rich man in the Gospell:) but herein reioyce that thou art rich vnto God, and 1 Pet. 3. 4. Vere diues, qui in Dei consp^ctu potest diues videri. Ambr. epist. 10. sed solum illum divitem D^us novit, qui sit diues aternitati. Ibid. in his sight, that thou fearest and seruest God, and 2 Cor. 1 12. labourest to keepe a good conscience, that thou art a 1 Pet. 4. 10.  carefull dispenser and faithfull disposer of that treasure that God hath entrusted thee withall. Then thou art 5 Paulo sap^e is omnis liber, 1 Cor. 7. 22. Peire etiam diues est. 1. Pet. 3. 4. Ambros. epist. 10 (...) Plato Ph^done. S lu^ sapient diues est Ci^ parad. 6. and apud Apul de philos. (...). etc. Philo de Nee. Qui pre^losissi^a qu^ sunt possidet, is diues est. ^iqui pretiosissi^^ res virtus est: hanc ergo cum sapions solus possideat; sapions solus diues est. Empir adv. Mathem. truely Rich, when thou art sincerely religious, when thou art truly righteous.
Secondly, the poore, they are likewise to be admonished, to labour for Godlinesse: that though they be not Luk. 12. 21. rich to the world, they may be rich yet to God; and their worldly pouertie shall be no hindrance to their spirituall preferment. For

Iam 2. 5. God (saith the Apostle) hath chosen the poore of this world to be rich in grace, and heires of his kingdome.
And here is great comfort for the poore man, that liueth a godly life, and maketh Conscience of his courses, hath a care to please God and to doe his will in all things, and to approue himselfe and his wayes to him, walking faithfully and painfully in the works of his calling, be it neuer so meane; that though he be neuer so poore and bare, though he liue but from hand to mouth, as we say; yea though he haue not one good rag to hang on his backe, or one good morsell of meat in a twelue-month to put in his mouth, though he haue not the least patch of land in the world to sustaine him, or the least hole that may be to hide his head in; Diuites dicimus sapientes, iustos, bonos; quibus pecunia vel parua vel nulla: magis eni^ sunt virtutibus diuites: pauperis vero auaros dicimus, semper inhiantes, semper egentes. Aug de ciu. l 7. c. 12. Pauper est pius? etiam sic diues est. intus diues, foris pauper: pauper in cella, diues in conscientia. arcam respicis auro inane^; conscientia respice Deo plenam: non habet extrinsecus facultatem; sed habet intrinsecus charitatem. Aug. in Ps. 36. and de temp. 212 Inops auri, Deo diues est. quid hac virtute pauperius? quid hac pauperiate ditius? Math. 5. 3. Idem de verb. Ap. 26. Nemo apud Deum pauper est, visi qui iustitia indiget: nemo diues, nisi qui virtutibus plenus est. Lactant. instit. l. 5. c. 14. yet is he a rich man for all that, richer than Crassus or Croesus, or the wealthiest worldly man again in the world. For they haue but Luk. 16. 11. the false Riches, he the true treasure; they haue but the counterfait Vitreum margaritum, non verum. Hieron. post Tertull. glassie pearle; he hath that precious orient pearle, which Math. 13. 46. the wise Merchant, when he hath found, is content to sell all that euer he hath to purchase it, to forgo all that euer he is worth for the compassing of it; and yet is he no looser by the bargaine neither. For as he is a Merchant, so is he also a wise Merchant; and therefore knoweth well what he doth in so doing: he knoweth that in buying it, he buyeth himselfe and his owne safetie, his own eternall saluation, togither with it.
Againe, this serueth to ouerthrow the opinion of such persons as thinke that there is litle or no Gaine

to be gotten vnder God, litle or no good at all to be gathered in Gods seruice. So the worldly men in Iobs day; Iob. 21. 15. Who is the All-sufficient, say they, that we should serue him? or what profit should we haue by praying vnto him? And the wicked in Malachies time; Malac. 3. 14. It is but in vaine to serue God: there is nothing to be gotten by keeping his commandements, and walking humbly before him.
Yea but, may some say, sure there be none such now a-dayes, especially among vs that make profession of Christianitie; and therefore this vse of the point might well be spared.
If it be so with vs, Quiescat lingua, loquaturvita. Aug. in 1. Ioan. Efficacius est testimonium vita quam lingua. Aut^r de dupl martyr. let our Actions answer for vs; let our practise proue it: And so we will turne the Vse from Reprehension to Examination, from Confutation to Conviction.
Let euery one by these Notes then examine himself, whither he be of this Opinion or no.
First, did men deeme Godlinesse to be a matter of Gaine, they would neuer thinke they had enough of it. For (...)

Aug. de temp. 246. rifer oft with them then euer, when they are euen going out of the world, and haue one foot, as we vse to say, already in the graue.
But with Godlinesse men are soone satisfied; they haue soone enough of it. If they haue attained to but a litle superficiall sprinkling of common Grace, or ciuill honestie, that commeth as far short of sound sanctification and sinceritie, as the shadow doth of the substance; they begin presently to suppose, with selfe-conceited Apoc. 3. 17. Laodicea, that they are rich enough and neede nothing; that Quomodo proficis, fi tibi ^am sufficis? Bern. de consider. l. 2. Omnia i^^ desunt, qui sibi nihil deesse putat.

Hieron in Eccles. Iustitia enim, nisi misericordi^ temperetur, in crudelitatem degenerat, Lav^^ in Eccles. Huc illud Plinij hist. nat. l. 18. c. 6. Nihil minus expedire, quam agrum optim^ colere. Et, Agrum bend colere necessarium, optime damnosum. being ouer-rigorous in censuring of others; like Luk. 18. 11. the Pharisee in the Gospell, who, saith an ancient Writer very pithily and wittily, Dum in se singulariter ^^^^tat, aliji arroganter insultat; and se solum decipit, quem solum excipit, dum al^^^ damnat. Lern. de grad. humil. exulting arrogantly in himselfe insulteth insolently ouer others, and deceiueth himselfe alone, whom alone he excepteth, while he

contemneth and condemneth all besides himselfe.
Secondly, Men would striue one to go beyond an other in Godlinesse, if they counted Godlinesse a matter of Gaine. For as the Heathen Writer well obserueth, * (...). Hesiod. Vicimus diues cupiditatem irritat. Sen. epist. 7. there is a kinde of emulation commonly among worldly neighbors, whereby they emulate such as goe beyond them in wealth: one neighbour striueth to out-build an other, one to get and purchase more than another. The couetous man casteth his eye on his rich neighbors, * hunc atque hune superare laborat: Vt quum carceribus ^^ss^s rapit vngula currus Instat equis auriga suos vincentibus illum praeteritum temnens eutremos inter euntem. Herat. serm, l. 1. sat. 1. as a man in a race doth on those that haue won ground of him, he striueth to get euen with this man, whom he is yet behind, to out-strip that man, whom he hath got euen withall. And the enuious man (as those two vices are seldome asunder) looking through the spectacles of enuie on his neighbours goods, Fertilier seges est alienis semper in aruis: vicinumque pecus grandius vber ^abet. Ovid. artis l. 1. (...) nobis, nostra (...)t. P. Syrus.-maior^ videtur, Et melior vi^^na seges. Juven: sat. 14. thinketh euery thing that his neighbor hath better than his own and it may be better than indeed it is, his grounds fertiler, his beasts fairer, his revenues larger, his gaines greater etc. and is ready enough oft to say with himselfe, Why should not my beasts looke a^ ^^ire a^ hi^? why should not my grounds yeeld as much as hi^? why should not I thrine as well as he, hauing as good ^^dnes to thrine by a^ he hath
And euen (...). Plat^ d^ (...). ^. so wo^^^^ be with vs, held we Godlinesse to be gainefull. We would haue a kinde of godly emulation and ambition among vs, as the Apostle speaketh, in matter of Godlinesse; we would euen (...). 1. Cor. 12. 31. (...). 1. Cor. 14. 1. (...). 2. Cor. 9. 2. emulate, and (...). Rom. 15. 2^. ^ Cor. 5. 9. 1. Thess. 4. 11. ambitiously, as it were, striue

and contend to out-go one an other in goodnes and grace. And this were (...). Hesiod. a good and godly emulation, a goodly and a commendable strife and contention indeed. We would be eying of those that are got beyond vs in grace, and endeuour to get euen with them, yea, if it be possible, to out-strip them, and to cast them behind vs, Qui stadium currit, eniti and contendere debet, quam maxime possit, vt vincat: supplantare eum qu^cum certet, aut manis depellere nullo modo debet. Chrysippu^ apud Cicer. offic. l. 3. not by hindring their progresse, but by mending our owne pace, and Faciamus quod in itinere fieri solet: qui tardius exieru^t, velocitate pe^sant moram. Senec. nat. quaest. l. 3. praefat. Quod facere solent, qui serius exeunt, and volunt tempus celeritate reparare, calcar add^mus. Idem epist. 68. by straining our selues to runne the faster, the later it was ere we entred into this race. We would be as ready as they are to say to our selues; And why should not I be as forward in the feare of God, as Zealous, as religious, as I see such and such are, since I haue as good meanes of being godly as they haue, as many inducements as either they or any other can haue?
But so stand the most affected, that they will not by their good will suffer any man to out-go them in wealth, in the way of the world: but they will let any man willingly out-go them in grace, and in the good wayes of God: there onely we straine courtesie, and giue euery one the way of vs. And as our Sauiour telleth the Scribes and Pharisees, that Math. 21. 31. the very Publicans and Harlots might go into the kingdome of Heauen before them: So not a few among vs will suffer the very Pagans, and Papists, litle better than Pagans, if not worse many of them than they, the very Heathen and Heretikes to go into heauen before them, ere they will striue to out-go them in goodnes and godlinesse.
Thirdly, men would be more affected with it, if they supposed any matter of Gaine to be in it. Populus me sibilat; at mihi plau do Ipse domi, simulat nummos contemplor in arca. Horat. serm. l. 1. sat. 1. The couetous miser, saith the Heathen man, while the

people either curse or hi^^e at him abroad, yet he pleaseth and cheereth himselfe the whilest with the sight or the consideration of his substance at home. It doth a man good at the very heart, euen to thinke vpon his riches, and but Eccles. 5. 10. to looke vpon his treasure. It will make our hearts to spring and leap within vs for ioy, to haue sodaine newes brought vs of some rich legacie, or large patrimonie by some meanes befallen vs.
But of this spirituall wealth and gaine most men are meerely stupide and senseles: No more moued commonly or affected, when either, (if any time at least they so do,) they thinke on it, or when they heare it spoken of in the Pulpit; then (as a Philosopher said sometime of an ignorant Dol^ ^itting in the Theater, where the seats were of marble, that (...). Aristipp^^ apud L^^^tium l. 2. One stone sate vpon an other:) then, I say, either the benches that they sit vpon, or the pillers that they leane against: Not once stirred at all to heare of the heauenly inheritance, or of holinesse, the meanes that must bring them to heauen, yea that worketh in mens hearts a kinde of Philip. 3. 20. heauen vpon earth, and giueth Christian men seizin of heauen euen while they liue here. An euident argument that either they beleeue not the Gaine of it, or they beleeue not themselues to haue any share in it.
Fourthly, men would be oft taking account of their Gaines in this kinde, of their thriuing in Godlinesse, if they held Godlinesse to be so gainefull. (...). Worldly men are very frequent and diligent herein, very carefull to keepe their bookes of receipt and expense, poaring euer and anon on them, running

oft ouer their reckonings, and casting vp their accounts, to see how they thriue or pare in the world, how they goe forward or backward in wealth.
But where we shall finde a man that hath the like care of keeping and casting vp his spiritual accounts, of Ps 4. 4 and 119. 59. Zeph. 2. 1. 1. Cor. 11. 28. 2. Cor. 13. 5. examining himselfe for his spirituall estate, how he thriueth or pareth with the graces of Gods Spirit, how he goeth forward or backward in goodnes or Godlinesse? And yet would our care be alike for either, did we equally apprehend the gaine of either. But let vs looke vnto it. For whither we call our selues to account here or no, God will questionlesse one day call vs to an account. And then not onely Luk. 15. 13. the prodigall Sonne, and the Luk. 16. 1. vnfaithfull Steward, that hath the one vnthriftily lauished out his patrimonie, and the other riotously wasted his masters wealth; but Math. 25. 30. the idle and vnprofitable Seruant to^, that hath not gained with his Talent, that hath not thriuen with the Grace of God bestowed on him, shall be bound hand and foot, and cast out into vtter darknes, where shall be weeping and wailing, and gnashing of teeth.
Fiftly, men would make more account of Godlinesse, if they counted it as Gaine. Did they indeed account Godlinesse more gainefull than Gaine, they would not put Godlinesse away for Gaine, they would not prefer Gaine before Godlinesse. Yea did they deeme Godlinesse the gainfullest thing in the world, they would not forgo Godlinesse for a world of wealth, or for ought else that were in the world.
But it is with it, as it is with Time. It is a common

saying in euery mans mouth, that (...). Theophrastus apud L^^rtium and Anti^ho apud Plutarch. Antonio. There is nothing in the world more precious than Time, and yet Quem mihi dabis qui preti^ aliquod tempori p^nat. ^en. epist. 1. Non exig^u^ temp^^ is habemus, sed multu^ perdimus: non ^^^pes eius, sed prodigi sumus astricti sunt homines in con^inend^ patrimonio: simul ad temporis iactur ^m ^e^tum est, prof^siss^mi in eo, ^uius vnius auari ia honesta est. Idem de brev, vit. c. 1 and 3. there is nothing generally more trifled away than it. So of Godlinesse the most will (in word at least) acknowledge, that there is nothing in the world more gainefull than it, and yet the most of them that so say, sticke not to make it away for meere trifles. Ad mere^^^ ^ij sumus; ad mercede^ impij. honesta q^a^d^^ aliqua illis spes inest, sequi^ur: in co^^ra^ium transi^^^i, si plus scelera promi^^^nt. Senec. epist 113. Et genus and virtus, nisi cum re, vilior alga est. Horat. serm. lib. 2. sat 5. Godly they are content to be for aduantage, so long as Godlines bringeth in any worldly Gaine with it, or so long as there is no hope of any the like Gaine by vngodlinesse. But let Godlinesse cease to bring in such Gaine, they grow soone weary of it: or let but the least hope of such Gaine by vngodlinesse shew it self, and they are ready presently to exchange Godlinesse for it.
Matth. 16. 26.What should it auaile a man, saith our Sauiour, to winne the whole world, and loose his owne soule? It were no Gaine for a man to get the whole world by vngodlinesse; since he must withall loose himselfe, his life, his soule for his labour. But we are ready and willing, the most of vs, to part with Godlinesse, and forgo good Conscience, for far lesse matters then that commeth to, for a penny or an halfe-penny toy now and then; to exchange it for some small peece or patch of the world, for some sory snip or stired of the pelfe of it, or for ought else that we haue some fond fancie vnto, the couetous worldling for a litle temporarie treasure, and the lasciuious wanton for a litle transitorie pleasure: like Hebr. 1^. 13. ex Gen. 25. 33. prophane Es^^, that sold his birth-right for a messe of broth, and Pr. 28 21. Frusto pa^^^ co^^^ci potest, vel vti tac^at, v^l vti loqu^^ur. ^ato in C^liu^ apud G^lliu^ l. 1. c. 15. Salomons vniust iudge, that would d^ (...) (...) a (...)se^^ of bread, and

Ezech. 13. 9. the false Prophets in Eechiels time, that would pollute Gods name for an handfull of barly.
That which euidently sheweth at how low a rate most men value Godlinesse. For as a Abst^m: in fabulis. scoffing companion sometime told the Bishop that would giue him his blessing when he would not giue him an halfe-penny, that If his blessing had bin worth an halfe-penny, he should not haue had it. So if worldly men thought Godlinesse, and the Feare and Fauour of God worth but an halfe-penny, they would not venture to put either away for an halfe-penny matter: they would not so readily exchange either for trifles, did they not make but a trifling matter of either.
Neither may the greater sort of such men auoide this imputation, and wash their hands with Math. 27. 24. Pilate from the soile of this sinne, because they are wont to make Godlinesse away for greater matters. To omit (...). Plato apud Plut. de vtil. ex inimic. Thesaur^^ omnibus pretiosior est vir^us. Apul. de Philosoph. (...). Euripid. apud Stob. to^. 2. c. 1. Vilius argentum est auro, virtutibus auru^. Horat. epist. Virtus praemium est optimum: virtus omnibus reb^^ anteit. Plaut. Amphitr. 2. 2. that euen the greatest of them will beare no weight at all, if they be laid in the ballance against Godlinesse, when the whole world it selfe is too light to weigh against it. Thou thy selfe, who euer thou art, wilt cry out shame on some poore silly wretch, that shall forsweare himselfe, and so damne his soule, as thou thy selfe saist, for a penny, when thou dost thy selfe, it may be, in effect as much for somewhat more. But do thou consider, as (...). Aristippus apud Laert. l. 2. Aristippus sometime told Plato, that a penny may be as much to him as a pound is to thee, and a pound no more with thee than a penny with him: and therefore doest thou value Godlinesse at as low a rate in stretching and straining of thy Conscience

for the one, as he in tentering it for the other.
Lastly, men would be content to take more paines for the compassing and increasing of it in themselues, if they held Godlinesse to be gainefull. Men can well endure to sit telling and taking money, and it were all day long, from morning to dark night: But to heare the word, but an houre, whereby the spirituall Gaine is gotten, the most can hardly endure: they sit all that while on thornes, and thinke euery minute an houre, and are neuer well till all be done. They say, or thinke at least with themselues, as the prophane Iewes sometimes said, (...) Malac. 1. 12. What a toyle, or a tediousnes is here? what needeth so much preaching? what needeth so long praying? they thinke they might be as well, if not much better, without either: Yea many can not endure so long as till the houre be at an end. To whom God may well say, as our Sauiour to his drowsie Disciples, Math. 26. 40. What, could yee not watch an houre with me? So, Can yee not endure to waite an houre on me, that watch so many ouer you? On Si ab isia hora, qua verbum Dei praedicare ceperim, gemm^s, vel annulos, vel monilia erogarem, an non filij mei stare and accipere vellent? etc. Aug. homil. 26. worldly Mammon they could be well content to waite all day long, with forbearance not of disport onely, but of ordinarie diet too, that would thinke much but halfe an houre in the day to waite vpon him.
Againe, (...). Antipha apud Stob. c. 10. Cogit auarities miser^s and caca cupido Noctes at^ dies niti praest^^te labore, Lu^^^^. de nat. rer^m lib. 3. for worldly wealth men can toile and moile all the weeke long; and yet are they not wearie; they thinke not the whole weeke long enough neither: But for the heauenly Gaine, for the spirituall thrift, we haue but one day of seuen, and we

thinke that too much too: we thinke the day all too long, the labour all lost, and the whole time cast away, that we imploy and spend to this purpose. We say as the same Iewes at an other time said; Amos 8. 5. When will the New Moone be past; and the Sabbath once ouer? that we may returne againe vnto our worldly affaires. Yea many among vs haue not the patience to tarry so long, but spend a great part of the Sabbath, that is Gods Market or Mart-day, for the getting of this spirituall Gaine, either about their worldly affaires. or their bodily delights.
The Sabbath day, I say, is Gods Market-day. And those that seeke to take away the Sabbaths, attempt to put downe Gods Markets, and so do the Deuill good seruice, whatsoeuer their intent be. As frequenting of Markets maketh a Rich man; so keeping of Sabbaths maketh a rich Christian. And as we count him a bad Husband, that followeth Game on the Market-day: so may we as well count him a spirituall vnthrift, that spendeth the Sabbath in that sort.
But may some say, when we haue bin at Church, and heard the Sermon and Seruice, is not Gods Market-day then done?
I answer: If the Sabbath be Lecit. 23. 32. Matth. 28. 1. a day, then is it not so soone done. Debet totus dies festium a Christiano expendi in operibus sanctis. Rob. Grosthed Lincoln. Epist. in Decalog. pracept. 3. Gods Market lasteth all day long.
Yea, grant the principall, because the publike, of it bee past: yet as Market-folks returning from Market will bee talking of their Markets, as they goe by the way, and be casting vp of

their penny-worths, when they come home, reckon what they haue taken, and what they haue laid out, and how much they haue gotten: So should we, after we haue heard the word publikely, conferre priuately of it with others; at least meditate on it by our selues, and be sure to take an account of our selues, how we haue profited that day by the word that hath bin spoken vnto vs, and by other religious exercises that haue bin vsed of vs. And as the Marketman counteth that but an euill market-day, that he hath not gained somewhat on more or lesse: So may we well account it an euill Sabbath to vs, whereon we haue not profited somewhat, whereon we haue not either increased our knowledge, or bin bettred in affection; whereon we haue not bin further either informed in iudgment, or reformed in practise, whereon we haue added no whit at all to our Talent.
To winde vp all in a word. If we hold Godlinesse to be, as the Apostle here saith it is, a matter of Gaine, and of great Gaine, that which maketh Gaine to be Gaine, and without which Gaine it selfe is no Gaine indeede; that Omnia adsunt bona, quem penes est virtus. (pietas.) Plaut. Amphitr. 2. 2. it bringeth all good with it to him that hath it; and that it neuer leaueth him, but abideth with him, and sticketh by him for euer: Oh let vs labour then to get of it, and to grow more and more in it; let vs endeuor to out-go one an other in Godlinesse; let vs call our selues to a reckoning how we thriue or pare in it; let vs (...).

Deuill shall tender vnto vs to bereaue vs of so pretious a pearle; Especially let vs haue a care of frequenting Esai. 55. 1. Gods markets, of obseruing Gods Sabbaths, the principall meanes of increasing this spirituall wealth in vs. So shall it come to passe that we shall haue God to be our portion; we shall be heires of his Kingdom, and coheires with his Christ; we shall haue all the good things both of this life and the next assured vnto vs here, and the full fruition of them for euer hereafter.
The end of the first Part.




THE SECOND PART. The Sufficiencie of it in it Selfe.
HItherto of the maine Point, to wit, that Godlinesse is great Gaine. Now because this Proposition will not either easily enter into mens mindes, or sinck sodainely into their hearts: The Holy Ghost by the Apostle is content to bring a double proofe of it.
The one drawne from the time present; because it is able alone to giue a man Contentment here, that which all the world else is not able to do, expressed in this verse:
The other taken from the time to come; because it will continue with and abide by a man for euer hereafter, that which no worldly wealth, or ought else in the world can doe, implied in the Vers. 7. next verse.
Godlinesse with Contentment, or, (...) with Self-sufficiencie: For so it is word for word in the Originall; and the word so properly importeth. As if he had said: Godlinesse and Contentment are two inseparable Companions, that continually harbour and keepe house

togither, that go euer hand in hand the one with other: so that a man can not haue the one without the other, he cannot want the one if he haue the other. There is no true Godlinesse, where there is not Contentment of Minde; no true Contentment of Minde, where Godlinesse is not.
So that the Apostle seemeth to reason on this wise.

That which of it selfe is sufficient to content the minde of Man, that is true Gaine, and great Gaine indeed: For it is no small matter that will suffice to stay and settle Mans minde.


But Godlinesse is of it selfe sufficient to content the Minde of Man, and doth euer bring true Contentment with it to him that hath it.


Godlinesse therefore is true Gaine and great Gaine indeede.

Hence then may we deduce these three Conclusions to be considered of in order:
1. That Contentment of Minde is a most pretious Treasure.
2. That Godlinesse alone can produce and procure this Contentment.
3. That true Contentment is an vndoubted Argument of Godlinesse.
For the first: (...). Epicur. ap ud Laert. Contentment of Minde is an vnvaluable, an inestimable Treasure. For it is that indeed that maketh Riches to be Riches.

So that where Contentment is not, a man regardeth nothing: and where Discontent is, it infecteth and tainteth all things, and so maketh them, as if some malignant blast had blowne on them, vnsauoury and distastfull to him that so hathr Non domne and (...) a (...) corpor(...)Non animo cu^as, No^* op. 2. l. 1. them, rather sicke of them, than endowed with them.

Sen. ep. 17. A sicke man is alike sicke, wheresoeuer ye

So no more can riches, gold and siluer, land or liuing, had a man much more than euer any man had, minister vnto him much ioy, yea or any true and sound ioy at all, where the minde is distract and discontent: without Contentment there is no ioy of ought; there is no profit, there is no pleasure in ought. Eccles. 2. 10. All without it is but vanitie and vexation of Spirit.
Will we see this by an Example or two further confirmed to vs? Haman, was he not a most happy man, as the world accounteth happinesse, Nemo foelix est, qui iudicio suo miser est. Salvian. de provid. lib. 1. Non est beatus, esse se qui non putat. P. Syr. Miser est qui. se non beatissimum iudicat. Sen. ep. 10. if he could haue thought so himselfe? Ester 3. 1, 2. the next man in the Kingdome to the King himselfe, the greatest one of them that then was; he tooke place by the Kings appointment of all the Princes his Peeres, and all the Kings Court, by the Kings expresse command, bowed and did obeysance to him: Ester 5. 13. he vaunteth himselfe of his glory, the multitude of his children, the abundance of his treasure, his especiall fauour and inwardnes both with the King and the Queene: enough a man would thinke to content any man Egens aque est is qui non satis habet, and is cui nihil satis potest esse. Cornif. ad Herenn. l. 4. that had not an vnmeasurable minde. And yet, saith he, that is the conclusion of his discourse, Ester. 5. 13. O dives, nescis quam pauper fis. quam inops tibi ipsi videris, qui te divite^ dicis? Ambr. de Nabuth. cap. 2. all this doth me no good: It was all as good as nothing to him; he was neuer the better for all this, so long as he wanted a cap and a courtesie of Mordecai; because Mordecai bowed not the knee vnto him, nor adored him, as other the Kings Courtiers did. It was with him, (...) Plut. de tranquill. as with litle children, (saith an Heathen man well of such) playing in the streets, who,

if some man as he passeth by take one of their toyes from them, are ready to cast all the rest away from them, though they haue many more left, and sit crying and whining for that one that is gone.
Passe we from a Kings fauourite to a King himselfe. King Ahab had land and liuing enough and enough, (much more than 1. King. 16. 16. his Father Omri was euer borne to,) had he not wanted this Contentment of minde. But 1. King. 21. 1, 2, 3, 4. the litle Vineyard of his poore Neighbour was such an eye-sore to his greedy affection, that the discontent that he conceiued, because he could not presently compasse it, Duos sinitimos historia vetus describit, Regem A. and paupere^ N. que^ horum pauperiorem, quem d^iorem credimus? alter regali fulcro divitiarum praeditus, exiguam pauperis vinee^ desideravit: alter animo despiciens regias gazas, suo erat contentus palmite. an non hic magis dives, magis Reu, qui sibi abundabat, cupiditates suas regiba^, vt alieni nihil concupisceret: ille autem egentissi^us, cui auru^ suum vilt, al^^nus palmes pretiofissimus erat?

Idem de Nabuth c. 2. made him poorer than poore Naboth, that desired nothing that he had; and depriued him of his whole Kingdome that he had no profit of it, tooke no pleasure in it; but, like a man that were in extreme want and necessitie, he getteth him home to his house, and shutteth himself vp in his Chamber, like one that durst not be seen abroad for feare of arrests; he casteth himself on the bed and refuseth his meat, like a man that tooke thought for the payment of his debts: He fareth, in a word, as the former Author saith of such, (...). Plut. de tranquill. like a sullen Hen, that hauing store of barly lieng by her, getteth her aside into some corner, and forsaking her meat, scrapeth alone by her selfe, there to finde somewhat that she may be picking vp out of the dunghill.
Yea come we to them that were indeede Lords of the whole world, not in title onely, but in truth, hauing and injoying that by Gods free gift, that none since them were euerable to come any thing

neere, much lesse to attaine vnto. Genes. 3. 1, 2, 3. Adam and Eve our first Parents, albeit they were in the garden of Eden, (a place abounding, as (...) Paradisii voluptatis. Vulg. hortos delicatissimos. Leo Iud. the word importeth, with matter of pleasure and delight) amids all earthly happinesse; and had the whole world in their hands, and all the Creatures at command: yet no sooner had the Diuell sowen this vnhappy seede of Discontent (the very first sinne of theirs, as I take it with some other Reuerend) in their hearts, but they began presently to deeme themselues poore and in want, because they had not what they would; they account themselues as depriued and debarred of all things, if they may not haue the fruit of that one tree that was only denied them, and Gen. 2. 17. of which God had foretold them, that whensoeuer Gen. 3. 3. they touched it or tasted of it, it would be their bane. As if some great rich man, or mighty Monark, hauing wealth in abundance, and the world at will, euen whatsoeuer heart could wish, yet should thinke himselfe streitned and cut short, but a miserable creature, or not so happy as he might be, because he can not, with Harpalum Alexandro mandante omni modo admisu^, vt hederam in paradisis Babyloni adiacentibus sereret, frustra fuisse, narrant Theophr. hist. plaut. l 4. c. 4.

Plut. de tranq. longing after his owne euill, when he hath good enough at hand, as if it were miserie for a man to want that, though he haue no neede of it, that would but hurt him if he had it. Ye see, that a man may be in Paradise, (I might well say, in heauen too, as the Diuell

once was,) and yet not be happy, if he haue not a contented minde.
As on the other side, where this Contentment of Minde is, there is wealth euen in want, much more cheerefulnes in wealth: There is, as a stay of the desire, so a resting and a reioycing in that a man enjoyeth: and therefore a comfortable vsage of it, be it more or lesse, because content in it. It is that alone that seasoneth all: it is that alone that sweetneth all: It is that that is able, not onely to season those things that are sweet and pleasant in their owne nature, but euen Animus ^q^^^ optimu^ est ^rum^^ condimentu^.

It is Contentment therefore onely that maketh a man truly wealthy, because it freeth him from want, and giueth him comfort of that he hath. And as a (...).

Now two wayes may this point bee vsefull vnto vs.
First, to informe vs, what cause they haue to be thankfull vnto God, be they rich or poore, whom he hath vouchsafed this grace vnto, whom Philip. ^. 11, 12. he hath taught, in whatsoeuer estate they are, therewith to be content. For euen the poorest man that liueth content with his present estate, is richer than the richest

man in the world that hath not a contented minde: he is happier than Adam and Eve were sometime in Paradise, when they longed to eat of the fruit forbidden them: Sensit Alexander test a cum vidit in illa Mag^u^ habitatorem, quanto foelicior is, qui Nil cup^ret, quam qui totum sibi posceret (possidet) orbem.

Alexander apud Plut. he sa^ weeping and wailing, like a forlorne person, that he could not finde out a new world to be winning. Whereas, by benefit hereof many a poore Childe of God, that hath not halfe that that he had, yea that hath not a patch of land in the world, but liueth from hand to mouth by his daily labour, yet passeth his time as merrily, (as that Cynick sometime told his hoast at Athens) as if (...)

The poore man then hath as great cause to be thankfull to God for his Contentment of minde, as^ (...) omnes ^ies afflict^ mali. Sic^^ Gen. 47* 9. and Math. 6. 34. the Rich man for his riches. Conceiue it by this Comparison. Suppose two men lye sicke of the same disease, a burning Fever, or some such like hot disease, as causeth drought and desireth drinke, and call both instantly for cold water to quench their thirst with. The Physitian comming to them, biddeth giue the one that is more impatient, a good quantitie of cold drinke, and yet he cryeth and calleth still for more. To the other he ministreth himselfe a litle cons^rue on the point of a knife, that slaketh his thirst and asswageth his drought. Whether of the twaine in this case is more beholden vnto him?

Whether of the twaine, thinke we, haue more cause to be thankfull vnto him, and to acknowledge his goodnes towards them? The latter doubtles, as he enioyeth the greater benefit, so he hath greater cause of thankfulnes to him from whom he hath it.
Againe this may serue to incite vs to labour earnestly for this Contentment, and to pray instantly vnto God for it.
And it is hard here to say, whether a man had more neede to perswade the poore man to be content with his pouertie, or the rich man with his riches. For as Matth. 2. 9. the Star that went before the Wisemen, went when they went, and stayed where they stayed: So H (...) Chryso^t. in 1. Cor. h^m. 14.

Till that be, ^^gg. 1. 6. all is put (as the Prophet speaketh in another case) into a broken bag, that will hold nothing, or (...). Dion. Chrysost. ^ra^. 47. into a bottomles barrell, as the prouerbe is, that is neuer a whit the fuller for all that is put in: And we are but like those that haue a flux, that take in much, but retaine nothing, and so thriue not with their meat, are nothing fuller or fatter for it, till this (...) ani^i prost^nium, qu^ laborant, isti, quomodo (...) illi Athen: l. 4. spirituall loosenesse of ours be by Contentment stayed with vs.
As Num. 9. 17, 18. the Children of Israel therefore passing along the wildernesse, marched forward on their way when the Cloud went that conducted them, but there stood still where it stayed. So may our affections walke on, while Gods hand goeth before them: but looke where God stayeth his hand and ceaseth to giue, there should our heart stay likewise, and we cease to desire.
To perswade our hearts the rather hereunto, vse we a double consideration, concerning others, and concerning our selues.

If no wealth then can stay, or satisfie the minde of man, what must? or what may? The Apostle pointeth vs to it, as here, so els where. Heb. 139. It is good, saith he, to haue the heart stayed, or ballaced as it were, with grace, and not with meats, nor with money neither. That that must keepe the ship stiffe and steedy on the Sea, must not be leauers and shores without it, but Namque labant curvae iusto fi^e pondere naves, Perque mare instabiles nimia l^uitate ^eruntur. Ovid. met. l. 2. weight and ballast within it. So

that that must stay a mans raging and ranging desires, must not be the outward supporting of his worldly estate, but the inward ballacing and setling of the heart and minde; that which Gods grace alone can do, as the Apostle speaketh there, which is the same in effect with Godlinesse, of which he intreateth here. And in regard hereof it is that the Psalmist saith, that Psal. 37. 16. A small matter to the godly, the man that feareth God, is much better than the greatest wealth and riches, that the vngodly and the mighty hath or can haue. And Salomon, that Prov. 15. 16. a litle with the feare of God is much better than great treasures and trouble or vexation therewith.
In which words also Salomon closely and couertly rendreth a reason of that which his Father Dauid had before him said, why A litle to the godly man should be of more worth, euen the same in effect that the Apostle here hath, because there is no trouble or vexation of minde, but quietnesse and sweet contentment withall. According to that which the same Salomon els-where saith; Pro. 10 22. (...) Aeschyl. Theb. It is Gods blessing that maketh a man truly rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it. 1.

Aug. de diuers. 20. ^ Psal. 106. 15. God giueth a man money many times in his wrath: as in the wildernes he gaue the Israelites meat in his anger: And so the curse of God many times maketh a man rich: But those riches are but accursed riches; Multis parasse divitias non fini^ miseriaru^ suit, sed mutatio. S^n. ep. 17. Du^ maiore torme^to pecunia possidet^r, quam queritur. ^a^ epist. 115. Nemo solicito bono fruitur. Ide^. ep. 14. Ta^lis parta mal^ (...)tuque (...). Misera est (...).

withall contentment, that causeth comfort and quiet of minde, and maketh a man rest satisfied and well apaid with that portion of wealth, be it more or lesse, that God hath assigned him.
Neither is this a common courtesie that God casteth on all sorts indifferently; but a peculiar blessing that he bestoweth on those onely that loue and feare him, and that are his beloued ones. Psal. 128 1, 2. Blessed is euery one, saith the Psalmist, that feareth God, and that walketh in his wayes: For thou, that so doest, shalt eat of the (...) Sept. quod vetus interpr.

Id quod Augustinu^, Prosperu^que Latinos latuisse parum fuerit; Origenem Gratum in Ro^. c. 1. fe^^llisse mirum. labours of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall go well with thee. But, c Vnlesse the Lord build the house, they labour but in vaine that build it: It is vaine for you, as worldly men are wont to do, to rise vp early in the morning, and sit vp late at euening, and toile and moile, like an horse, all the day long, and to eat the bread of sorrow and care; for, it is God that giueth his beloued rest: It is he alone that can giue sweet comfort, and quietnes, and contentment of minde, and this grace he vouchsafeth to none but his beloued, to the Godly that loue him, and are beloued of him.
It is Godlinesse then alone, that can cause true Contentment; and that can cause true Contentment alone.
Godlinesse alone is able to cause true Contentment: because Godlinesse alone bringeth man home vnto God, out of whom true Contentment can not be had. For the soule of man, as Genes. 1. 26, 27. and 9. 5. 1. Cor. 11. 7. Ephes. 4. 24. it beareth the image of God; so Psal. 17. 15. Omnis copia qu^ non est Deus meus, mihi est egestas.

But it is Godlinesse alone, that bringeth man home vnto God; that tyeth and knitteth the soule fast vnto God; whereof Hoc vin^ulo pietatis obst^^^^, Deo relig^^^ sumu^, vnde and ips^ Relig(...)accepi^, (...).

That which Salomon, out of his owne experience, confirmeth vnto vs, who Eccles. ^. ^^, 11. hauing ranged abroad through all those creatures and courses, vnder the cope of heauen, wherein any hope of contentment seemed to shew forth it selfe, is in conclusion inforced to retire backe againe to God, Eccles. ^^. 1. directing them all to him that desire to finde true contentment, and pointing them the way to him Eccles. ^2. ^^. by the feare of

him; that is, by Godlinesse leading them vnto God, that they may with him and in him finde true Contentment, as being no where else to be had.
Godlinesse then, you see, is alone able to cause true Contentment. But is Godlinesse, may some say, able to cause true Contentment alone, without helpe and aide of these outward things? Can it make a man content as well in want as in wealth? whither he haue worldly wealth or no?
Yea vndoubtedly. That that is sufficient of it selfe alone to make a man truly happy, is of it selfe alone sufficient to giue true contentment, though a man haue nothing else but it.

Ibid. 45. the Heathen men said of their morall Virtue, a meere shadow of it, is indeed true of true Godlinesse, it is sufficient of it selfe to make him that hath it truly happy, though he haue nothing else but it. For Apoc. 20. 6. Inde beatus, vnde bonus. Aug. epist* ^2^.

Euery holy man is an happy man, euery godly man is in a blessed estate, be he rich or poore, be he in wealth or in want,

So that of true Godlines, we may well say, as he sometime of diuine knowledge, the ground of it, it is not earthly gaine, nor worldly wealth, nor gold, nor siluer, nor corruptible treasures, but Die t^ista nescire, sed nosse quomodo etiam sine istis hom^ possit esse beatus. Aug opist. 56. it is that that that can make a man happy without all these. And the Godly man, though he haue not these or the like, yet hath he that that can make him truly happy without them, and so consequently that can giue him contentment in the want of them. And certainely if God be (...) Genes. 17. 1. El-shaddai, All-sufficient; then (...) 2. Cor. 12. 9. Gods grace and Godlinesse that bringeth a man home vnto God, and giueth him interest in God, can not but be likewise of it selfe sufficient to make a man truly happy, and to procure vnto him true Contentment.
But will we see yet more particularly by what meanes Godlinesse worketh this Contentment in those that are truly* possessed of it?
First, Act. 15. 9. and 26. 18. it purgeth the heart of him that hath it:e (...) Socrates, ex Aristonymi ^^marijs Stob. c. 92. Sin^erum est nisi vas, quodcunque infundis, acescit* Horat. epist. 2. lib. 1. and so bringeth with it a sanctified vse of the creature. For vnlesse the vessell be seasoned, it tainteth all that commeth into it; and how can ought taste well then, that commeth out of it? So Hagg. 2. 14* 15. V^se f^^ido, vel oleum, vel vinum facile corrumpitur. Ambr. ep. 3. vnlesse a mans heart be seasoned with grace, it pollu^eth and de^ileth all that a man dealeth with. Tit. 1. 15. Vnto the pure, saith the Apostle, all things are pure, but vnto the impure and the vnbelee^ing all things are impure, because their mindes and consciences are defiled. Since the worldly man then doth but moile and soile and defile himselfe with his wealth, doth but taint and pollute it, and himselfe in the vse of it, no meruaile,

if he finde no comfort or contentment at all in it.
Nothing is pure to them, saith the Apostle, because their heart is impure. Quid relliquiest quin habeat, quae quidem in homine dicuntur bona? Parentes, patriam incolumem, amices, genus, cognatos, diuitias? Atqui haec perinde sunt, v^i illius animus, qui ea possidet. Qui vti scit, ei bona, illi qui non vtitur recte, mala.

As a foule stomacke, stuffed with Choler, turneth all into Choler, euen the finest and daintiest meats soonest of any, by meanes whereof no good nourishment can accrew to the bodie by them, nor it grow to any good plight and health: So a foule heart turneth all into spirituall Choler, a bitter humor and vnsauoury, that impaireth and hindreth the health and welfare of the soule as much, yea much more than that materiall choler doth the health and welfare of the bodie.
Whereas Godlinesse sanctifying and cleansing the heart, and purging out that corruption that before tainted and polluted it, and so made all vncomfortable, because noysome and hurtfull, vnto vs, restoreth vnto vs 1. Cor. 7. 14. 1. Tim. 4 4. a pure and sanctified vse of the creature, and enableth vs to suck spirituall nourishment and wholesome iuyce euen out of temporall blessings; which the soule beginneth now to finde sweet comfort and true contentment in, because it vseth them as it ought.
Secondly, it quieteth the Conscience; which in the wicked, in the worldly man is euer vnquiet; and no true Contentment can be till it be quieted.
Job. 15. 20.The wicked man is continually like a woman in trauaile, saith Eliphaz. Etiamsi poenar^ ad tempus immunes videa^tur and exortes reatus, grauiores t^me^ intra se poenas luunt, and sibirei sun^, qui alijs non videntur, atque in segra^iore^ consci^tiae sententia^, cu^ de alioru^ peccatis iudica^t.

And Esai. 57. 20. the wicked mans soule, as the Prophet compareth it, is as a raging Sea, full of soile and filth, that is neuer at rest, whose waters cast vp mire and dirt. Esai. 48. 22. and 57. 21.

Scelus quis tutum, ^^llus securu^ tulit, P. Syr. Secure they may seeme; but they can neuer be safe. If at some time they seem to haue rest, and to be at ease; it is but as with the Sea, that seemeth still sometime, but indeede neuer standeth still, but is euer rising or falling, ebbing or flowing, incessantly rolling to and fro from shore to shore: It is as with the Sea, Noli huic tranquillitati confidere. m^m^^to temporis m^^^ ^^^^titur; and ^^d^m die vbi luserunt navigia, sorbentur* Sen. epist. 4. that seemeth calme and smooth sometime, but vpon euery breath of ayre or blast of winde, is ready to rise and to rage, yea vpon some sodaine gust sometime swelleth so, that ships are there swallowed vp sodainely, where they lay becalmed but a litle before. Their seeming tranquillitie is but as the health of a feverous person when he is out of his fit, or the lightsomnes of a Lunatick that hath his lucida intervalla, and talketh by times as a man well in his wits.
Now what Contentment can there be in ought, while the minde is thus affected, while the Conscience is vnquieted? (...) Plut. de tranquill. So long as a man is heart-sick, he can haue no joy of ought, finde no rellish in

ought, be it neuer so pleasant and delightfull otherwise, be it neuer so acceptable to him at other times; his wonted companie is then but tedious and troublesome to him, his bed hard and vneasie, his chamber too close, his vsuall fare, yea or fare more dainty than vsuall, is distastfull, he findeth no good taste in ought that he taketh: but (...).

And vndoubtedly, let a man striue to smother it and smooth it ouer all that euer he can, let him straine himselfe to lightsomnes by all meanes that may be, let him want no outward matter of worldly either support or delight, yet so long as he hath his guilty Conscience racking and griping him within; though Sardonius hic ris^^ est: intus interi^ eos mordet conscienti^ vermis cauterijs omnibus acrior.

Plut. de sera vindict. a prisoner or condemned person, that sitteth drinking and swilling, or playing at cards and tables in the laile, while the halter that he is to be hanged withall, hangeth ouer his head.
But on the other side, to a quiet minde, to a good Conscience, any thing is acceptable, yea and comfortable, as to him that is now in health. Let the minde be truly setled, let the Conscience be once quieted; and the same man that before tooke no ioy at all in a large estate, found no rellish at all in great varietie of dainties, walked melancholike to and fro in his gardens of pleasure, had no comfort of friends and acquaintance, or of wife and children, can now finde much sweetnesse in a farre poorer pitance, giue God hearty thanks for an homely repast, walke cheerefully abroad, liue comfortably at home, rejoyce with his wife, be merry with his friends, be comforted in his children. And this quietnes of minde and Conscience can nothing procure but sincere Godlinesse. Which therefore, as it giueth true ease, and worketh sound cure of those

inward gripes and galls, not by benumming of a guilty Conseience, nor 1. Tim. 4. 2. searing it, and making it stupid and senseles, as for a time it is sometime in the wicked; but by remouing the ground of them, Rom. 5. 1, 2, 3. by giuing a man assurance of the remission of his sinne, and of reconcilement vnto God, and so freeth a man from that inward disquiet of minde, that banished and kept out all true comfort and contentment before; so it bringeth with it a sweet and comfortable vse of all Gods good creatures; which a man now enioyeth Psal. 41. 11. as fruits of Gods loue, as effects of Gods fauour, and Non tam don^ quam abs te datu^: non tam munere, quam abs te missum. Id ^^re triumphat ser^o. Terent. Eunuch. in that regard more delightful than the things themselues in themselues are, as a present sent a man from his Prince.
Thirdly, it bringeth with it assurance of a greater benefit than all the world is able to counteruaile; to wit, of Gods fauour, and of his fatherly loue toward a man in Christ.
It is the most heauy and the most vncomfortable thing that can be for a man to be forth of Gods fauour. Prov. 19 12. and 20. 2. The wrath of a King, saith Salomon, is as the roaring of a Lion; Prov. 16. 14. as the messengers of the Death. And what is the wrath of him then, Psal. 18. 7. and 104. 32. whose angry looke alone is able to shake heauen and earth? And if Ester. 7. 6, 7. Haman had litle ioy of all his wealth and his treasures, when Assuerus frowned on him, when he was fall'n forth of his fauour; no maruaile if a man haue no ioy of ought, finde no comfort or contentment in ought, so long as God frowneth on him, so long as he is displeased with him, while the blacke clouds of Gods heauy Ioh. 3. 18, 36. wrath hang ouer his head?
And on the other side, by Contrarlorum eadem est ratio. the law of Contraries, as Gods wrath is most hideous, so his loue and fauour is most gracious. As there is nothing more discomfortable than the one; so there is nothing more comfortable than the other. Psal. 30. 5. In thy fauour, saith Dauid, there is life. Yea, Psal 63 3. Thy louing kindnesse, it is better than life. Matth. 6. 25. The bodie is better than rayment, and life of more worth than meat that maintaineth life, saith our Sauiour. And, Job. 2. 4. All that a man hath, as the Deuill sometime said, will a man giue for his life. But Gods fauour and the assurance of it is a greater blessing than life it selfe, and much more then greater then any worldly wealth, that is not at all truly desirable, but as an help and prop to this present life: Able therefore alone of it selfe to stay and support a man, to comfort and cheere vp a man, to giue him true contentment, Quid hac Jobi miseria miserius? quid tamen hac infaelicitate felicius? perdiderat oi^a qu^ dederat Deus: sed habuit ip su^ qui oi^a dederat, Deu^. Aug. Data perdiderat, sed non datorem. Idem Psal. 66. Oi^a perdiderat, and ple^u^ erat. Id^m de divers. 12. to make him an happy man, in the want of all worldly wealth, though he haue nothing else but it.

So when a man hath once found the fauour and loue of God in Christ, hath lighted once on it, and got assurance of it, he ceaseth then to be greedy of this worldly trash, that is in regard of it but as drosse or peble stones to Gold and Diamonds, as maste to the best bread-corne, yea rather of far lesse worth and value to that, than either of these are to it.
To which purpose Dauid saith, that whereas the worldly mans song is, Psal. 4. 6. who will shew vs any good, who will tell vs of any matter of profit? his wish or request rather was, (with other the Godly) Lord lift thou the light of thy face, or thy fauour, on vs. For that Psal. 4. 7. he had found more true ioy and contentment in the assurance of Gods loue, in the view of his louing countenance towards him, then they had or could reape comfort by their worldly commodities, their corne and their wine, wherein their wealth chiefly consisted, though they came in neuer so plentifully vpon them. Psal. 4. 8. and 27. 1. and 3. 5. There was sound rest and assurance of safetie by the one, no securitie in, or surety at all of the other.
Lastly; In that Socrates ab ^rchelao ad facultates ampli^res accersitus, (...), inquit, (...) Arrian^ in protrept. apud Stob. c. 95. it fitteth a mans minde to his meanes, while it assureth him both for the time present, that that estate, whatsoeuer it be, that he is then in, is the best and fittest for him; and for the time to come, that God will continually prouide for him, and neuer see or suffer him to want ought that he shall stand in neede of.
Heb. 13. 5. 6.Let your conversation, saith the Apostle, be without couetousnes; and be Content with what you haue. For God hath promised that Gen. 28. 15. Iosh. 1. 5. he will neuer leaue nor forsake you. So that you may boldly say, as the Psalmist,

Psal. 27. 1. The Lord is my protector, I neede feare nothing; so, Psal. 23. 1. The Lord is my Shepherd, I am sure to lacke nothing. For Math. 6. 33. who so seeketh Gods Kingdome and the righteousnes thereof, shall be sure to haue all other things cast vpon him, that may be for his good, he shall haue the one as an ouer-plus in to the other.
It is a great stay of minde to a man for himselfe or his sonne, if the King shall say to him, as Dauid 2. Sam. 9. 7. to Mephibosheth, or 2. Sam. 19. 38. to Barzillai the Gileadite, I will see that thou, or he shall neuer want, or, you shall neither of you euer want, if I may helpe it: What a stay of minde must it needs be to the Godly man then, when the King of heauen and earth shall say as much vnto him, Psal. 146. 3, 4, 5, 6. he that is able to make his word good at will, and Hebr. 7. 25. liueth for euer to performe whatsoeuer he hath promised?
Againe, the Godly may say it, and assure himselfe of it, that whatsoeuer estate he is in, that estate for the present God seeth to be best and fittest for him. Quaremulta bonis viris aduersa eveniunt? nihil accidero bono viro mali potest, non miscentur contraria. Sen. de* provid. cap. 2. If he be poore, pouertie is best for him, or else he should not so be: if he be sick, sicknes is best for him then, otherwise God would not suffer him to keepe his sick-bed: if in prison, restraint of liberty is then fittest for him, otherwise the prison should no more be able to hold him, then Act. 5. 23, 19. and 12. 6, 7. it was to hold ^eter, when the dores were fast locked on him, and a guard of souldiers set to keepe him sure. If riches were good for him, he should be sure to haue them: if health were good for him, he should be sure not to want it: if liberty, Psal. 118. 5. God without delay would enlarge him and restore it. Psal. 34. 9, 10. For there shall nothing be wanting to those that feare God: The Lions shall

lacke and suffer hunger; but those that seeke the Lord, shall want nothing that is good. Psal. 84. 11. God their Sunne and Sheild will giue them grace and glory: and no good thing will he, (...) Gen. 17. 1. and 15. 1. who is God all-sufficient, denie vnto them, that walke vprightly before him.
Marke the Apostles argument, that he vseth for the proofe of this point: Rom. 8. 32. Qui misit vn^ge^itum, immisit spiritum, promisit vultum: quid tande^ tibi negaturus est? B^rn. de temp. Nihil vnquam ei negasse credendum est, quem ad vituli hortatur esum. Hieron. ad Damas. de Luc. 15. 31. (...); Chrysost, in Rom. ^^. 15. He that spared not his Sonne, but bestowed him vpon vs, how can he but giue vs all things togither with him. And conceiue we the force of it by this comparison: Suppose a man haue a frend, who hauing but one pretious Iewell of great price, that he maketh speciall reckoning of, is content to part with it, and bestow it on him for the ransoming and redeeming of him out of captiuitie: he is content againe, when he is sicke, to be at any charge with him for Physitian and Physick; and yet when he is in the fit of a burning Feuer, he will not by any meanes suffer him to haue a cup of cold water. May not such a one in this case reason thus with himselfe? Surely, if it were good and safe for me, yea were it not certainly dangerous and preiudiciall vnto me to drinke such cold and raw drinke, this my friend that thinketh nothing too good or to deere for me that may do me good, that is content to be at all this cost and charge with me for Physick, would neuer denie me a cup of cold water that standeth him in nothing. And consequently, if he be wise, he will striue against his owne desire of it, and bend himselfe patiently to endure the want and deniall of it, as done in wisdome by his friend, and out of a tender regard of his good. And in like manner doth the Apostle teach the Godly man to reason: God, that hauing

but 1. Petr. 1. 18, 19. one pretious Iewell, to speake of, Ioh. 3. 16. his owne Sonne and his onely Sonne, was content to bestow him vpon me, to shed his heart-bloud for the sauing1. Ioh. 4. 9. of my soule, if he saw health or wealth to be good for me, he would neuer denie it me, Hagg 2. 9. 1 Chr. 29. 11, 12. being no more than as a crum of bread or a drop of water with him. So that so long as he with *holdeth it, I know well that it is better for me to want it than to haue it; and therefore (...); ^usus apud Arrianu^ dissert l^^ c. 1. (...). l 2. c. ^6. I will endeuor to keep my selfe quiet, and rest content with the want of that, which I want for my good.
This Godlinesse perswadeth euery Christian vnto; and this Godlinesse enabled the same Apostle to do: Philip 4. 11, 12, 13. I haue learned, saith he, Magnus ille est qui fictilibus sic vtitur quemadmodu^ argento* nec ille minor est qui sic arge^to vtitur, quemadmodum fictilibus. infirmi animi est pati non posse divitias Sen. epist. 5. to abound: and I haue learned to be in want. (Taught it a man must be, ere he can attaine to it; and it is a lesson, that is not easily learned.) (...). Georg. Pisid. de va^it. vitae. I haue learned to be hungry; and I haue learned to be full. (The one had neede to be learned as well as the other: and till a man haue learned it, he shall neuer be filled.) I haue learned in whatsoeuer estate I am, therwith to be conte^t. I am able to do all things, yet Ille fortis est, qui non in se, sed in Deo fortis est. Aug. in Psal. 31. Bonus vir sine Deo nemo est. an potest aliquis sapra fortuna^ nisi ab illo adintus exurgere? ille dat consilia magnifica and erecta. In vnoquoque bonorum virorum, qui Deus, ineertum est, rabitat Deus. Animu^ excellentem, moderatu^, oi^a tanquam minor a transeuntem, quicquid timemus optamusque ridentem coelestis potentia agitat. Non potest res tanta sine adminiculo numinis stare. Sen. ep. 41. not of mine owne strength, but through the power of Christ enabling me. And so passe we to the third Point, that at first we propounded, to wit hat true Contentment is an vndoubted argument of Godlines.
A Contented minde argueth a religious heart;

and a discontented minde argueth an irreligious spirit. It is a signe that a man seeth not Gods goodnes, considereth not his owne vnworthinesse, when he is euer murmuring and repining, misliking and finding fault with his owne estate, and enuying those that be aboue him. So that where discontent, ment is lodged in the heart, there is Godlinesse excluded and shut out of dores. And hereby may a man know himselfe to be truly religious, if he haue a minde contented euer with his present estate: not Feras, non culpes, quod vitari no^ potest. P. Syrus. Optimum est pati quod emendare non possis. Sen. epist. 107. ^ leve fi^ patientia, Quicquid corrigere est nefas.

Aug. to rest content with whatsoeuer he doth; whom he knoweth Esai. 39. 8. to do nothing but good, and Ps. 119. 71, 67. to do all things for his good: that which is true piety, and a good note of sinceritie wheresoeuer it is found.
But here euery man will be ready to say, that he may seeme religious, that he is well content with his estate, and thanketh God for it with Iob 1 21.Iob, whatsoeuer it be. Well; if it be so, as Saint Iames saith, Iam. 2. 18. Shew me thy faith by thy works: so let vs Aequanimitas vestra nota sit. Philip. 4. 5. shew our Contentment by the effects, by the fruits of it.
Of a Note or two of Contentment then a word or two, and so an end.
One signe of Contentment then is, the vse of lawfull meanes onely; When a man desireth not, nor endeuoureth to better his estate by indirect and vnwarrantable courses: when a man doth Psal. 37. 1, 8. and 73. 12, 13. not fret to see wicked men rise by bad meanes, nor is sorry that he may not do as they do: much lesse is moued to do wickedly, and to take such courses as he seeth wicked ones thriue withall, while himself and other godly, as himselfe seemeth to obserue, either decay, or else stand at a stay.
Gen. 14. 23.Abraham, when the King of Sodome offred him some part of his spoiles, refused to take so much as a shoe-latchet of him, that the King of Sodome might not say that he had made Abraham rich; that men might not say, that Abraham had bin made rich, not by Gods blessing, but by the Kings meanes; he might thanke the King of Sodome for his wealth. So a Godly man will not gaine, nor desire to gaine so much as a shoe-string or shoe-thred by prophaning Gods Sabbaths with N^hem. 13. 16. the Zidonian Merchants, by fraud or deceit, by oppression and extortion, by biting vsury, the Deuils brokery, or by any other vnlawfull and indirect course; that the Deuill may not say, that, he hath made him rich; as

he said sometime to our Sauiour, Matth. 4. 9. All this will I giue thee, if thou wilt fall downe and worship me. For Illas tibi divitias Diabolus dat, quas per furtum, quas per fraudem acquiris. Operis imperf. apud Chrysost. hom. 5. it is of the Deuils gift all that is gotten by such meanes, that is compassed by such courses: and he hath neither a contented minde, nor a religious heart, that will seeke or take ought at the Diuels hand.
As the Num. 9. 22, 23. Israelites therefore trauailing through the wildernes towards the land of promise, (which, to haue gone the next way, had not bin a iourney of many dayes, yet were they many yeeres about) they were to go as God led them, as they saw the Cloud go before them, and not to take that way that seemed best or most compendious in their owne eyes. So must we Obseruare vias Domini. Ps 18. 22. Hebr. 11. 8. (...). Philo de migr. Abr. Idem and Arrian. disser^. l. 1. c. 20. (...) Pythagor. apud Boeth. de consol. lib. 1. pros. 4 Laudat and Plut. in conviv. and Cit. de sin l 4. and Se^. de vita beata c. 15. (...) Cleanthes, and Epictet. enchir. Duc me, parens celsique dominator poli, Quocunque placuit: nulla parendi mora est: Assum impiger. fac nollo: comitabor gemens; Malusque patiar, quod bono licuit pati. Ducu^t volente^ fata, n^lente^ trahu^t. Se^. ep. 107. obserue Gods wayes in our trading and trafficking, in our walking towards wealth: we must keepe the way that God leadeth vs; go no other way than we can see him going in before vs, follow the line of his law, though it seeme to lead vs in and out, backward and forward, as if we were treading of a maze; and not take those wayes, leauing the guidance of it, that seeme gainer and neerer in our owne eyes, and much more compendious than the other. Though we might compasse wealth with a word or two, with the bowe of a knee only the one way, whereas we must trauaile, and toile and moile much ere we come by it the other way: tho we might attaine to it within a day, or a weeke, the one way, whereas we are like to stay long, many yeeres, it may be, ere we come at it, the other way: yet this way must we keepe, and Math. 4. 10. refuse all the world with our Sauiour, if it be offred vs to intice vs out of it.
Otherwise as the Num. 14. 44, 45.Israelites, when they went out of Gods precincts, they went withall out of Gods protection, and so fell before their foes, into whose hands they fell, forsaking Gods shelter and sauegard. So Qui properat di^es^^re. Pro. 28. 20, 22. (...) Menand. Nam dives qui fieri vult, Et cito vult fieri: sed quae reuerenita legum, Quis metus aut pudor est vnqua^ properantis auari. Iuve^. sat. 11. those that make more haste then good speede to be rich, that balke Gods paths, and step aside out of Gods way, to compasse wealth, shall vndoubtedly come to euill. For Qui volunt ditari. 1. Tim. 6. 9 No^ ait, qui sunt, sed qui fieri volunt. B^rn. de diuers. 36. Qui volunt, no^ qui sunt. cupiditates accusat, no^ facultates. Aug. hom. 13. and de temp. 205. Qui augere opes ambit, vitare peccatu^ negligit, and more aviu^ dum escam terrenarum rerum auide conspicit, quo stra^guletur peccati laqueo non agnoscit. Greg. pastor. lib. 3. cap. 1. @ 21. those that will be rich, saith the Apostle, that set this downe, Vnde habeas, quaerit nemo; sed oportet habere. Iuuenal. sat. 14. rich they will be, howsoeuer they come by it, per fas and nefas, by hooke or crook, as we say, by right or by wrong, they pierce their hearts through with many sorrowes, pester their mindes with many fond and noysome lusts and desires, and plunge themselues into many dangerous snares, that at length drowne their soules in destruction.
Yea the very desire of bettring a mans estate by such meanes, is an euident argument of discontent: when it grieueth a man at the heart, that his conscience will not giue him leaue, or that Gods law will notsuffer him to vse those meanes that he seeth worldly men grow wealthy withall. Malus miles est, qui Imperatorem gemens sequitur. Sen. epist. 107. and de vita beata cap. 15. (...) Arrian. dissert. l. 2. cap. 16. He is out of Gods way, though he seem to be yet in it, though he stride not outwardly out of it, that misliketh it, that liketh any other way better than it, that walketh in it with an euill will. And Malu^ opus non est factu^ nisi ab ijs qui ia^ mali erant. Aug. de civit Dei l. 14. c. 13. as Adam and Eve sinned and were euill euen in desiring to eat, before euer

they tasted of the forbidden fruit: So the very desire of libertie for such courses argueth euidently so far forth a minde irreligious, though the heart neuer consent to put them in practise.
A second Signe of a Contented minde is the vse of such lawfull meanes without Care and Couetise, without distrustfull care, without greedy desire.
It is the saying of some of the Ancients, and it is a true saying, that (...) Alex. paed. l. 2. c. 10. Adulter est in sua^ vxorem amator ardentior. Xystus Pythag in sentent. Iu aliena vxore omnis amor turpis est; in sua nimius. Hieron. ad Iovin. lib. 1. c. 1. Intemperans in co^iugio adulter est vxoris suae. Ambr. de Philosoph. co^tra Platon. Adulterum dicit vxoris eu^ esse, qui in ipso quoque vsu coniugij nullam verecundiae vel honestatis cura^ habet. Aug. contra Iulian. l 2. Libido appetitus est sine iudicio, sine modo, vt si vxorem amem amore meret^icio. Jul. S^al. de subtil. exerc. 317. @ 2. A man may commit adulterie with his owne wife: So a man may commit spirituall fornication with the lawfull meanes, that he vseth and lawfully may vse, if he vse them in vnlawfull manner. For the preuenting and auoyding whereof our Sauiour Christ biddeth vs, Math. 6. 25. Take no care, (or, no thought rather, if you will) what we shall eat or drinke, or wherewith we shall be clad. In which precept, or prohibition rather, he forbiddeth not the vse of lawfull meanes, but the distrustfull affection in the vse of those meanes. Which appeareth both by some of the instances that there he maketh vse of, as that Math. 6. 26. of the fowles, that yet Math. 24. 28. ex Iob 39. 31, 32. Legatur Aug. de oper. Monach. c. 22, 23, 24. labour and flie about for their foode and their liuing, but without couetousnes and care; as also by (...) the word that he there vseth, signifying properly such (...) Eustath. Iliad. d. a carking care, as euen diuideth the minde in twaine, and cutteth the very soule as it were asunder.
For the better and fuller conceiuing hereof, we must know, that there is a twofold Care: there is (...). a studious care, and there is (...). a carking care, which we call commonly a taking of thought: there is cura de opere, and cura de operis successu; a care for our

worke it selfe, and a care for the successe of it, for the issue and euent of it. And it is not the former, but the latter of the two, that is there inhibited.
There is a Care for the worke it selfe, when a man is carefull to do his dutie, and to do well that he doth, and accordingly doth painfully and faithfully endeuor to effect it the best he can. And thus there is no man more carefull than the childe of God, than the Christian man; because Ephes. 6. 6. he doth of Conscience all he doth. There is another Care about the issue and successe of the worke, which our Sauiour Christ calleth els-where, (...) Luk. 12. 29. an hanging in suspence, and doubt for the euent of it, as the meteors do in the ayre, vncertaine whither to stay there, or to fall downe to the ground. This is then, when a man is not content to do his best endeuor, but he casteth doubts, and taketh thought for what the issue of it will be; he fore thinketh with himselfe, that if he gaine not by such a bargaine, he shall be vndone; if such a debtor breake or keep not touch with him, he shall be vtterly ouerthrowne; if his grounds take not, or his cattle stand not, he shall not haue bread to put in his belly; if he can not get the fauour of such a Iudge, or such a great man, he shall neuer haue any good successe in his Law suites, or, if he be toward the Law, his Counsell will grow out of request. etc.
Conceiue it yet further by these two Examples. Mark. 13. 11. Our Sauiour forbiddeth his Apostles both (...) to take care, and (...) to take thought before hand, when they are to appeare before great persons; both to fore-cast with themselues what to speake when they

come before them, and to fore-thinke how that they shall speake will be taken when they haue spoken it. Yet the Ministers of the word now a daies are (...) vnde meditari. Lat. to studie before hand what to speake either in Church or Court, if they be there to appeare, because they haue it not now ordinarily by immediate instinct at an instant, as Math. 10 9. they then had: But they are not (...) to take thought how their speeches will speede, but leaue the issue of it to Gods good will.
Againe, Math. 28 13, 14. the Priests bid the Souldiers say, that CHRISTS corps was stolne away by night while they slept, and promise withall (...) to secure them, or so to saue them harmlesse, that they shall not neede to take further care in that kinde. The Souldiers were yet to plot and deuise how to tell their Tale so, as it might carry most shew of truth with it, and hauing so done, they were to relie on the Preists credit for the rest, who had giuen them their word before for the issue of it, that it should no way proue prejudiciall or jeapordous to them. In like manner it is our part to take care how to performe those offices and duties that God hath called vs vnto in the best manner that we may: but for the successe of it, when we haue performed our part, and done our dutie and our endeuor, we must, as the Apostle willeth vs, (...). Philip. 4. 6. be wholy secure or carelesse; take no thought for ought, but leaue all to God, and relie wholy vpon him, who hath commanded vs 1 Pet. 5. 7 to cast (...) all our care in this kinde vpon him, and promised withall that he will take this care for vs.
This distrustfull care breedeth that 1. Tim. 6. 10. (...) Bio^ apud Stob. c. 10. (...) Clem. Alex padag. l. 2. c. 3. Auiditas materia malorum omnium Amm^an. hist. lib. 31. parens. Latus Mauritio. Sicut radi^ bonoru^ omnium est charitas, ita malorum omnium cupiditas. Aug. hom. 8. Couetousnes that is the Roote of all euill. Not amisse termed the

Roote, as some well haue obserued: because as there is life oft in the roote, when there is no sap in the branches: so this vice oft liueth, when other die and decay. For Libidinis ignis paulatim extinguitur, and cum senecture consenescit: at avaritia augescit continuo, and cum senectute iuvenescit, quando vitia reliqua consen^scu^t. Rolloc. ad 1. Tim. 6. euen old men, Auaritia senilis quid sibi velit non intelligo. potest eni^ quicquam esse absurdius, quam quo minus restat viae, eo plus quaerere viatici? Cic. de senect. Mirabilis sane dementia (...) vnim samptibus se o^^rare fastinat, cu^ iam par(...)quo tendebat, Aug. de temp. 246. against reason, that haue least time to liue, are oft-times most carefull for, most couetous of the things of this life: they thinke, though they haue neuer so much, that vnlesse they gather still more, they shall want or starue yet ere they die; they shall not haue meate, saith one, to put in their mouths while they liue, nor money to burie them with when they be dead.
But neither will such Philip. 4. 5, 6. Carefulnes, or such Hebr. 13. 5. Couetousnes stand with Contentment: and therefore must be both far from vs, if we would be accounted truly religious. We must banish all such distrustfull thoughts, we must abandon all such greedy desires. We must learne, as Matth. 6. 12. we pray but for daily bread; so to rest content with it when we haue it; yea to rest content too, when we haue it not, with the want of it. We must learne, when we haue done our best endeuor, to leaue the issue and euent of our labors to God. As Ioab saith to his souldiers; 2. Sam 10. 12. Letd (...) Plut. de ov^r. vs be of good courage, and fight valiantly for our King and our Country; and let the Lord then do what seemeth good in his sight. So must we do what God hath enjoyned vs to do; and when we haue so done, Psal. 37. 5. commit our way for the issue of it to him, and relie vpon him, and he will bring it about; he will be sure then to giue such issue to it as shall be for our good.
The third and last Note of Contentment may be Psal. 13. 7. Silence before the Sheerer. When God commeth

to sheere a man of his substance, of his wealth and his riches, if he haue a contented minde, he will not murmur and repine at it, as Psal. 106. 25. the Israelites euer and anon when they wanted Exod. 17. 3. water, or Exod. 16. 2, 3. bread, or Num. 11. 4, 5, 6, 7. flesh in the wildernes: but rather praise God with Iob; Iob 1 21. Abstulit, sed and dedit. Sen. epist. 64. (...) Arria^. dissert. l. 1. c. 11. Tulisti liberos quos ipse dederas. non contristor, quod recepisti, ago gratias quod dedisti. Hiero^ ad Iulian. God gaue it, and God taketh it: blessed be Gods name. Vitam reposcen^^ naturae, tanquam debitor bonae fidei, red^^turus exulto. Iulian. apud Ammian. l. 25. I returne my life to Nature requiring it back, said that Apostata, as some report of him, when he lay a dying, as a faithfull debtor, with a good will. So (...) Epictet. Enchir. Vita data est v^enda, data est sine ^oenore nobis Mutua, nec certe persoluenda die. Pedo ad Liv. Non est quod nos suspiciamus, tanquam inter nostra positi. mutuo accepimus: (non tam data, quam commodata. Primas. ad 1. Cor.) vsus fructus noster est: cuius tempora ille arbiter muneris sui temperat. nos oportet in promptu habere, quae in incertum diem data sunt, and appellatos sine querela reddere. Sen. ad Marc. cap. 10. should we returne God his owne againe, that he hath pleased to lend vs, as faithfull and thankfull debtors with hearty good will; Non moeremus quod talem amisimus; sed gratias agimus, quod habuimus. Hieron. epitaph. Pa^^ae. rendring thanks vnto him, that we haue had them so long, not repining because we can haue them no longer.
But we contrariwise, when we haue had a long time the vse of Gods blessings, are wont to lay claime to them, and to account them as our owne by prescription; and so, P^ssimi est debitoris creditori facere convitium. Sen. ibid. as it falleth our ofttimes by bad borrowers and worse pay-masters, God looseth a frend with vs for asking his owne of vs.
Psal. 39. 9.I was dumbe, saith David, and opened not my mouth, because it was thy doing. It is a signe that a man seeth Gods hand on him for his good, if he can be silent when God straitneth and impaireth his estate.
And Hebr. 10. 34. the faithfull Hebrewes, saith the Apostle,

with ioy, not quietly onely but cheerefully, sustained the losse of their worldly goods, knowing that they had better treasure and more durable laid vp for them in heauen. It is a signe that Hebr. 11. 25, 26. a man looketh at a better matter, when he can so readily and so cheerefully part with his wealth: as Gen. 45. 20. Iacob regarded not his houshold-stuffe and substance in Canaan, when he had all the fat of Aegypt before him.
Shut we vp this last point with this familiar similitude. A garment that hangeth loose about a man is put off with ease; but so is not the skin that sticketh fast to the flesh, nor the shirt that cleaueth fast to the vlcerous leper; a tooth if it be loose, it commeth out with ease, but if it sticke fast in the head, it is not pulled out but with paine, yea many times it bringeth away some peece of the gumme or the jaw with it. So here, Tunc vere oftendimus, quia accepta recte tenuimus, quu^ aequa^imiter ad momentum sublata toleramus Greg. mor. l. 2. c. 42. Mihi diuitiae si effluxerint, nihil ^uferent nisi semetipsas: tustup^bis and videboris tibi sine terelictus, si illa a te recesseri^t. apud me diuitia aliquim locu^ habent; apud t^ summum: ad postremum divitiae ^easunt, tu diuiti^rum es. Senec. de vita beat. c. 12. a man is content willingly to part with his riches, when Psal. 62. 10. Sapiens divitias non amat, sed mavult: non in animu^ illas, sed in domum recipit. Senec. ibid. 21. Omnia istae nobis accedant, non hareant: vt si abduca^tur, sine vlla nostri laceratione discedant. Idem epist. 74. his heart is not set vpon his wealth: but (...). Basil. ad divit. hom. 7. (...). Hesiod. (...). Antiphanes. (...). Antipho apud Stob. cap. 10. Vip^te quibus pecu^ia sua ^bhasit, nec sine sensu avelli potest. Sen. de tranquill. c. 8. if his heart be glewed to it, it euen renteth his heart in two to part with it, it pulleth as it were a peece of his soule away with it. And that is the reason why Iob. 1. 21. Iob blessed God, when he took away all that euer he had from him, whereas most men, if God take from them but a small pitance of that they haue, are ready, as Iob. 1. 11. the Diuell

vntruly said that Iob would do, euen to curse him to his face.
To conclude then: Would we be esteemed truly Religious? Philip 4. 5. Let our contentment of minde nota sit omnibus. appeare to the world; in not seeking of these outward things, either by indirect courses, or with distrustfull desire; in patient enduring the want of them, when God seeth good to denie them, and in quiet parting againe with them, when God shall call againe for them: Assuring our selues that God doth all for our good, as well in with-holding or with-drawing of them from vs, as in conferring them vpon vs, or in continuing them vnto vs: So shall we be sure of a comfortable vse of Gods good blessings in this life, and of certaine enjoyment of eternall blessednes togither with God himselfe in the next life.
FINIS.
