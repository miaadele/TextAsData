heaven place or be it your beauty do enforce this grace be heaven descend to the low earth or be it your music that do cause this mirth or be it a dream and do I nothing see that sweet thus my fantasy or if none of these what it then shall be I pray thou gentle lady tell to i pause a while and look in my face thus she bespeak i with a modest grace vain to boast of my descent or blood will argue I do fear my proper good for who his blood only and kin commend commend nought of his own but of his friend yet be I so dispose my birth to prove I can derive myself from high jove and I can say and yet but true say my mother be the wise mnemosyne or I can call my name Calliope and tell how once I with Apollo lie from who mix pleasure be then but young the thracian Orpheus natural spring but farewell this my purpose be to show from whence my come hither now do flow virtue confine in a narrow room far in the north where she do only bloom where have she not content favour see from all the world she have exile be and long ere this have lose her glorious name have she not there revive her die fame o worthy place thy epithet henceforth be sing by poet thus the virtuous north. now break forth into a large state which of all land be make most fortunate give i the matter of this new delight and do my soul unto this joy excite that hour unnumbered have be lock from light and puzzle lie in dark oblivious night gross nature that have many year lie sick first wound with lewd vice sting prick on the corrupt bed of vain desire without all show of hope ever to aspire to bless fruition of herself be now the thought whereof will smooth the agedst brow clean purge of her filth from error lead as till this hour she be not perfect breed but age infinite have lie in earth and by no mean before can have her birth even as a hawk new take from the mew have cast her old train and resume a new so nature now do with fresh wing aspire who old one all be taint over with mire time that before be bait with in the foul river of a force sweat to make simplicity the soon bite that have no eye but bend on delight who will not live in blind credulity rather than see what he will fear to see be now full gorge with honourable zeal which late proof do to the world reveal now yet at last return be those day that ancient poet long ago do praise which have so many year be keep from breath bar up within the iron cave of death which eat time consent with the fate have now enlarge by burst open the gate for joy whereof can but this dumb earth speak she will into a exultation break yet for she want a tongue to show her pleasure she be invest with her rich treasure erect thy face and thou shall see on high the star do dance proud galliarde in the sky or else they all be force thus to move under the

altogether quench black vile betray policy be dead and meager envy hang down her head and wheresoever a vice have reign long in that same place there be a virtue spring now shall those young and virtuous plant arise which be destroy by loathsome poisonous eye here poet may extol their excellence if barbarism have not exile they hence if other land enjoy not their bless sight who bark ignorance have put to flight their long-sheathed pen they may so exercise as they shall sit above the reach of eye and look down upon their native earth shall grieve to think they have so low a birth yet I have one thing leave surmount the rest which tune such music in my gladsome breast that sorrow can my least thought annoy each room in i be so fill up with joy nor can I tell it with my breath faint story I be so swell up with immortal glory can sense say I more of delight yet taste then that which have thy lip already past thou tell wonder and I fear this night my greedy ear will surfeit on delight yet if unspoken joy do live in thou of it in kindness let i sharer be wherewith to i she do her white hand reach and sweet thus continue on her speech in Boeotia my sister eight and I which once say she be elevate high and well esteem in former age pass until these dead corrupt time come last and every year to we have tribute pay by choice wit for lend they our aid have long in stead of tribute be disgrace and all our name from memory displace for want whereof we all be grow so poor that we can scarce keep misery from our door the chief pay we have to set we forth in all our want come from the princely north and some from hence from worthy Delia store from sweet idea and from some few more all which so short of that we have before to those rich time so slender and so poor that with it we ourselves can scarce sustain our number be so great so small our gain other here be which with their rail muse offend grave ear and do our name abuse in bring forth such monster to the light who ugly shape do terrify our sight but why shall such my peaceful gall excite well they may bark but they shall never bite the whip be make shall yerk they from their place who room shall be adorn with better grace but now oever bless eternal sweet the laurel and a triple crown do meet now come in our long-detained spring reduce back by a victorious king who triple crown to add more glorious praise be triple crown with a triple bay which be the rich crown a king can have it keep he from oblivion of the grave where after some expense of run time upon who back do dissolution clime his other crown that guild but the eye will quick fade when fade majesty but this so long as heaven lend a breath shall fresh spring in spite of fate and death to be a prince it be a honour thing yet every poet to himself be a King but where in one they both commix be he than be equal with a deity this cause we all to leave our Helicon our double-topped hill our Cithaeron that be nigh ruinate with disgrace and hither come to a more worthy place where on the top of a imperious throne we will build up another Helicon the hill we leave be all compose of mould but we will here erect a hill of gold which where it stand shall to such height arise as it shall keep the star from mortal eye and by these name it shall be call above the muse tent the golden walk of jove from all my sister have I steal away which marvel much of my so long a stay to bring these glorious tiding unto thou the which have infinite ravish i that if thou covet to have thy name never die but wrap thy memory in eternity past deprivation of corrupt dust when thou into thy late bed be thrust this place can yield thou such promethean fire as shall give answer to thy bless desire therefore no long hide thy muse from light but pray thou pray thou take thy pen and write nor think I will thus much to thou impart but that I know thou do affect this Art alas say I shall I deny my love of ignorance you may i then reprove yet hapless I nothing in i have place more than my love with which I can it grace or if there be I shall not trace this way for that I grieve see how every day new swarm of vertue-killing drone appear which vile so untune the general ear with harsh discord sound as who now sing although his line be sweet than the string that play the morning up get no respect and be not hear or hear but with neglect but soon far may move the stone to hear then careless man who only body bear without true soul for have they soul they will with all their nerve the life of soul uphold in give nutriment to art from whence man whole do derive his excellence these be the Hydra of this age the ape the monster roll up in man please shape have so infect with their taint blood the nourish fruit which shall feed the good that undeserving they now must stand under the censure of too rough a hand and for whole year of night in labour spend to give the envious idle world content must not for all those night receive more right than he who sleepy muse never see the night which make they choose to be with ease infect rather than write and have their work neglect where may not every cuckoo have access and bring vnsau'rie writing to the press to dull the ear of man already slay with poisonous swell of their rot brain what throng of learned soul will then aspire touch with this sacred and celestial fire how many will by this their heavenly skill have ability as great as will infinite upraise themselves from earth make their being far high than their birth but now they hide lie from light exempt rake up within the ash of contempt this make i that be with skill unblessed to love this art but dare not rank the best with childish issue of my faint muse as poor ambitious do use beside what slender glory can ensue his muse whereof the world take never view fie fie say she thou be too critical and do consent unto thy own dread fall admit thy worth be under the degree of toleration which I know not to be suppose that million do deserve more praise will thou for this forsake Apollo bay o do not so thy muse may once be bless and gentle fost'r in a kingly breast what though the world see never line of thou never can thy muse have a birth more divine and where these ugly imitate ape which as thou say do but usurp man shape have so defile this land the time be now come those bawl fool shall quite be strike dumb or shall they talk what can it hurt the wise it be well know they but idolatrize for when true judgement shall their error find it will add more honour to the virtuous mind sweet Philomela that sing in the spring will lose some grace do not the cuckoo sing therefore no long hide thy muse from light but pray thou pray thou take thy pen and write with these enforcement be I win at length convince whole by her powerful strength and new inspire with a sacred light agree to write what I have see to night and if this prosper but successefullie I will herein my further fortune
