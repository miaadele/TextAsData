the chief man of the nation of the cover their privity that although the better sort of man especial the Yaios do cover their privity by wear over they a little piece of Cotton cloth pretty weave after their manner yet do I never see any of their woman cover in any part the woman general go all naked either above or beneath the waste albeit they daily converse among we but be all as the plain proverb be even stark belly naked at their come aboard my ship first Carasana as the principal among they and after he the rest salute and welcome we after their rude manner I use they with all courtesy and entertain they as well as the straight room will give i leave give they good store of aquavitae which they love exceed I present to their view their two countryman Martin the lord of

be the same person who they suppose have be long since dead they express much joy and contentment and understand from their own mouth how well I have use they they seem to be better please with our come and when their rude salutation to their new come countryman be end I take they apart and thus declare the cause of my come first their conference with the indian I bring to their remembrance the exploit perform by Sr. Walter Raleigh in their country in the reign of our late sovereign queen Elizabeth when to free they from servitude he most worthy vanquish the spaniard at Trinidado burn their town take their governor don Anthonio de Berreo prisoner deliver five of the indian king imprison and bind by the neck with collar of iron and with great labour and peril discover the river of Orenoque and the country adjoin as far as the province of Aromaya the country of Topiawary and the river of Caroly beyond it and that their countryman call the the render themselves subject to queen Elizabeth who be the borderer of the Orenoque do then most willing submit and render themselves under the subjection of the late queen all which they well remember and say that Sr. Walter Raleigh promise to have return again unto they long since then I excuse his not return according to his promise by reason of other employment of great importance impose upon he by the late queen show they moreover that when he can not for that cause return himself he send captain Keymis to visit they and to bring he true intelligence of their estate suppose that he have leave no spaniard behind he at Trinidado of power to molest they to the end that relief and aid may be prepare for they according to their necessity and oppression of their enemy then I tell they of the death of the late queen whereby that business of they be again hinder moreover I declare unto they that our gracious sovereign lord king JAMES who now reign over u3 be the only right and lawful heir and successor to the crown and dignity of the realm of England after the death of the late queen be throughout the whole land proclaim king of England and so come to reign over we have be ever since busy in order the state and affair of the kingdom which be by his great wisdom settle in tranquillity and peace like a good gracious and worthy king do now permit his subject to travel abroad into foreign country and nation to aid and assist all such as be unjust molest by their enemy whereupon I and the rest of these worthy gentleman my associate and friend possession of the country take at Wiapoco by captain Lee to his meiestics use have intelligence by some that have be follower of captain Charles Lee who be a man well know among they and heretofore have take possession of their country to his majesty use and be plant diverse year in Wiapoco where he lie bury of the great variance and discord depend between they the ally nation the Yaios Arwaccas Sappaios and Parago^tos and their enemy the Carib all inhabit between the river of amazon and Dessequebe have make a long and dangerous voyage into those part to appease their dissension and defend they against the Carib or other enemy that shall molest or oppress they and now be there arrive do intend to make search in those country for convenient place where such of our nation as shall hereafter come to defend they may be fit seat to dwell among they that if any of those nation shall attempt at any time to disturb the quiet live of their neighbour they may have store of english friend at hand and among they that will not spare their pain to appease their discord nor their life to defend they from harm when I have thus declare unto they the cause of my come they make this answer that with our come they be well please but our number of man they think too great that they want mean to provide we bread sufficient for they all have but a small town few garden and slender provision for their own company because since captain Lee his death and his man departure from they they never make provision for any stranger I reply that albeit their town be small and their garden few for the ground wherein they plant their Cassavi whereof they make their bread they call their garden yet their country be full of inhabitant and have store of garden to supply our want of bread and be plentiful store with other provision sufficient for a great number which I desire may be weekly bring unto we as need require for that I mean not to take it without recompense but will give they for it such commodity as shall well please they which they want as axe hatchet knife bead looking-glass jew trump and such like thing wherein they most delight then they desire to consult among themselves the indian go to council which I permit and expect their answer above two hour which time they spend in debate the matter after their manner and drink aquavitae and in the end desire my presence and make i this answer that they be content and well please we shall live among they their answer that they will furnish we with house to lodge in and provide all necessary for we in the best manner they can but whereas I say our king will permit his people to live and abide among they and defend they against their enemy they answer it be a thing they great desire and have expect long and now they make much doubt thereof and say they be but word have heretofore be * * by Sr. walt. Raleigh and Capt. lee. promise the like but nothing perform to resolve that doubt and make good my speech I tell they that what I have speak shall certain be perform and to that end will leave my brother in their country and some of my company with he to dwell among they until a great supply may be send from England for their better defence then they seem to give credit to my word and so after much talk and many compliment to please the naked people I give to Carasana a sword and to the rest some other thing which please they well and then after their manner take their leave they depart the next day the indian Martin go ashore the indian Martin go ashore and seem joyful that he have again recover his own home the day follow I take land with my company in arm and colour display and go up unto the town the english take land where I find all the woman and child stand at their door to behold we the principal indian come out unto i and invite i into the captain house which until the return of Martin belong unto his brother the english feast by the indian as chief lord in his absence I go up with they and be friendly feast with many kind of their country cates when I have well eat

after another and after their manner bid i welcome I give they many thanks and some reward for their kind entertainment and then dispose my company in convenient lodging but yet I keep a continual guard as in time of war when I have thus settle my company at this village the english settle at Caripo in Wiapoco I go out to view the situation of the place the strength of the place and the advantage for defence thereof it be a great rocky mountain not accessable by reason of fast wood and steep rock but only in certain place which be narrow foote-path very steep and easy to be defend whereby we be lodge as in a fort and most convenient in respect the harbour be so near for our ship do ride at anchor underneath we over against the foot of the hill be thus arrive upon the coast I find the time of the year so unseasonable for our purpose that by reason of continual reins we be constrain to lie still and do nothing for the space of three week or a month in which idle time I confer with the indian so metime with one sometime with another and by help of my indian Anthony canahre and the indian John above mention who I use for my interpreter I gather from they as well as I

have many wife or more the rest but one account he that have most wife the great man their wife especial the elder sort be as servant unto they for they make their bread and drink dress their meat serve they at meal and do all the other business about the house these province be people with diverse nation of several language diverse language in Guiana namely Yaios Arwaccas Sappaios Paragotos and Carib the Carib most ancient upon the sea coast the Carib be the ancient inhabitant and the other nation be such as have be chase away from Trinidado and the border of Orenoque and forasmuch as they have unite themselves in those part the Carib have hold they in continual war but the Yaios and the other nation their ally be grow so strong that they have constrain the Carib of the sea cost to contract a peace with they yet bear no hearty love the one nation to the other but with the Carib inhabit the inland part upon the mountain they have as yet no peace at all for they do often time come down upon they in great number the indian make war for their woman spoil and burn their house kill their man and carry away their woman which be the great cause of war and hatred among they whereof our man have see experience in Cooshebery where happen a accident worth the observe which I will here declare unto your highness the indian Leonard Ragapo before mention be a Yaio who find the country of Cooshebery slender inhabit have seize upon it for his own and at his earnest request I send four gentleman of my company to remain there with he the natural inhabitant that dwell upon the uttermost bound thereof towards the south and west be Carib and enemy to he and to his nation for while our man unknown to the Carib stay at Cooshebery the Carib war upon Leonard they assemble themselves together to the number of 200. or more and come down into his signiory burn and spoil house roast one woman take many prisoner and intend to assault he also which to prevent he arm about 50. of his indian the usual weapon of the indian with their usual weapon which be bow and arrow long staff sharpen at the point and with fire harden wooden sword and target very artificial make of wood Leonard desire and of the English and paint with beast and bird he request also our man to aid and assist he with their musket which I command they to do upon all such occasion offer and so be all in readiness Leonard as their captain lead they on to intercept his enemy and as I have hear by Mr. Henry Baldwin who then be present and to observe the manner of their war give he leave to command all he brave perform that exploit in good order after their manner and with great judgement and resolution for in the front he first place our four englishman the manner of order their man in the war by two in a rank next to they two indian arm with wooden sword and target then two archer and after they two man with sharpen staff instead of pike and in like manner order and rank all his company be thus prepare he march against the charib who near at hand be come in the same order towards he but when they approach and unexpected perceive our english man among the Yaios they be much amaze and make a sudden stand the Carib amaze at the sight of the English which Leonard perceive guess right at the cause and instant do make good use of that advantage he command his own company to keep their station himself with a sword in his hand which I have give he and a target of his own fashion go bold towards they to parley with their captain and have call they out Leonard speak to the Carib he reprove they for come as enemy into his signiory for burn and spoil his house and his people he demand satisfaction for the hurt do and restitution of the prisoner take and warn they forthwith to depart out of his signiory and desist from war which if they refuse to fulfil he be there ready with his friend the englishman to fight with they and revenge his wrong and say further that if in the conflict any of the english man be slay or hurt he will then fetch all the rest from Wiapoco and return to burn their house and cut they all in piece thus he bold speak with such a courage show also our man unto they the Carib agree to peace for fear of the English who have their match in cock ready to discharge that he strike such a fear into they all by reason of our man presence that they present agree to peace perform what condition he require and then depart home with all their company here may your highness note the faction among the indian nation the discipline and order they hold in war the fear the Carib conceive at the sight of our englishman and the policy of the indian Leonard to take advantage by their fear and make our man his guard and chief protection against they these thing in time will much avail we be well observe and right apply according to occasion but to our former discourse the power and strength of these country be so thin people be not very great to withstand the might of foreign enemy the usual weapon of the indian be before describe save that their arrow be ofttimes poison but since our trade and commerce with they they have get a few good sword musket caliver and some small quantity of shot and powder and have learned to handle their piece very orderly and some of they be good shot the season of the year upon this coast the season of the year in Guiana and in this climate be diverse for in the east part of Guiana towards the amazon the dry weather which we call their summer the summer begin in August begin in August and the violent reins and tempestuous wind which we count their winter do begin in February but in the western part the winter begin in February towards Orenoque the dry season begin in October and the reins and wind in April there be little difference of heat and cold in this diversity of season be so near the equinoctial where the day and night be always equal the sun ever rise and set at six of the clock or near thereabouts which climate by the ancient philosopher in respect of the nearness of the sun which cause excessive drought and heat be account the unhabitable and burn zone the burn zone but our daily experience do assure we of their certain mistake in that point for in those part we find that when the sun decline further from they towards the tropic of Capricorn the air be then clear and the season of the year most dry as in the eastern part of Guiana in August September October November and December and when the sun return towards the tropic of cancer then do the reins begin increase and decrease from February to july but sometime they begin to fall and the river to rise swell and overflow soon or late by a month and the year be sometime more or less windy and wet according to the disposition of the heaven and of the planet and as the sun approach or decline little or much even so the earth want or abound with water and moisture the reason of these strange diversity from other region without the tropic be very excellent declare by joseph acosta in the second book of his natural and moral history of the indies joseph acosta to which author I refer you for your better satisfaction therein but withal I must advertise you that when you read his first and second book you have regard to the place where they be write which be in Peru repute by we to be beyond the equinoctial towards the south or Pole antarctic lest you err by mistake his meaning for in those two book when he mention any place beyond the equinoctial he mean towards the north or pole Arctic and also you must note that this general rule for the heaven temprature be only limit to the region of the burn zone within the tropic they have no division or account of time or number their account of time and number they only reckon by the moon as one two three four or five moon or by day in like manner their number they reckon thus one two three and so to ten then they say ten and one

we altogether want the true skill and knowledge how to order it which now of late we happy have learn of the spaniard themselves whereby I dare presume to say and hope to prove within few month as other also of sound judgement and great experience do hold opinion that only this commodity tobacco so much seek after and desire will bring as great a benefit and profit to the undertaker as ever the

thing they have or that their country yield and will perform any reasonable labour for they thus have I deliver unto your highness the particular of the several commodity which hitherto we have discover and find likely to be profitable in Guiana whereof example be remain to be see in the hand of Mr. Henry Houenaer a Dutchman who in the year of our lord 1610. perform a voyage to Guiana to the place where our company be seat and now abide in thames-street near unto Cole-harbour and I make no doubt that by continuance of time our painful travel and diligent observation we shall discover and get knowledge of a infinite number of other as rich necessary and beneficial as these already speak of or any other whatsoever if it please almighty God to favour and bless our proceed when the rain cease which be in july I begin to travaell abroad in search of those golden mountain promise unto we before the begin of our voyage by one that undertake to guide we to they which fill my company so full of vain expectation and golden hope that their insatiable and covetous mind be whole set thereon can not be satisfy with any thing but oenly Gold our guide that vain make those great promise be come unto the wish place to make performance be then possess with a shameless spirit of ignorance for he know little and can perform nothing what other intelligence of mine already fowd I have from other man in England and from the Mr. of my ship who have be heretofore in those part I find they by experience false and nothing true concern mine that be in England report unto i our greedy desire of gold be thus make frustrate diverse unconstant person of my unruly company begin to murmur disorder by mutiny to be discontent to kindle discord and discension and to stir up mutiny even almost to the confusion and ruin of we all and be upon the point to shake off all obedience to their commander to abandon patience peace and unity and wilful to break out into all mischief and wretched disorder only because they be deceive of their golden hope and expectation but with good word and comfortable persuasion I pacify they for the time and make they acquaint with my better hope conceive of the commodity above mention I persuade they in general from idleness to travel abroad to search and seek out among the indian what other novelty they can though gold be want whereby we may hereafter benefit ourselves and still I employ they some one way and some another to occupy their mind by do something the better to prevent dissension which common be breed of idleness the slothful mother of all filthy vice as I daily converse among the indian it chance one day that one of they present i with a half moon of mettle which hold somewhat more than a three part gold the rest copper another also give i a little image of the same mettle and of a other I buy a plate of the same which he call a spread eagle for a axe all which thing they assure i be make in the high country of Guiana the high country of Guiana abound with image of Gold which they say do abound with image of gold by they call carrecoory these thing I show to my company to settle their trouble mind which give much contentment to the great part of they and satisfy we all that there be gold in Guiana short after that my indian Anthony Canabre bring i a of a rock of white spar whereof the high country be full and if the white Sparres of this kind the rock of the pure white spar be mine of gold or silver which be the pure white of all other for every sort of i have a spar and for the most part white be in a main rock they be certain mine of gold or silver or of both I make trial of a piece of spar which the same indian discover unto i and I find that it hold both gold and silver which although it be in small quantity give i satisfaction that there be rich mine in the country to be find but the best lie deep in the earth and we have not time nor power to make search for they be thus inform and sufficient resolve of the commodity of the country and well satisfy of the mineral I bend all my endeavour to find out the fit place and most convenient for our first plantation at the last I find out many and some of special note which be for many respect of great importance and when time serve our force and number of man be answerable I will lay they open to the knowledge of the world and for wealth I hope they shall full answer all man expectation I travel up the river of Wiapoco to view the overfall but the water be high and strong I can not pass they in August when they be fall with some labour they may be pass many overfall in Wiapoco this river have very many overfall lie one a good distance beyond another even to the head thereof above some of the first fall there dwell a indian call comarian who be a old man of a free disposition by he I learn that a certain distance above the first fall the river Arwy fall into Wiapoco moreover that certain day journey beyond he towards the high land upon the border of Wiapoco there be a nation of Carib have great ear of a extraordinary bigness people have great ear who worship a idol of stone hard to be believe who he call Marashewaccas among these people as comarian report there be a idol of stone which they worship as their god they have place it in a house make of purpose for the great honour of it which they keep very clean and handsome this idol be fashion like a man sit upon his heel the proportion of the idol hold open his knee and rest his elbow upon they hold up his hand with the palm forward look upward and gape with his mouth wide open the meaning of this proportion he can not declare although he have be many time among they and have often see it what other nation be beyond these he do not know have never travail so far but he say they be Carib and also enemy unto they it seem there be many nation of those great ear people for in the river of Marrawini I hear also of the like who dwell far up towards the high land as hereafter you shall hear and I suppose by the trend of the river of Wiapoco and Marrawini be all one people upon the 14. day of August I go unto a mountain call Gomeribo be the uttermost point of land to the northward in the bay of Wiapoco I find the soil of it most excellent for tobacco Maix Cotton tree Annoto tree vine and for any other thing that shall be plant there when I have take good view of the place and find it commodious for many purpose possession take for the king at Gomeribo then in the presence of capt. Fisher diverse gentleman and other of my company and of the indian also I take possession of the land by turf and twig in the behalf of our sovereign lord king JAMES I take the say possession of a part in name of the whole continent of Guiana lie betwixt the river of amazon and Orenoque not be actual possess and inhabit by any other christian prince or state wherewith the indian seem to be well content and please in like manner my brother capt. Michael Harecourt and capt. Harvey who I leave as his associate and he esteem as a inward friend in a notable journey which to their great honour they perform to discover the river of Arrawary and the country border upon it near adjoin to the river of amazon do take the like possession of the land there the like possession take at Arrawary to his majesty use the danger and great difficulty which they in that attempt encounter be memorable and such as hardly any of our nation in such small canoe be only somewhat long but not so broad as our Thames wherry and flat bottom ever overcome the like first the number of their own attendant beside themselves be only one man and a boy their troop of indian 60. person their journey by sea unto the river of Arrawary be near 100 league wherein by the way they meet with many dreadful plunge by reason of a high go sea which break upon the flat and shoal especial at the next great cape to the north of Arraway which in respect of the danger they pass there they name point perilous point perillus. then their discovery up the river be 50. league more where they find a nation of indian which never have see white man or christian before and can not be draw to any familiar commerce or conversation no not so much as with our indian because they be stranger to they and of another nation the discovery of this river be of great importance and special note afford a entrance more behooveful for the search and discovery of the inland part of Guiana than any other river yet know upon the coast for trend westward up into the land it discover all the country and nation to the southward of arricary Cooshebery Morrownia and norrack which I have mention before many week they spend in this adventure still take up their lodging in the wood at night provision of meat they want not a great argument of plenty in the country for fish be ever plenty and at hand and the wood yield either deer tiger or foul their great want be of bread and drink which only defect do hinder at that time the accomplishment of that discovery for when the indian perceive their bread to be near spend and their drink to be corrupt they can not be persuade to proceed have no mean to supply their want among the arrawary the indian of that river who will not free trade with they upon this first acquaintance but always stand upon their guard on the other side of the river where they inhabit yet they desire to obtain some of our english commodity and make trial of our indian friendship afford some small trade for their present relief during their abode in that river so that of force they be constrain to break off their discovery and hasten homeward but here their danger end not for as they return arrive at certain island call carripoory and pass between they and the main land much against the will of all the indian who know the danger of the place and more respect their safety than their own be themselves all expert swimmer will have dissuade they from that hazard but they be ignorant of the peril will needs pass onne and at the last meet with such a boor as the seaman term it and violent encounter of two tide come in a dangrous boor at carripoory which like two furious enrage ram or bull rush together and oft retire back to return again with great violence until the one by force have overbear the other that if next under God the diligent care and pain of the indian have not preserve they they have be there destroy and swallow up by that merciless boor or breach of water which God be thank they escape and return home in safety here may your highness fit note and observe two thing two special thing to be observe the one the assure love and fidelity of the indian to our nation who have in their power for six week space four only of our company and two of those the chief of the rest and if they have be false and treacherous mind towards they the fidelity of the indian may easy have drown starve or slay they yet do not only forbear to practice harm against they but do also safe row their boat night by night prepare their lodging in the wood and daily use their care and best endeavour to discover and prevent all danger that may happen to they and to guide they serve they and provide they meat such trust and faithfulness be rare find among such barbarous infidel and yet we have have three year experience thereof the other thing to be observe here the plenty of victual be the store and plenty of victual in Guiana where sixty four person together in one company without any provision of victual bread and drink except before hand make can travel abroad for six week space most common lodging in the wood seldom in any town or village and yet in all place wheresoever they come can ready get meat sufficient for they all which blessing God have give to Guiana for the comfort of all such as shall be willing to be planter there this and much more can my brother have true avouch if he have live but since his return into England it have please God who give he life and preserve he from many danger to take he to his mercy but the other captain Harvey survive who life have ever suit with a generous and worthy spirit profess arm and follow the war who also be general well know to be a gentleman both honest and of spotless reputation he will aver and justify for truth what here be mention but I will now return from whence I have digress when I have as before take possession at Gomeribo Gomeribo deliver to a indian as the king tenant in presence of the say party I deliver the possession of that mountain to my indian Anthony Canabre to have hold possess and enjoy the same to he and to his heir for ever of our sovereign lord king james his heir and successor as his subject yield and pay yearly the ten part of all tobacco Cotton wool Annoto and other commodity whatsoever which shall hereafter be either plant or grow within the say mountain if it be demand the indian most glad receive the possession upon these condition and for himself and his posterity do promise to be true subject unto the king majesty his heir and successor and to pay the duty impose upon they and so that business be finish I return again to Wiapoco now most worthy prince there come unto my knowledge a inconvenience happen by the careless negligence of the master of my ship who have the charge of provide and lay in the provision and victual for the voyage the only cause of loss by the voyage which be the cause that I gain no present profit by it but leave off all my discovery in the first beginning I have a purpose at that time to perform a business which may have prove profitable and honourable unto we if I have be able to have stay the time but it be not my chance to be so fortunate for the master his mate and the steward of my ship come unto i and tell i plain that if I make any long abode in that country I will never in those ship return into England or if I do adventure it myself and all my company will starve at sea for want of beer cider and water for all my cask be spoil because it be not iron-bound the wooden hoop fly off by reason of the heat of the climate and our beer and cider whereof we have good store do leak about the ship that we can hardly save sufficient to relieve we if we make a long stay upon the coast which be the master fault have have a special charge to be careful of that only point by this default I be constrain to make a virtue of necessity and prepare myself for England and leave my former purpose to be accomplish hereafter which shall be do God aid i in time convenient then dispose of my company capt. Michael harcourt leave commander of the company I appoint my brother captain Michael harcourt to remain in the country as chief commander in my absence and to continue the possession on the king behalf I give he direction to travel abroad as occasion serve to discover the country to spend sometime at Cooshebery and sometime also in other place but to make his chief residence at Wiapoco the only rendezvous for ship that trade upon that coast and there to plant good store of Maix for our relief of bread and drink which be the chief thing to be respect in those part for other victual we need not take much care be always easy provide he perform his charge with great reputation discover many goodly province and spacious country and worthy continue the possession full three year complete I leave with he for his assistance captain Harvey above mention who have noble vow his time and fortune to be employ in the prosecution of this honourable action for his lieutenant I appoint Mr. Edward gifford twenty man leave with captain harcourt at Waipoco a valiant and worthy gentleman and I leave also with he of gentleman and other about twenty more with all such necessary as I can spare and think convenient for they and so commend they to God the eighteen day of August I depart from Wiapoco and the day follow arrive at Caiane at my come to Caiane my pinnace receive a leak the pinnace receive a leak at Caiane which will have prove dangerous if we have be far at sea whereby enforce to attend the stop thereof and new trim of the pinnace and unwilling to be idle in the mean space do nothing I leave my ship there to repair their defect and in my shipboate depart thence the twenty three of August take with i captain Fisher who have ever be since we first creep into the world my chief companion both in arm and travel I take also with i his brother Vnton Fisher Mr. cradle the master mate of my ship and about six more I follow the coast to the westward stir due west r.

which he have then find much like unto rosetree grow about half a yard in height whereof for the strangeness of they I can forbear to add a word or two these plant or little tree have assure the sense of feeling tree which have the sense of feeling as plain appear by touch they for if you do but touch a leaf of the tree with your finger that leaf will present shrink and close up itself and hang down as if it be dead and if you do cut off a leaf with a pair of scissors than all the other leave grow upon the same tree will instant shrink and close up themselves and hang down as if they be dead and wither and within half a quarter of a hour will by degree open themselves again and flourish as before and as often as you do either touch or cut off any of they they will do the like which do evident show a restriction of the spirit invincible argue a sense howsoever this may seem strange and incredible to your highness and to they that have not see it Scallger 181. sect. 28. yet forasmuch as Scaliger and Bartas make mention of the like I dare be bold to affirm it upon my credit Bartas Eden 1. day 2. week have see and show it to forty other I gather two of the plant and do set they in pot in their own earth and carry they aboard my ship where I keep they fair grow almost a fortnight until they be destroy by certain monkey that break loose and pull they in piece which may have be

that they be very much molest by the Carib the spaniard much molest by the Carib and know not how by any mean to suppress they we stay at de Hispania until the seven day in hope to get some good tobacco among the spaniard who daily feed we with delay and fair word but in truth they have none good at that present for we which we perceive they depart from Trinidado depart thence upon the 7. day about one of the clock in the morning leave the other ship to attend their trade and stand away for the passage call Les^^iot Drago and disembogue about eight of the clock the same morning then we steer away for a island call meve they arrive at meve and leave the island of Granado saint Vincent Guadalupa and Monserate in our starboard side we arrive there the twelve day where we stop to take in ballast and more water for our ship be very light in this island there be a hot bath a excellent hot bath at meve which as well for the report that I have hear as also for that I have see and find by experience I do hold for one of the best and most sovereign in the world I have hear that diverse of our nation have there be cure of the leprosy and that one of the same person now or late dwell at Wollwich near the river of Thames by who the truth may be know if any man desire to be further satisfy therein as for my own experience although it be not much yet the effect that I find it work both in myself and other of my company in two day space do cause i to conceive the best of it for at my come thither a extreme cough cure by the bath I be grievous vex with a extreme cough which I much fear will turn i to great harm but by bathe in the bath and drink of the water I be speedy cure and ever since that time I have find the state of my body I give God thanks for it far exceed what it be before in strength and health moreover one of my company name John Huntbatch servant to my brother as he be make a fire a man hand burn with gunpowder and by the bath cure in 24 hour burn his hand with gunpowder and be in doubt thereby to lose the use of one or two of his finger which be shrink up with the fire but he go present to the bath and wash and bathe his hand a good space therein which soople his finger in such manner that with great ease he can stir and stretch they out and the fire be so wash out of his hand that within the space of twenty four hour by twice or thrice wash

in a day this can I affirm and bold justify have be a eye witness thereof hence we depart the sixteen day of October they depart from meve in the afternoon and leave the island of St. Christopher St. Martin and Anguilla on the starboard side we dissembogue through the break island on the north side of Anguilla upon St. Luke day where I think never Englishman dissembogue before we for we find all our sea-charts false concern that place those break island be place therein to the southward of Anguilla between it and St. martin and we find they to the northward thereof when we have clear ourselves of the break island we stand away north-east shape our course the near way we can for flores and corue and so continue with fair weather the wind still mend upon we until the thirty day of October about twelve of the clock that day there begin a storm with contrary wind still variable which continue until 4. the next day in the afternoon in this storm we lose the company of the pinnace in the night but have fight of she again upon the four of November late in the evening and the next day she come up unto we at two of the clock in the afternoon then the wind come fair at west they leave the pinnace to follow after they and we steer away east by north and e. n. Eastamong the seven of November I relieve the pinnace with more bread and leave she to follow after we not be able to keep way with we before the wind which then blow strong at west for I be very unwilling to lose the benefit of a speedy passage which the continuance of that fair wind be like to afford we and so follow our course on the eleven day in the morning we have sight of fayal they fall with fayal one of the island of the tercera which we leave on our starboard side and steer away for England the wind continue fair until the twenty four day but than it change first to the east by north and then to the east southeast and become so violent and furious that for three day space we be not able to bear out sail but do drive before the wind at the least three league a watch they be drive by a storm into Ireland out of our course and the first land we make be cape clear in the south-west part of Ireland where against our will we arrive at Crook haven the twenty nine of November our arrival there at that present their great necessity and want be happy for we consider our extreme want and great necessity for of all our store we have remain but one hogshead of water half a hogshead of beverage all our beer be spend and waste by leakage six piece of beef and three of pork which be all our provision we have neither fish butter oil cheese nor pease leave to relieve we whereby we have fall into a lamentable distress if almighty God have not in time bring we unto this harbour where we supply our want by the help of captain Reignolds commander of his majesty pinnace call the moon who we fortunate meet there altogether unexpected but the wind continue contrary at the east and like to hold still in that corner presage new want to ensue if a speedy remedy be not provide to prevent the worst I resolve to go by land to Yoghall near unto which place remain some friend and acquaintance of i by who I may provide myself of mean to defray my charge until my return into England and therefore give commandment to the master of my ship to wage a pilot and upon the first shift of wind if it favour he in any time to bring the ship about to Yoghall where I mean to abide his come resolve thence to go for Bristol and I appoint if the wind do hold against he to send he money to supply their victual until it please God to alter it but he regard his own private end more than my command and direction upon the first shift of wind go away with my ship without my knowledge to Dartmouth in the west country and leave i behind in Ireland whereof as soon as I have intelligence I present take the opportunity of a speedy passage in a bark then ready bind for Bristol and so the next morning be the fifteen of December I depart from Yoghall and arrive at Bristol the day my pinnace which we leave at sea to follow after we the pinnace first arrive in Ireland and afterward at Bristol be likewise by the aforesaid storm drive into the west of Ireland to a place call Dingen coushe and there remain along time wind-bound but at the last by God permission arrive at Bristol the second day of February during the time of my voyage we leave but one land-man who die in Guiana and one sailor and a indian boy the number of those that die who die at sea in our return and during the space of these three year last pass since the voyage of all the man which I leave in the country be in number about thirty there die but six whereof one be drown another be a old man of threescore year of age and another take his death by his own disorder the rest die of sickness as please God the giver of life for which small loss his holy name be bless now and ever have thus most noble prince declare the whole course of my voyage to Guiana perform in the year of our lord 1609. I hold it needful for the better satisfaction of the favourer and wellwiller of this action by add of a special note or two and by a brief reremembrance of some point mention in the former discourse to express the worthiness of the enterprise be of importance and not to be regard light in every foreign action undertake by the subject of a christian prince three principal end to be observe in every foreign action they ought to have especial regard to three principal end and design first that it may be for the glory of God second for the honour of their sovereign three for the benefit and profit of their country which three principal end and intendment if they faithful prosecute and labour to advance with constant resolution they shall infallible bring their undertake to bless prosperous and honourable end and now if it shall appear that this enterprise for discovery and plantation in Guiana be chief ground upon these three design I hope there be not any man be he never so malicious and full of envy that can with just exposition scandalize it or worthy contemn it first then for the glory of God 1. the glory of God it have be and ever will be hold clear and unquestionable that God can be more honour nor his holy name by any mean more glorify then by the prosperous growth and happy increase of his church through the conversion of those that be heathen and barbarous nation to the knowledge of he our true God his son jesus Christ and the holy ghost the bless individual Trinity and to the profession and practice of Christianity which heavenly and ever memorable work may through God good blessing and assistance without which indeed all our travel therein and all the labour of the world be but lose be easy effect and accomplish in Guiana the people thereof be of a love and tractable nature towards the english who they love and prefer before all other stranger whatsoever and by who next under God I very hope and be constant persuade it will be their bless hap to be free from the servitude of the devil that now so tyrannize over they and to be lead out of that infernal darkness wherein they live and be draw to Christianity for they will come unto we already at time of prayer show reverence and be very attentive all the while although they understand nothing they will be content that we baptize their child and will after call they by the christian name we give they suffer we to bring they up and in a sort acknowledge their ignorance and show a kind of willingness to be instruct and reform as touch the second by what mean may our gracious sovereign the king majesty do God better service 2. the honour of our sovereign and honour he more or under he be more honour then by obtain and gain the sovereignty of so many great spacious and goodly country and territory not yet actual possess and inhabit by any christian prince or sit whatsoever which in that region by the timely and worthy undertake of his subject without bloodshed and with the love and affection of the people may be possess plant and annex to his crown as the nation and country beyond by the emperor Charles the five be annex to the crown of Spain whereby what honour and benefit the spaniard have gain and to what a degree of greatness they be thereby grow these part of the world can witness and we for our part have have trial and may have have woeful experience of if our god that always take our part an. 1588. have not cross their bloody design and put they to flight and confusion and for the three the profit of our country who can deny but that our country by this worthy action may be enrich through diverse and sundry commodity of great worth in those part daily find and easy obtain which before be mention more at large from page 31. to page 37. and therefore needless here to be again repeat and for their further satisfaction and more encouragement in this enterprise let they consider the nature and disposition of the climate in this region of Guiana which for healthful and wholesome air some few place only except I hold general to be inferior to none other under heaven for notwithstanding it be situate under the equinoctial by the ancient philosopher call the burn zone the burn zone habituable yet such be the wonderful work of God for the benefit of man that contrary to their opinion we find by late experience that those region which be in time pass by they account unhabitable through extremity of drought and heat be now find out to be inhabit temperate and healthful country as plain appear in diverse patt of the east and west indies and especial in this country of Guiana whereof I have take possession to his majesty use be plentiful inhabit by people of diverse nation the climate there pleasant and agreeable to our constitution the clmate pleasant fruitful and healthful and the soil fruitful as before have be declare afford as many admirable help towards the lead of a happy life as any know part of the world for whatsoever be necessary for the relief of man either for food physic or chirurgery or for clothing and architecture be here by the providence and goodness of God the creator in plentiful store even natural provide moreover the good inclination of the people towards our nation the love of the people towards our nation be willing to trade with we and become subject to his majesty our sovereign their love and gentle entertain of we desire to have we live and abide among they and their tractable conversation with we not refuse to be instruct in Christianity and covet to imitate and learn any trade or work that they see use or practise by our man be no small motive to persuade the prosecution of this action and plantation in Guiana furthermore a good motive to those that want employment all young gentleman soldier and other that live at home in idleness and want employment may here find mean to abandon and expel their slothful humour and cast off their fruitless and pernicious design and may worthy exercise their generous spirit in honourable travel and famous discovery of many goodly and rich terretory strange and unknown nation and a multitude of other rarity hitherto unseen and unheard off in these part of the world which may be think incredible but that our own experience and the general and constant report and affirmation of the indian do assure we thereof and to conclude a empire may be gain to our sovereign we may by the gracious assistance of our good God gain unto our sovereign the dominion of a rich and mighty empire which if it may be once possess by his majesty and inhabit by his english subject will absolute be invincible to the unspeakable honour and renown of our nation in all after age all these thing respective consider what may be more require to move and induce all noble and worthy disposition love honour and honourable attempt all merchant desire wealth and riches and general all the inhabitant of this kingdom free to give assistance towards the advancement of this noble action and plantation so much tend to the glory of God the honour of our sovereign and the benefit of our country  the name of the river fall into the

mean sort first the climate in Guiana although it be hot yet be it habitable the nature of the climate page 23. and afford healthful habitation for in three year space that my brother captain Michael harcourt and his company remain in the country of thirty person there die but six the natural inhabitant of that country be a love the disposition of the people tractable and gentle people affect and prefer the englishman before all other nation whatsoever and desire commerce and conversation with they with those barbarous people we may live in safety without suspicion of treachery or dread of danger if wilful we offer they abuse and harm issue the fault be we for a worm be tread on will turn again if they at any time do give offence to we they will suffer and abide such moderate chastisement as we in our discretion shall think fit to lay upon they the soil of the land there the quality of the land page 27. as be say before be exceed rich never yet break up nor overwear with tillage but still remain in the great perfection of fertility the provision of that country for victual be already mention before but it be fit they be again remember for the comfort of the ordinary people the provision of the country page 27. 28. 30. and 31. that in person shall adventure in this action there be great store of deer of all sort wild swine hare and coney beside diverse other beast unknown in these part pheasant partridge wild foul of all sort and every house have cock hen and chicken as in England and the variety of fish be wonderful without compare but the chief comfort for our countryman be this that the beast call Maypury and the fish call the sea cow be several as big as a heifer of two year old a beast and a fish like beef and of which kind there be very many be in eat so like unto our english beef that hardly in taste we can distinguish they and may as well as beef be salt and keep for our provision there be also a beast in colour like a fawn a beast like mutton but full of white spot in stature somewhat less than a small sheep and in taste like mutton but be rather better meat the Baremo be also of the same taste these for the time will give we good content until we can be store with the breed of our english sheep and cattle the store of Maix good bread or Guinea wheat in Guiana be very plentiful which grain do make a excellent good bread and very wholesome so likewise do the Cassavi whereof there be also great abundance and much more may be drink like march beer as we please to plant of the Cassavi bread the indian do make good drink which in colour taste and strength do equal our march beer in England of the Guinea wheat excellent strong Ale we may make good malt which also make as excellent strong ale as can be possible the soil be rich fruitful and never nip with frost do give we hope that in few year space by plant vine sack and canary wine we shall make good store of sack and canary wine which in those part be needful and very wholesome and will great comfort and lighten the heart of our countryman and make they jovial and courageous to undertake and execute the great labour and most difficult adventure of discovery the commodity already find in Guiana be at large declare in the former discourse the commodity of the country pag. 31 and 32. yet for the better memory of those that be dispose to adventure in this action I have again in brief remember they first within a year without much labour there may be transport thence good store of Cotton wool diverse kind of rich die sundry sort of gum drug and feather many kind of rich wood jasper and Purphery stone balsamum wax honey and tobacco and hereafter within few year we shall return thence great plenty of sugar and I hope discover as rich mine as ever the Spaniard find either in new Spain Peru or any other part of the indies forasmuch as it have please his excellent majesty for the plant and inhabit of all that part of Guiana or continent of America lie between the river of amazon and the river of Dessequebe to grant his gracious letter patent to Robert harcourt of stanton harcourt in the county of Oxford esquire sir Thomas Challener knight and John Rovenzon esquire and to the heir of the say Robert harcourt of all the say country land and territory between the say two river of amazon and Dessequebe and of all island land and territory within twenty league adjacent thereunto etc. together with all prerogative jurisdiction royalty privilege franchise and Preheminenses both for government trade traffic and otherwise in as large and ample manner as either his majesty or any of his noble progenitor or predecessor have heretofore grant to any adventurer or undertaker of any discovery plantation or traffic of in or into any foreign part whatsoever to have hold possess and enjoy all and singular the premise to the sole and proper use of the say Robert harcourt and his heir for ever and for that diverse honourable personage gentleman and other who be willing and desirous for the glory of God and the honour of our nation to give aid and assistance either in person or purse to the undertake of this worthy action and plantation may true understand and know how and in what manner they shall receive benefit and profit by their adventure and travel therein it be think fit and necessary for their better content and satisfaction to publish these article ensue the planter in general be all adventurer either in person or purse the mean adventurer in person shall have five hundred acre as a single share every one that adventure twelve pound ten shilling shall have five hundred acre as a single share and so rateable according to the adventure be it more or less the plantation and adventure be intend to be partly general and partly particular in the general plantation and adventure all person of all condition and estate even to the poor servant and laborer man woman and child may adventure asmuch or as little as they please from ten shilling upward and shall have in fee simple the assure ratable increase and gain according to the quantity of his adventure so as for every ten shilling adventure he shall have twenty acre in inheritance and so much yearly profit as those twenty acre may yield a register shall be true keep of the name of every adventurer in person and of every adventurer in money and of the sum by he adventure to the end that they may proportionable receive the full benefit of their adventure during the first three year the whole benefit shall go towards the advancement of the plantation at the end of those three year a four part of the clear profit remain shall be divide betwixt all the adventurer in purse or person rateable according to their share and adventure yearly for seven year after the first three year end three part of the whole clear yearly profit upon every return shall be in like manner divide and the other four part shall go towards the advancement of the plantation in those ten year the land may be survey and fit distribution and alotment make thereof to the adventurer and planter after those ten year it shall be free for every one to make his best of his alotment at his own discretion by himself or else to trade and deal in common as he do before with other which perhaps will be most convenient for all small adventurer and a settle order shall for that end be continue for a continual joint and common trade and commerce for ever for otherwise it may prove hard for adventurer of small sum to reap any benefit after the ten year end but by a common continue commerce they or their heir or assign shall be sure to have it a treasurer general for the plantation shall be resident in London and when the return of profit dividable shall be he shall forthwith deliver to a particular treasurer resident in every shire the proportionable part or profit due to the adventurer of that shire which particular treasurer shall deliver to the high constable of every hundred the proportionable part due to the adventurer of that hundred and the high constable shall deliver to the constable and minister of every parish within their hundred where any adventurer shall be the proportionable part due to the adventurer of that parish and the constable and minister shall deliver to every person in that parish his due according to the proportion of his adventure to this end a register shall be keep by the constable and minister of each parish of the name of each adventurer in that parish with their several adventure and the time when they bring in the same so as such as he remove out of a parish where they adventure to some other place shall either themselves or their heir or assign receive his proportionable profit in the parish where he adventure without further trouble or travel the like register shall remain with the high constable of the adventurer in their hundred and the like with the particular treasurer of that shire of the adventurer of that shire and the like of all the adventurer whatsoever with the treasurer general for the plantation but yet such as adventure not before this next intend voyage which we account the first voyage for the plantation or before the second but stay long expect the event must not expect equal share with the first adventurer but if his adventure come in after the second voyage and before the three he shall want a five part of that which the first adventurer shall have and such as come in before the four voyoge shall want two five part and such as come in before the five voyage shall want three five part and such as come in before the six voyage which perhaps may be the last voyage in the first three year a voyage be say forth every half year shall want four five part of what the first adventurer shall have and so a single share for so late a adventurer of twelve pound ten shilling will be but one hundred acre in inheritance and his profit according in proportion and so for a great or lesser rate so late adventure every adventurer in person if he die have neither wife nor child in Guiana live his next kinsman that will go in person at the next voyage or send after his decease shall have his share or part but if none such will go in person than the next heir of the decease in England shall have a five part of that share in inheritance be about one hundred acre and the residue be four hundred acre shall be dispose of to some other that will go in person that so by the death of the party decease the number of the planter in person may not be diminish and that yet his next heir here may have some competent benefit by the adventure of his kinsman person if a man and his wife go each of they shall have five hundred acre yet so that the share of the wife be at the husband dispose as be use by husband in England that marry woman heir who can alien the same without the wife consent if a man and his wife go the survivor shall have the other share if they have no child bear in Guiana but if they have child bear there then only the survivor shall have the share of the decease until the child be one and twenty year old and then the child shall have it for that the share of the personal adventure of the survivor will be competent maintenance so as the child may well have the other share if a man and his wife and a child of they go each shall have five hundred acre the share of commander officer and man of place and quality that adventure in person be not to be rate according to single share of inferior and common person that adventure in person but according to their place quality and merit in such sort as shall be fit to give they content and encouragement to adventure their person in so honourable and worthy a action divine preacher that will imitate the glorious example of the apostle who cease not to travel among all sort of heathen and savage people for the plantation of the holy gospel be worthy number among the person of place and quality and shall have such worthy share for the adventure of their person in (@) service of the bless trinity as shall give they good content thus much concern the general adventure and plantation in the particular plantation and adventure there shall be certain signiory or other portion of land allot and grant to such as like not to be partaker of the general plantation and adventure but have
