The first Dialogue. Of Contractes.

NOmomathes.
I pray you Codicgnostes let me know whether any persons are by law prohibited to make any co^tract:1. Diuision. deliuer your knowledge herein, and let your companions speake to this point, and others that I shal propose, when and as farre forth as shall seeme good vnto them.


Codicg.
The chiefe ground of contracts is co^sent,1. The ground of contractes. L. 1. ff. de pactis, and in c. Antig. Eo. tit. de pact. and l. co^ sens. ff. de action. and oblig. l. 1. ff. manda. Et l. sicut C. de actio. and obli. so that the persons which contract must be able to co^sent, and consent groweth of knowledge and from a mans free wil, directed by sufficient vnderstanding: for he that knoweth not what he doth, can not be said to be willing to2. The contracts of infants, persons distracted of their wittes, and religious persons, whether or how farre foorth they be good. do a thing: as a man that is distract of his wittes: or an infant that is within yeares of discre^ion, l. 5. ff. ad leg: Falcid. l. 12 de leg. and the contract or couenant of such persons is not ratified by oath, which by law are forbidden to contract, l. non dubiu^ C. de legib. as Monkes and Fryers and such like religious persons.


Canonologus.
Indeede such persons are said in our lawe to be mortui mundo, dead to the world, 16. q. vltim. c. si. and they cannot liue without their Cloister no more then a fish without the water, 16. q. 1. plac. and he can haue nothing priuate or proper to himselfe, and therefore the rule of the Canon-law is Monachus habens aliquid de proprio sepeliri debet in sterquilinio, De sta. mo. c. 2. and C. ad monaster. Ca. 1. and 2. de postula. 16. q. 1. monach. etc. religios. de procur. in cler. and he ca^ not be any mans aduocate in a cause, or any mans proxie without the consent of his
 Abbot or Soueraigne, and that must be to the vse and behoofe of his monasterie, and the like law is of Friers. Cle. dud. de sepul. and Cle. ex^ri de parad. de verbo sig.


Nomomathes.
But is there no differe^ce in the Lawe, betwixt the contracts of infants and the contracts of Monkes and Friers?


Codicgn.
Yes very great: For Monkes and3. Monkes are absolutely prohibited by the Ciuill lawe to make any co^tract: infants are disabled with a certaine qualification. Friers are prohibited by Lawe to make any contract, so that as I haue abouesaid, their contract can not be good though it be co^firmed by oath: But infants are not ture prohibiti, but inhabiles ex iuris dispositione, and therfore their contracts may by oath be established Authent. sacramenta puberu^ cum tota sua materia. C. si aduer. ve^dit. and in corpore vnde sumitur..


Anglonomoph.
As the former Lawes haue very greatly disabled Monkes and religious persons, who are tied to a certaine rule: so our Law hath very much diminished their ability, as to their intermedling in secular matters. In a Scire facias brought by a Prior against a parson out of a recouery had against his predecessor, it was4. That by the Common law Priors vnder the obedience of a Soueraigne, and which weare datife and remoueable, could not impleade or bee impleaded without their soueraigne, vnlesse it were by speciall custome. held that the defendant should not be estopped by the admittance of his predecessor in the first action, to pleade in this Scire facias that the Priour was a Monke professed vnder the obedience etc. and was datife and remoueable, 34. H. 6. 2. for though it haue beene helde that a Prior perpetuall may prescribe to implead and to be impleaded without his Soueraigne, yet by common intent a Prior datife and remoueable at the will of the party shall haue no action by such vsage, but if he wil haue any plea he must shew some special matter, 39. E* 3. 34. and it hath bene said that the knights of
 S. Iohn of Ierusalem had their possessions seuerall,5. The same Lawe was of the knights of S. Iohn of Ierusalem. yet they could not vse an action without their Prior, 32. H. 6. 5* and 31. and a Prior which was presentable, and had Couent and Common seale, could not before the dissolution of Abbeys and Priories charge his house in perpetuum, without the assent of the Patron and Ordinarie, neyther could hee haue the Writte De aduocatione decimarum, nor a iuris vtrum, 12. H. 4. Stath. tit. Charge. and a writte was abated beyng brought against a Prioresse, because the Prior of S. Iohnes was commaunder of the house whereof shee was Prioresse, and because she was made Prioresse by him, and was vnder his obedience, and remoueable at his will, notwithstanding that shee had Couent and Common seale and had her possessions seuerall, and was wonte to Lease the lande for tearme of yeares, 12. R. 2. Nonabilitie. 4. and if a contract bee made with an Abbotte and his Monke, the writ that hath beene grou^ded vpon this contract hath bene brought against the Abbot onely, 33. E. 3. B^^ 913. 2. H. 4. 21. and so hath a writte of Detinue bene brought being co^ceiued vpo^ a deliuery of goods made to the Monke to the vse of the Abbot, Ibidem. yet it hath bene thought that an action will lie against a Monke, if he be not in subiection to some Soueraigne. 14. H. 4. 37. But it hath bene taken for a general learning with vs that Monkes and Friers, and Canons professed and the like, could not grant any thing, 14. H. 8. 16. 2. R. 3. 5. 32. H. 6. 31. neither could they be grau^tees of any thing, 5. H. 7. 25. 19. H. 6. 25. neither are they capable by way of deuise, Perk. tit. Deuis. sect. 537 and the coue^t of an Abbey or Priorie can yeeld so little aduantage to the house in
 matter of purchase, that if in former times land had beene giuen to an Abbot and to his couent, this could not be good saue onely during the life of the Abbot for the want of this word (successors) 11. H. 4. 84. ^ Curi. but touching the abilitie of infants in contractes and purchases the Lawe is diuerse according to the diuersitie of cases, and if an infant do buy of any a coate or necessarie vestme^t for a certaine summe, or if he make a couenant for his meate paying 12. d. a weeke according to M. Paston his opinion, this couenant is void, yea and if6. The infants contract for his meate, apparell, and necessaries is good, if he be of the age of fourtene yeres. hee make a bonde for it, the bonde likewise is void: but Markeham thinketh the contrarie if the infant that is so bond be of the age of fourtene yeares, 21. H. 6. 31. 18. E. 4. 2. Perk. Grau. 4. D. S. dial. 2. fo. 113. and by M. Brookes opinion this is the better Law, Br. Labourers 30. and if an infant lease land for tearme of yeares rendring a rent, or doe sell a horse or7. That which an infant doth without actual liuery may bee auoyded by action without entre o^ seisure but that which he doth by actuall liuery can not be auoided without entre o^ seisure. any other thing he may chose to haue an action of dette for the rent reserued vpon the Lease, or a writte of trespasse for the occupation of the lande, and so he may haue an action of trespasse for the occupation of a thing sold by him: and if an infant doe giue to one a horse without actuall deliuerie of the horse into his hands at the time of the gift and the donee taketh the Horse by reason of this gifte, the infant may haue an action of Trespasse against him, 18. E. 4. 2. and if an Infant make an Obligation or Lease in writing and enseale it, and deliuer it to a straunger as a scrowle to deliuer to him to whom it is made when the infant commeth to full age as his deed, and the straunger doth it, this is
 voide, because it is done by a commaundement, which is void, 27. H. 6. 7. for the co^mandement or assent of an infant is voide in law 11. Ass. pl. 14, so that a difference is to be held, where an infant passeth away a thing to an other by liuery in facto and where not: for in the one case the gift or conueyance is voidable onely, in the other it is void to all intents. For if an infant make a lease for tearme of yeares or a lease by dures, if the lessee enter, the infant may haue an assise, but if the infant make a feoffement and deliuer seisin accordingly, he shall haue no assise, for by the liuery of seisin the feoffee had a possession at will at the least: but if hee make a letter of attorney to deliuer seisin he may haue an assise, 9. H. 7. 24. and 2. Mar. 109. Dyer, Rug. case but where any man doth a thing which is for the profite of an infant he shall not bee punished as a trespasser, as if an infant commaunde one to repayre his houses and he doth it, this shall excuse him in an action of trespasse. 13.

Nomomathes.
You haue spoken sufficiently2. Diuision. Anglonomop. of religious persons and infantes, and of contracts made by them: Now I pray you1. Whether the contract of the serua^t shall be acco^pted in Lawe the contract of the mayster. shew vnto me whether the contract of the seruaunt shall be accompted in lawe the contract of the maister.


Anglonomop.
It hath bene held in our bookes that if a man haue a Baily or seruaunt who is2. That according to the common Law the mayster shall be bound by the co^tract of a knowne seruant, if the knowne for his seruaunt, if hee sende him to fayres or markets, to buy, to selle, or to doe other thinges markettable, his maister shall be charged with the payment, if the thing which
 is Marchandized doe come to his vse, 2. R. 2. Dette 3. per Curi. and itthing Merchandised doe come to his vse: and he shall be bound by the co^tract of his factor though the goods neuer came to his possession. hath beene likewise helde that if a man sende his boy to the market to buy thinges for him and he buyeth them and bringeth them to him, and the vendor bringeth an action against the Maister and auerreth that the goods came to his vse, hee shall recouer against him in the action, 4. E. 2. Dette 168. and Pigot his opinion is that if one make an other man his Factor to buy thinges for him, if hee buy Merchandize of any, the Maister shall be charged by this contract though the goods neuer came to his possession, because hee hath giuen vnto him such a power, 8. E. 4. 1. and 9. Dutches de Suffolkes case, per Pigot. But in the eightenth yeare of King Edwarde the second a man was bound in a recognisance to S. to paie at a certaine daie, at which daie the Reconusor came and proferred the monie in Court, and because S. was in the Kinges seruice3. The acte of a mans Attorney or his general receyuor, doth not binde the maister without speciall warrant. there came one A. as his generall Attourney, and saide that hee was readie to receiue the monie and shewed foorth to the Court a warrant of Attourney, but because the warrant of Attourney was that hee should bee his Attourney In placitis and quaerelis ad lucrandum and perdendum, and the Recognisans was a thing already adiudged and determined, and therefore could neither bee plea nor quarrell, therefore it was thought that his warrant did not extend to receiue money, 18. E. 2. Execut 245. so in an action of dette brought vpon an obligation the defendant did confesse the deed, and saide that he had paid the summe to one C. the generall receyuor of the plaintife,
 and hee made thereof an acquittaunce which hee shewed foorth to the Court, but because hee had acknowledged the obligation, and had shewed no warrant of the plaintife, to pay the sayd money to C. so that the acquittance which was shewed, could not bee the deede of the plaintife, The Courte awarded that the plaintife should recouer his dette and his dammages, 5. E. ^. 63. but as to a mans seruaunt I take the Lawe to bee that his contract shall extend to his Maister, as well for preiudice as aduauntage, And therefore if a mans seruant sell to one certaine clothe, and warrant it to bee of a certaine length the action will lie against the Maister onely, and not against the seruaunt, and if A. doe assume to cure B. of a wound and hee sendeth his seruaunt to B. to lay medicines to the wound, whereby hee is hurte and empayred, B. can not haue his action vpon the case against the Seruaunt but against the Maister, 11. E. 4. 6. p* Choke and Brian and of late time the Lord North being Chauncellour of the augmentation Courte, deliuered an Obligation made to Queene Marie to his Seruaunt to deliuer ouer to the Clarke of the augmentations, the Obligee and the Seruaunt did conspire and cancell the Obligation, the Maister was helde in this case to bee chargeable. 5. Mari. 161. Dyer per Iustitia^.

You haue satisfied mee touching3. Diuision. contracts made by a mans seruaunt, now I pray1. Whether the wifes contract made in the behalfe of you show me whether a contract made by the wife in the behalfe of the husband will binde
 the husband.the husbande, will binde the husband.


Anglonomoph.
In an action of debt brought against husband and wife, and an other, vpon2. That by the common Law an action of dette brought vpon a co^tract made by the wife for the behoofe of the husband must be brought onely against the husband, without naming the wife. a contract made during the couerture, for the woman it was said, that a feme couert can not make a contract, wherefore iudgement was demaunded of the action, and the husband and the third person pleaded the same matter to the writte, and they could not be admitted to plead to the writte, because the woman had pleaded to the action: but they pleaded the matter abouesaid in barre of the action, and were receyued, 34. E. 3. Briefe 923. and if the husband and the wife doe borowe money, this shall be accompted the borowing of the husband onely, 33. E. 3. Briefe 913. and if a mans wife doe buy goods of one to the vse of her husband, the wife is not in such case to be named in the writte, that is to be brought hereupon. 2. H. 4. 21. p. Markeham.


Codicgn.
By our Law, no mans contract made3. That by the Ciuill Law the husband is in no sorte to be charged by the contract of his wife. in the behalfe of an other, will binde the other, but such a persons contract who may be bound for the other. C. and ff. de pact. in congr. tit.

You haue shewed vnto me aboundantly, how contracts may stand good, and how they may be infringed by reason of the persons, which are parties or agents in the stipulation or contract and efficient causes thereof, by reason of their ability or disability possitiuely set down in Law, now I would haue you proceed to declare how by the materiall causes of contracts, they may stand or fall.



Codicgn.
A contract hath a materiall substance4. Diuision. 1 How contractes may stand or fal by their material causes, or the defect of the^. whereof it is made, as well as other thinges, and the materiall cause of a contract is the thing for which wee doe contract: for as in mechanicall and artificiall thinges there is required some apt matter, D. L. adeo @. cum quid. whereof a thing may be wrought, so in contracts and conuenants as well these which are determinable by the Law of nations, as these which are sentenced by the Ciuil Law and other Lawes, to the end they may be well perfited andv) ff. de verb. oblig. l. inter Stipulant*. @. sacram^et de praescripre verb. l. insula. concluded, some materiall cause is requisite. u


Nomom.
Why, are any contractes ordered by5. Diuision. 1 Some contracts are ordered by the law of Natio^s. the Law of Nations?


Codicgn.
Yea, for by that Law an Embassador may be impleaded for such contracts as he maketh during the time of his Embassage, least (as Iulianus2 An Embassador may according to the Ciuil Law be impleaded by the Law of nations for a co^tract made whilest he is Embassador. sayeth) hee presume to take other mens goods with him into his owne countrey, L. 25. D. de iud. or (as Paulus reasoneth plainely and pithily) least men fearing to contract with them, if they be not in this regarde subiect to Lawe, they be excluded from all commerce and entercourse of bargaine: L. 24. de min. l. 11. ad Vell. l. 12. de adm. tu. and this Law is supported by that excellent rule of equitie, that no man ought to growe ritcher by an other mans losse, and if one that is no Embassador doe contract with one, and after bee made an Embassador, yet he is now chargeable with the contract: likewise an action will lye against an Embassador by the Law of Nations if hee couenant to performe a thing when hee is Embassador, if it so fall out that the charge and credit of Embassage be committed vnto him.

I am verie desirous to knowe, Codignostes6. Diuision. 1 Whether co^tracts made with Pirats or robbers in the high way be good in Law. whether contractes made with Pirats and with robbers by the high way are auaileable and of force by the Ciuil law, or the Law of nations.


Codig.
I doe not thinke that Pirates and robbers are to haue aduantage by any Lawe in matter of contract, because they haue cast aside all care of humane societie, and seeke to reduce the world as much as lieth in their power, to the pristinate wildnes and sauagnes of nature, when men did liue like beastes, and as Lucretius sayeth. Lucret. li. 5.


Quod praedae obtulerat fortuna cuique, ferebat


Sponte sua sibi quisque valere and viuere doctus.


And such persons may not enioy the benefitte of2 That Pirates and robbers are not to haue aduantage of law in matters of contract. Law to which they are enemies, Paul. l. 63. ad leg. Falc. To such men which haue withdrawne themselues from the communion and societie of men, and (as Florus Flor. lib. 3. sayeth) haue broken the league of mankind, why shoulde the Lawe of nations, which is nothing els but the communion, and league of nations extende any fauour. Pirates (as Plinie saieth) are enemies to all men liuing: Plini lib. 2. ca. 46. and therefore Cicero auoucheth, that if thou doest not bring to robbers or Pirates, the raunsome which thou hast promised for thy life, there is neither offence nor fraudulent dealing in thee, no though thou hast promised with an oathe. Cicer. pro leg. Manil. and 3. de offic. Therefore some doe wonder that D. Hotoman dare affirme, Hotom. 7. Illust. question. that the3 That D. Hotoman erreth greatly in mainteining that Pirats and robbers may lawfully contract. Lawe of nations doth extende to fugitiues and robbers, and his chiefe reason is, because there is no Law which doth intredict and forbid to couenant or contract with them, and such thinges
 in his opinion, as are not verbally forbidden, are implicatiuely permitted, This reason is of no validitie, for it may be implicatiuely forbidden, and in that they may be enemies to all men, and doe spare no man, they ought not to protect themselues by the Lawe of nations, which is the Law of al men: The question is not what may be done vnto them, or how many men haue dealt with them, but howe by rule of equitie and soundnes of reason they ought to be dealt with: For to dispute of Lawe is to dispute of a publike bond, whereby we are bound and obliged, but we are not bound to such lawles, disorderly, and incorrigible persons, by any common respecte of duetie.


Nomom.
I will not trouble you farther Codicg.7. Diuision. with more ample discourse of this matter, but wil rest wel apaied with that which you haue already spoken: Now I lo^g to here somwhat of Anglono. touching the matteriall causes of contracts.


Anglonomo.
A consideration which is the proper1 That by the common Law a consideration ^s the proper mater^al cause of a contract, and that it may be expressed or implyed. material cause of a co^tract, may in the concluding of bargains be either expressed, or implied: expressed, as if I buy a horse of you for xx. s. you may keepe the horse til I haue paied you the mony, 10. E. 4. 18. and M. Choke is of opinion that if you buy of one a horse in Smithfield for a certaine summe of money, and doe not pay him the money presently, hee may sell the horse to any other incontinent, and you can not haue any remedy against him, for otherwise hee might bee compelled to keepe his horse for euer against his will, 17. E. 4. 1. per Choke.
 For it is implyed in the bargaine that the vendee must pay the money incontinent, otherwise he cannot haue the thing solde, but if the payment bee respited vnto a certaine day vpon the contract this is good ynough, so that the money2 That a contract is not good without money payed in hand, or a certaine day of payment limited. be payed within the time prefixed. 21. H. 7. 6. and 28. H. 8. it is positiuely set downe for Lawe that a contracte is not good without present payment vnlesse a certaine day of payment bee limited, so that the one of them may haue an action of debt for the money, the other a writ of Detinue for the wares: 28. H. 8. 30. Dyer. An implied consideration is when the Law it selfe doth intende and enforce a consideration, and therefore the Hoste of a common Inne may deteine a mans horse if he wil not pay him for his horse meate: And so if a Taylor make a gowne for any man he may deteine the gowne till he be paied for his labour. 5. E. 4. 2.


Nomomat.
Doth not the defect of forme in8. Diuision. 1 Whether the defect of forme doe destroy the contract. a contract frustrate and defeate the contract.


Codign.
Yes: for as the substanciall fourme in materiall things is necessary to the essence and constitution of such things: ff. ad exti^b. l. Iulian. @. and l. falsi. l. si is qui. @. quidem. so in contractes a2 That solempnitie and concurrence of circumstances is required in contracts by the Ciuil law. certaine solemnitie and concurrence of circumstances is required for the perfiting of them, as their naturall and proper forme: ff. de verb. obligat' l. sciend. and l. continuus in princip. Eo. l. @. si quis ita. and without such ceremoniousnes the contract is of no force.


Anglonomo.
Our law likewise requireth forme either in pronouncing the wordes of the contract, or els in obseruing some other circumstances belonging to the contract. For the first, if a man promise to another xx. li. with his daughter
 in maryage, if he marrie the daughter and the money be not paied he shall not haue any action of debt, or action vpon the case at the Common Law, but he must sue for this money in the Spirituall3 That matrimoniall contracts, if there be no assumpsit in them, are to be decided by the ecclesiastical Law: if there be an assumpsit, by the common law. Court. Fitz. nat. br. 44. a, 14. E. 4. 6. Reg. 46. and 48. 15. H. 3 Prohibition 22. 16. H. 3. Prohi. 24. For here is no good forme of contract: and (as Master Bracton sayeth) Matrimonium est principale, and eiusdem iuris, id est iurisdictionis esse debet accessorium. Bracton lib. 5. cap. 16. And therefore if a man by reason of matrimonie or testament doe acknowledge in a Spiritual Court that he ought to pay to one a hundreth markes, or some other summe at a certaine day, if the money bee not payed at the day accordingly, he may be sued for this money in the Spirituall Court, and no prohibition lyeth, Fitz. na. br. 41. b. but if in the former case he had promised one x. li. if he would marrie his daughter, if he doe marry his daughter and the other will not pay the money hee may not sue him in the Spirituall Court for this money, but at the Common Law, Fitz. na. br. 44. a, et 22. Ass. pla. 70. p Tho. and 16. H. 3. Prohibit. 22. for now it goeth in fourme of contract, as for the other matter where forme is required in obseruing some other circumstance in the contract, that may appeare by this case: if a felon sell a horse without couin in a market ouert, this doth alter the propertie, and the verie proprietary cannot haue restitution of the horse notwithstanding the statute of 21. H. 8. c. 11. but if he had solde him out of a market ouert the propertie had not bin altered. 33. H. 6. 5. 18. E. 4. 24. 7. H. 7. 12. Crompt. Iust. de Peace 172.

Let me know I pray you how many2. Diuision. kinds of Gifts there be.


Anglonomoph.
They be of diuerse sortes: some1 The diuerse kinds of giftes, some being fre some compensatory. are called free gifts, which proceede merely of a mans good will and beneuolence: others may be called Compensatorie, because they are giuen for some cause or consideration: Gifts or graunts of the first kinde are such as I nowe shall recite out of our bookes. First, the Queene may graunt2 What is wrought by the Queenes graunt ex mero motu. to one lande ex mero motu, and though her highnesse doe rehearse some consideration in the patent of her graunt which is not true, as if the consideration bee, that whereas the grauntee hath done her Maiestie good seruice on the Sea, or beyond the Sea, or in her Maiesties warres, or in some other busines: though the consideration be meerley supposed and not true, and therefore no good consideration in Law, yet the words ex mero motu do make the grant good, 26. H. 8. 1. per Fitz. and whereas the Queene ex certa scientia, and mero motu doth confirme a graunt, supposing that a graunt was made before, where in truth there was no such
 thing, it is held that her highnes shall be concluded to say, that no such graunt was made: otherwise it had bin if this worde (informamur) had3 What is wrought by her Maiesties graunt by words of Informamur. bin vsed in reciting the graunt. 9. H. 7. 2. For if her highnesse graunt any thing vpon the false suggestion of the partie, this graunt is voide, because shee is deceiued in her graunt, 11. E. 4. 1. per Littlet'. and wee haue a rule: Si suggestio non sit vera, literae patentes sunt vacuae. 3. H. 7. 6. For when the graunt is made vpon the suggestion of the partie, the wordes of the graunt shal be taken strictely, but when it is ex mero motu it must be construed and interpreted according to the Kings intent, and as fauorably for the grauntee as reason will permitte, 21. E. 4. 25. Abbe de Walthams case per Browne and Genney. and if a common person do without consideration giue to I.

As to the point of consideration wee3.

Anglonomoph.
When a graunt is non-certaine,2 That a grant non certaine must be taken most strongly against the grauntor. it must be taken most strongly against the grauntor, for if a man graunt an annuitie out of certaine lande, and he hath no lande* at the ^ime of the graunt, yet the graunt shal charge his person, 9. H. 6. 12. p Babingt. and if a deede of graunt be good in parcell, and3 That a gra^t may be good in part, and for parcel not. for parcel not, that which is for the aduantage of the grauntee shalbe taken to be good, as if a man graunt vnto me an annuity, prouiso that it shall not charge his person, the prouiso is voide, and the graunt is good; 20. E. 4. 8. p Towns. 14. H. 4. 30. p Hank. And if an annuitie be graunted pro consilio impendendo, though the grauntee be well skilled in diuerse sciences or faculties, yet counsel shalbe giuen in that facultie only, which was intended at the time of the graunt, 41. E. 3. 6. Annuit^e 19. But in some cases the graunt must be construed according to a reasonable and indifferent intendment, as if a man make a lease of a house, so that the lessee may make his profit of the houses within it, the lessee cannot in this case take downe or demolishe the houses, nor make wast in them, for the intent was not so, 17. E. 3. 17. but if the King graunt to me visum franciplegij in omnibus terris meis, and feadis,
 I cannot haue this in any landes and tenements, which I shall afterwards purchase, 38. H. 6. 10. But4 Howe the ^ Queens grants and licences shalbe construed and interpreted. if the king graunt to a man that he and his heires shalbe quit of taxe for their landes which they haue, this is a good graunt though there be no taxe due at the time of the graunt, Ibid: And so is the Law of Tenths and fifteenes, 19. H. 6. 62. 21. H. 6. 43. 21. E. 4. 45. and he to whom the King graunteth a licence may not vary from the proper sense and the significancy of the words. 18. E. 2. Fines 124. And if the king before the dissolution of Monasteries had licenced an Abbot and his Couent to make a feoffement, if the Abbot onely had made it the feoffement had beene voide, 21. H. 7. 8. And 3. Ed. 3. the King licenced one to leuie a fine of the mannour of Dale, to the intent to maintayne two Chaplaines, and hee woulde haue leuied the fine omitting the Chapleines, but was not suffered, 3. E. 3. 5. and 30. Edward 3. the licence was to leuie a Fine of the Mannour of Dale, and hee woulde haue leuied the Fine with a foreprise or exception of certaine acres, parcell of the Mannour, rendering rent, but was not admitted to it, because it coulde not stande with the licence, which was that all the Manour should bee charged with the rent, 30. E. 3. 17. So if the Queene licence one to make a Feoffement by deede, he cannot make it without deede, 21. H. 7. 8. per Frowike. and this Lawe holdeth likewise in a common persons case, for if hee that hath a warrant of Attourney to deliuer seisin absolutely, doe deliuer-seisin vpon condition this is a disseisin to the feoffour, 12. Ass. p^ 24 And a graunt is not to bee fauoured contrarie
 to the euident and perspicuous sense of the words.5 That a graunt is not to be fauoured contrary to the manifest sense of the words. For if a man graunt to an other a loade of wood to take in his soyle euery yeare, and the grauntee surceaseth the two first yeares, and the third yeare hee taketh three loade, hee is a wronge doer for two of them: so if a man graunt to an other a common for three beastes yearely, and hee taketh nothing the two first yeares, he shal not haue common for three beastes the third yeare. 27. H. 6. 10.

Lorde and three iointenauntes, and the Lorde graunteth the seruices of one of them to a straunger, this is a voyde graunt thoughe the same tenant doe attourne, and suruiue his compaignions. For no attournement can make an euill graunt to bee good, 5. E. 3. 34. and if a man lease lande to the husbande and wife duringe their liues, and after graunteth the reuersion of the
 lande which the husbande holdeth for terme of life, and then attournement is had, the graunte is voide, and the attournement also. 13. E. 3. Bro* Iointen. 63. And if a man be bound to a Fem^ sole, and a straunger releaseth to the obligour, and after maryeth the feme, yet the release is not good. 15. E. 3. Feoffem^t 63. So it is if in auncient time a Monke, Fryer, or Cannon professed, which was no Soueraigne of an house had graunted to one an annuitie, this was a void graunt, though he had bin after dereigned, or made Soueraigne of the same house, or some other. 2.

E. 4. 3. and an other reason why he cannot grant his estate, is because his estate dependeth as well vpon his owne will, as the will of the lessor, and if he lease ouer the land, his will as to that intent is determined, and by consequent his estate, 22. E. 4. 5. per Brian. and his estate is such a non-estate in the eye of Law, that he cannot haue ayd of his lessor, 12. E. 4. 5. and if the heire
 accept a rent reserued vpon a lease at will made by his father, this cannot make the lease good, because it was void before, no more then his acceptance of a rent reserued vpon a lease for yeres which is determined by reentre, can make that lease good. 14. H. 8. 11.

For when communication is had about the buying of a thing, and the price is agreed vppon, and the bargaine concluded, nowe if the vendour doe at the time of the bargaine and sale adde such a condition, that if any other man within a moneth or fifteene daies next after ensuinge, will giue more

You haue put good diuersities and we haue many cases suteable vnto them in our Lawe, which I will not omit. If a man grant to one the keeping of his Parke, vpon condition that if the grauntee do not well keepe his Deare within the Parke the graunt shall be helde as no graunt: and after the grantee killeth some of the Deare, the grauntor may bring an action of trespasse3.

Barre 237. and a prouiso in an Indenture of couenants though it be placed amongst couenants, yet it shall be of force in some case wholy to defeate and dissolue the bargaine and sale, as if a man bargaine and sell a mannor with
 the aduowson in fee, habendum to the vse of the bargainee and his heires, in such ma^ner as in the Indenture of couenants is agreed, and he couenanteth to suffer a recouery to the vse expressed in the Indenture, re^dring a rent to the bargainor and his heires with a distresse for the same, and a nomine paenae, and further pro vlteriore securitate, it is concluded that the bargainor should leuie a fine to the bargainee with a rendring of the rent to the bargainor, prouiso that the bargainee shal regraunt the aduowson for life to the bargainor, and if it be couenaunted farther that all estates afterward to bee made shall bee to the said vses, now if a recouerie be suffered, and a fine leuied, but varying from the Indenture of couenants, and the bargainee dieth before the regraunt of the aduowson, the prouiso in this case is a conditio^, and for the breach of the co^dition the bargainor may enter, 14.

That where a bargaine and sale is perfite but defeasible vpo^ conditio^, the ve^dee shal take the profits till the co^dition be performed. that where the sale is perfite, but defeasible vpon co^dition, the vendee shal take the profites till the co^dition be performed, it agreeth to a case in our law, where a feofme^t is made to a feme couert of certain land, and the husba^d after disagreeth to the feofme^t, yet the mesne profits which were take^ betwixt the time of the liuery* and the disagreement, shall not be restored to the feoffor. For if a Praecipe quodreddat, had bene brought against the husband and the wife after liuerie, and the husbande had disagreed pending the writte, the writte shall abate, yet the taking of the profites is iustifiable: for the feofment made to the woman is good till the husband disagree.

In these cases, which you haue now put, our Lawe (as I take it) differeth very little, or nothing from yours: for whereas you5. That bargaines and sales, matters in writing and obligatory, may be auoyded by alleaging that they were made or done per menasse or by duresse. say, that a bargaine or sale enforced by terror may be auoyded: in our Lawe euen matters in writing and obligatory may be for the same cause defeated and frustrated: and if a man seised of an acre of lande doe giue it in taile by deed, and maketh a letter of Attourney to deliuer seisin, and al this is done by duresse of imprisonment, and liuerie of seisin is made, this is a disseisin to the donor, and the deed of gift and liuerie may by Law be auoided, 41.

But if a man grant an annuitie to an other by threatning him that he wil cary away his goods, whereupo^ he granteth vnto him the annuitie, this gra^t is not voidable by reason of such menacing, because he may haue an actio^ to recouer the goods if they be take^ away, 7.

That by the Common law a warrantie made vpo^ the concluding of a bargaine and sale doth binde, otherwise it is if the warrantie be made after the bargaine concluded.

It may bee you take the worde Treasure generally, not properly and as it is vsed strictly in our Lawe, for if a man do hide any thing in the grou^d for gaine, or through feare, or to keep it more safely, within time of memorie this may not properly haue the name of treasure, l. nunquam D. de acquir: rer. domin. for a treasure properly is, when money or things of good value haue lyen from time out of minde hidden in the ground, so that no man now hath propertie in it. d. l. nunqua^.

 which are hidden: L. 5. l. ^. D. de vsufr. ca. re. que vs. co^. and these prohibitory lawes are fortified with this penaltie, that things so hidden shall be forfeited to the Treasurie. Plato had4. Plato his superstitious opinion of thinges hidden in the earth. such a scrupulous, or rather such a superstitious conscience, that he made by his lawes treasures to be immob^les, and Dijs inferis sacros, and his precept is straunge in this case. Quae minime deposuisti, ne tollito. Plat. lib. 11. de legi. Adrianus Caesar made a law (as Spartianus reproteth) that if any man had found treasure in his owne ground, himselfe should haue it: if in an other mans, he should giue the halfe to the owner of the soyle: if in a publique place, he should deuide it equally with the treasurie.

The fourth Dialogue of Seignories and seruices.

Because things are better1. Diuision. and more certainly knowne by the definition of them, therefore I pray you let me first haue of you some definition or description of a seignorie.


Codicgn.
A seignorie, which we call feudum1. The description of a seignorie by the Ciuill law. may be thus described. A bountifull granting of land for doing homage or some other speciall seruice.

Shew me I pray you how homage2. Diuision. and other seruices had their first existence and beginning, but first shew me what homage is.


Anglonomoph.
Homage is thus performed. The1.

I become your man from this time forward of life and member, and earthly honour, and to you shall be faithfull and loyall, and shall beare vnto you faith for the tenements, which I claime to hold of you sauing the faith which I beare to our Lord the King: which being done the
 Lord sitting shall kisse him.c) Littlet. lib. 2. c. 1.


Nomom.
Hath this ceremonie beene auncient?


Codicgn.
The kneeling and giuing of a kisse2. That Homage hath bene practised in auncient times. at the doing of such seruice is very auncient: for Tiridates the King of Armenia did kneele down before Nero the Emperor, whom Nero lifted vp and gaue him a kisse. Tranquil. in Neron. And longe before his time, Alexander the great did imbrace, and with a kisse greeted such as made the like protestation of obedience and loyaltie vnto him, Plutarth. in Alexand. and long before that as it seemeth it was vsed in Iudaea, for vpo^ these words of the Psalme Psalm. 2. r. 12. (kisse the sonne) our english glosse addeth by way of interpretation (in signe of homage) and Tremellius and Iunius (in signe of fealty:) sithence these times this respectiue humiliation hath spred it selfe into other countries and territories: for the Duke of Gelderland did conceiue an oath in these words to Charles King of Fraunce: Ego deuenio vassallus ligeus Caroli regis Francorum, pro ratione quinquaginta millium scutorum auri ante festum diui Rhemigij mihi soluendorum, etc. Bodin. lib. 1. de repub. c. 9.


Nomom.
I desire greatly to know the originall3. Diuision. and first blossoming of other seignories.


Anglonomoph.
The most common seignorie of1. What a Manor is, and whereof it co^sisteth. accompt which wee haue in our Law, is a seignorie by reason of a Manor, which may be thus defined: A Manor it an inheritance of ancient continuance co^sisting of demesnes and seruices, perquisites, casualties, things appendant and regardant, customes liberties, etc.



Nomoma.
What? do so many things concurre to make a Manor: will not demesnes and seruices serue?


Anglono.
Yes, demesnes and seruices will suffice as material causes to make a Manor, 26. H. 8. 4. but it is a naked Manor which hath nothing els.


Nomom.
I would gladly heare somewhat of the commencement and first creation of a Mannor.


Anglonomo.
M. Parkins doth very well and originally2. The originall of a Manor. describe it in this manner. The originall of a Manor was when the King did giue a thousand acres of lande, or a greater or lesse parcell to one of his subiectes and his heires, to holde of him and his heyres, and the donee edifieth a house vpon this lande, as his mansion place and of 20. acres or lesse or greater, parcell, he doth enfeoffe a straunger before the Statute of Quia empto. terrar. to holde of him and of his heires as of the same house by the plowing of 10. acres of arable la^d parcell of that which remaineth in his owne possession, and enfeoffeth and other of an other parcell to hold of him by carying ordure to his arable land, and enfeoffeth a third man of a third parcell to goe with him in the warre against the Scots, and so by continuance of time (saith he) a Manor is made. Park. Reseruat. fol. 128. Sect. 670. Yet by his fauour somewhat els goeth to the making of a Manor: namely, suite of Court at his house or mansion place, 33. H. 8. Br. Comprise. 31. Mannor. 5. and this suit must be the suite of more freeholders then one (so that some doubt may be made of M. Kitchins assertion, whe^, he saith, that in some Manors there be no tena^ts but copiholders, and yet in such Mannors be Court barons Kitch. Court Leete and Baron tit. Maner^um. fol. 4.) for if all the
 freeholds do eschete vnto the Lord beside one, or if he purchase al but one the ma^nor is extinct, for it can not be a ma^nor vnlesse there be a Court baron belonging to it: and a Court baron must be helde before suitors, and not before one suitor, therfore one freehold can not make a mannor Br. Ca. Sect. 210. and 23. H. 8. Br. Court baron. 22. in fi. and 33. H. 8. Br. Suit. 17..


Nomom.
You haue well delared vnto me the4 Diuision. beginnings of Seignories and mannors: but haue there bene no lawes made for the strengthning and preseruing of the^: for me thinks they be good meanes to increase and support, the wealth, puissance, and florishing estate of the Realme.


Anglono.
Yes, our law in this case hath not either slu^berd or winked. For in the ancie^t Statute of Magna Charta it is prouided that Nullus liber homoStatutes made for the preseruation of seignoties and Mannors. det de caetero amplius de terra sua, vel ve^dat de caetero, quam vt de residuo terrae suae possit sufficienter fieri domino feodi seruitium ei debitum quod pertinet ad feodu^ illud, Magna charta. c. 31. which statute (as M. Sta^ford auoucheth,) is but a confirmation of the Co^mon law: and he (a most diligent and exquisite searcher of the reasons of Lawe, so that I may boldly speake of him, that which I shall not say impudently and vntruly, Faelix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas) sifteth out the reason of this Lawe. For saith he) if one that held by Knights seruice might haue bene suffered to haue aliened the greatest part of his land, he would haue aliened the same peraduenture to holde of him but in Socage, or by some small rent, and then hauing so little a liuelod lefte to himselfe, how had he bene able to haue done the seruice of a Knight or man of warre, or what should his Lord haue had in warde
 to haue found one to haue performed the seruice? surely little or nothing. Stamf. praerog. c. 7. tit. Alienati: sans licence. But it seemeth doubtfull notwithstanding the Statute of Magna Chart. whether the tenaunt might alien his whole tenancie or not, whereupon the Statute of Quia emptores terrarum was made, which permitted euerie free man to sell his lands or tenements, or any part therof at his pleasure to hold of the chief Lord by the same seruice, that the feoffer held, prouided alwaies that by any such sale, there come no lands to mortmain. This Statute (as M. Stamford noteth) remedieth the mischief, which was before found in the wardship, but not the other mischiefe touching the defence of the Realme, for when one mans liuing is so dismembred, neuer a one of the feoffees nor the feoffor is able to doe the seruice of a warrior for want of liuelode, there being so little quantity of land in euery of their hands, yea much more vnable sithence this statute is the feoffor then before, for before when he gaue it to hold of himselfe, he reserued somewhat in lieu of the land which went from him, whereas now he can reserue nothing of common right. Stamf. ibid. And the land which he retaineth in his owne hands may perhaps be of small value.

Seruices are diuersified according1.

Of all these seruices saue such only as haue bin before described I will speake somewhat, seuerally, briefly, and in order.
 Petite Sergeancie, is where a man holdeth his land of the King, paying yerely vnto him a Bow, or a speare, or a dagger, or a launce, or a spurre of golde etc. Littlet. lib. 2. ca. 9. sect' 1. Knights seruice in Capite, is where a man holdeth his landes or tenements of the king as of his crowne immediatly ab antiquo, by doing some warlike seruice. Graund sergeancie, is where a man holdeth his lands or tenements of the king as of his Crowne immediatly, by doing some speciall seruice to the King in person, as by carying his banner or launce, or by being his marshall, or sewer, or caruer, or butler, etc. Litt' li. 2. ca. 8. sect' 1. 23. H. 3. Gard 148 of homage and fealtie hath beene spoken before. Rent seruice, is where the tenant holdeth his lande of his Lorde by a certaine rent, for which, if it be behinde at the day, wherein it ought to be paied, the Lord may distreigne for it of common right. Burgage, is where the tenants of an auncient borough doe holde landes within the Borough of the King or some other person, as of his borough by a certaine rent. Litt' lib. 2. c. 10. sect' 1. 2. Villenage, is where a man holdeth of his Lorde, either by doing vnto him some partiticuler base seruice, and such a one is called a tenant by villenage, or by doing generally whatsoeuer base seruice his Lorde will commaund and impose vpon him, and such a tenant he is tearmed in our Law a villaine. Litt. lib. 2. c 11. sect' 1. and 2 This miserable estate of villenage, had his beginning soone after the diluge, and now by the consent of all nations it is ratified, for the West Indians though they haue3 The original of villenage and the nature thereof. no knowledge of diuine or humane Lawes, yet bondmen they haue, and the Mahometistes make
 Christians their bondeslaues, the Portugallians make villaines of the Mahometistes which they sell by companies as flockes of sheepe in the market. Bodin. lib. 1. de repub. c. 5. The Romains had power by their law to sel or kil their villains: Tacit. li. 14. but for mittigation of cruelty the Law Petronia was made, whereby it was forbidden that none should put his villaine to death without cause, which law was executed by Nero, Senec. lib. 3. de benefic. and after by Adrianus: Sparcian. in Adrian. but our law a more concionable fauorer of life hath restrained the hands of the Lord from the bloudshed of his villaine, and from the mayming of him, Lit^' lib. 2. c. 11. sect' 32. hauing regard to the Law of God which recompenseth these bondmen with freedom whom the Master hath by some blowes maymed, Exo. 21. ver. 26. and 27. which lawe Constant. the Emperor did put in practise, l. 1. de Eme^d, seruor.

 a man hold of the king as of any Honor which is come to his highnes by disce^t from any of his au^cestours, he shall not holde in Capite, for by the words in the first Chapter of Prerogatiua regis, it is euident that if it shalbe said a tenure in Capite, it must be holden of the Crowne of a long time, the words be ab antiquo de Corona, and that cannot be when it is but newly comen to the Crowne, and the statute of Magna Charta cap. 31. did (as Master Stamford saith) helpe this matter by expresse words, if such an Honor came to the Crowne by way of escheate, but not if it came by way of discent, or any other way: and that statute doth set5 Certain honors which be not of the auncientnes of the Crowne. forth certaine honours by name which be not of the auncientnes of the Crowne, that is to say, the honor of Wallingford, Notingha^, Bullingbrook, and Lancaster, therefore he that holdeth of the King as of these Honors, holdeth not of the king in chiefe, Stamfords Praerog. c. 7. but other honors there be which of so long time haue been annexed to the Crowne, that to hold of the^ is to hold in chiefe, for wheras one held of the king as of a certaine honor, to6 Some honors which are annexed to the C^owne. yeeld a certaine rent to the keeping of the Castell of Douer, this hath beene taken to be a tenure in chiefe, and so it hath been thought if one held of his highnes as of the Honour of the Abbe of Marle, Fitz. nat. bre. 256. and Anno vndecimo of king Henry the seuenth, the honor of Ralegh was annexed to the Crowne, therefore if any man hold as of that honor it is a tenure in capite, 34. H. 8. ^r. Cas. 230. and therefore there is a good rule in the Register of Writtes, that a man shall not make a fine for alienation of lands
 helde of the King as of his honor, but for lande helde in Capite onely: for there be certaine honors which be held in Capite, and there is a certain writ that the Eschetor shal not greeue any ma^ for alienation of land held as of an Honor, for that is as of an honor, and not as of the kings person, and no Fine shall be paied for the alienation of such lande, Regist' 184. Br. Alienac' 33. And whereas it was found by Office that lande was helde of the Queene as of her principalitie of Wales, by the seruice of goinge with the Prince in Warre at the charge of the Prince per Curia^. 18. Eliz. Dy. per Curiam. This is no Tenure in capite, and Master Finchden putteth this diuersity, that where an Honour is seised into the Kings handes, if a Manor held of the Honor do escheat to the king by a common Escheate, if the King alien the Manor to holde of him, the tenant shall hold by the same seruices as hee helde by before of the Honour (for the Honour seemeth to bee vice domini in this case and as a meane Lord) but if it come to the King by forfaiture of warre or by some other treaso^, or by some other cause which toucheth the Kings person, and the King seiseth, and enfeoffeth an other, the feoffee shall holde of the King as of his Crowne: 47. E. 3. 21. per Finchden. and though the Statute of Magna Charta Cap. 31. before recited doe say, Si quis tenuerit de nobis de aliqua escaeta vt de honore Wallingforde, Bolen etc. non faciet aliud seruitium quam fecit praeante: yet this is to be intended of a common Escheate and not otherwise. 19. H. 8. (...) Ca. 114. So a man may holde of the King as of his Manour, and yet not holde in Capite, for it was found by
 office that one helde land of the King, as of his Manor of Plimpton, and other landes as of his Manour of Darington, which came to the king by the attainder of treason of the Marquesse of Exetor, this hath beene thought to be no Tenure in capite, for tenures in chiefe did begin in auncient time vpon the graunts of Kings to defende them against rebelles and enemies: and at this day the Queene may create a tenure in Capite, if shee giue lande to holde of her person: otherwise it is if it be giuen to hold of an Honor, Manour, etc. for a Tenure in chiefe must be immediatly of the King, and is created by the King onely: for a tenure created by a subiect cannot be a tenure in chiefe, nor haue any prerogatiue annexed vnto it, and if the tenants of an Honour should holde of the King in Capite, the Honour when it came to the King should bee destroyed, which may not be, and there is no reason that the tenant in whom there is no default should be preiudiced in his tenancie by the offence of the Lorde, 30. H. 8. 44. Dyer. and if the Q. purchase a Manour of which I. S. holdeth by knights seruice, the tenant shall holde as he helde before, and he needeth not to tender his liuerie, nor primer seisin: for he doth not hold in Capite, but as of a Manour, and if his heire be in ward by reason thereof he may haue an Ouster le maine at his ful age, and if the Queene graunt the Manour afterward to W. N. in fee, excepting the seruices of I. S. now I. S. holdeth of the Queene as of her highnesse person: yet hee shall not holde in Capite
 but by such seruices as he helde by before of the Manor: for the Queenes acte may not preiudice her tenant, 29. H. 8. Br.

Codicgn.
To dissolue that question a difference is to be taken, for either the Father of the heire

Aqu. l. qua actione, @. si quis in colluctatione. which the best and most learned of all Poets did well imagine: who when he had placed Caesar in the middest of extreme troubles, to comforte and encourage him, representeth vnto him the ghost of Scaeua, one that dyed a good while before, but yet after many assaults and many wou^ds stoode out as a Conqueror, Lucan. li. 10. which conceite of Lucan, Tasso a moderne Italian writer, a man of an excellent poeticall witte in the discriptyon of Guidoes funerall doth passionatelye though Popishely glaunce at, S.

There be many conclusions in our3 Some cause of forfaiture at the common Law. Lawe aunswerable to that which you haue said, for it hath bin affirmed, that if a man holde his land of his Lord by homage and fealtie, and he hath done homage and fealtie to his Lorde, and the Lorde hath issue a sonne and dyeth, and the seignorie discendeth to the sonne, in this case the tenaunt which hath done homage to the father shal not do homage to the sonne, because when a tenaunt hath once done homage to his Lorde hee is excused for tearme of lyfe to doe homage to any other heire of the Lord, Litt' lib. 2. c. 7. sect 13. But if a man bee seised of a Mannour, and an other man holdeth lande of him as of the foresayde Mannour by homage, and hath done his homage vnto him, and a straunger bringeth a Precipe quod reddat against the owner of the Mannour, and recouereth the Mannour against him, and sueth execution, in this case the tenaunt shall agayne doe homage to him that recouered the Mannour, though he haue done homage before, because the estate of him who receiued the first homage is defeated by the recouerie, and it lyeth not in the mouthe of the tenaunt to falsifye or defeate the recouerie which was against his Lorde. Litt' ibid' sect' 17. And if if a tenaunt which ought by his tenure to doe homage to his Lorde come to his Lorde and say vnto him, that hee is readie to doe him homage for the tenements which hee holdeth of him, and the Lorde doth then refuse to receiue it, after such refusall the Lord cannot distreigne
 the tenaunt for the homage, before the Lorde require him to doe homage vnto him and he refuseth, Litt' lib. 2. c. 7. sect' 19. 20. and he that holdeth by Knights seruice of the King, neede not goe to warre with him, if hee will finde a sufficient person conueniently armed, and fitte to goe with the King, and this seemeth good reason: For it may bee, that hee that holdeth by such seruices doth languishe in sickenesse, so that he cannot goe, nor ryde: And a Feme sole which holdeth by such seruices may not in such case goe in proper person, and it hath beene said, that Escuage shall not bee graunted vnlesse the King goe to warre himselfe in proper person, and after such a voyage royall it hath beene likewise affirmed, that by authoritie of Parliament Escuage shall be assessed and put in certaine how much euery one that holdeth by an entier fee of Knightes seruice, which was not with the King by himselfe or by an other for him, shall pay to his Lord of whom he holdeth by Escuage, as if it be ordeigned by authoritie of Parliament that euery one which holdeth by an entier fee of Knights seruice that was not with the King nor any other etc. for him shall pay to his Lord fortie shillinges, then euery one that holdeth of his Lord by the moitie of a Knights fee, shall pay to his Lorde fortie shillinges, and he that holdeth by a fourth parte tenne shillinges, and soe pro rata.

 in case of felonie, for in case of treason the King shall bee presently after the attainder in actuall possession without office founde by the statute of 33.

 medicine and not in fourme of a penaltie: and as it hath the effect of a punishment euerie one is punished for his owne fault onely: but as it hath the effect of a medicine, so one man is punished for an others fault, that by suffering shame hee may be deterred from crime) yet here it may be said what place is there left for innocencie if the most guiltles may be punished for the misdemeanor of the most guiltie, for as it is not the fault of the corne that it groweth in a badde soile, so it is not the fault of the sonnes that they are begotten of lewde fathers, therfore it may seeme meet and expedient that there should be ibi paena, vbi culpa and that offences should rest vpon the authors, and that the falle shoulde goe no further then the fault, and there is a Law in Deutronom.

By our Law there must bee the expresse2. That by the Common law the word Excambium must be vsed in the exchaunge. word of exchau^ge me^tioned, otherwise a thing ca^ not be said to passe by exchau^ge, for the word excambiu^ only maketh an exchau^ge, as the words liberu^maritagiu^ onely doe make frankmariage:
 for if I giue to one an acre of land by deed indented, and he by the same deed giueth to me an other acre for this acre, nothing passeth except liuerie be made, and then the liuerie onely transferreth the land: otherwise it had beene if the word (exchaunge) had beene vsed in the deede, and the estate which the parties are to haue in the land exchaunged ought to be equal:3. That the estates most be equall. and Choke saith that both the things exchanged ought to be in esse at the time of the exchaunge, and therefore an exchange of land for rent granted de nouo is not good, but an exchaunge betwixt4. That the things exchau^ged must be in Esse. a rent and a common which are in esse at the time of the exchaunge is good, and so it is of land and rent: 9. E. 4. 21. p Brian, Choke, and Nedham. And according to his opinion an exchange of the right which the dissesee hath to the land wherof the disseisin is committed, for an acre of land in which the disseisor hath right is no good exchaunge: 3. E. 4. 10. p Choke. And where the worde (exchaunge) is mentioned, though the conueyance be but an Indenture of couenants, yet it shall amount to a good exchaunge: for an Indenture of couenants was made betwixt a Prior and the Maister of Gunnell hall in Cambridge that the Maister should haue three acres of land to him and to his successors, in perpetuall exchaunge for one chamber of two chambers to be assigned by the said Maister at his election to the said Prior and his successors, this hath beene held to be a good exchaunge, though it be by way of couenant: 9. E. 4. 38. And though it be auouched for lawe, that if by a deed of composition
 it be agreed betwixt two, that the one shall haue such landes in allowance of other lands belonging to him, that this is a good exchaunge: 3. E. 3. 19. yet I doubt whether an exchange may be acco^plished by such counteruaileable words: but a man may5. That an exchaunge is good, though the one parte of it doe mure by way of extinguishment. giue land in excha^ge for a release which cannot mure but only by way of extinguishme^t, though there be some authoritie against it, 7. E. 3. 37. and therefore Nortons opinio^ is iustly denied by Thorpe, wheras he held that in euery exchau^ge there must be a mutuall transmutation of the possession, 16. E. 3. Exchaunge 2. for if a man release to an other his estouer of wood, which he is to take yeerely in his wood, in exchaunge for land giuen to him in exchaunge for the same release, this is a good exchange though the release take effect by way of extinguishme^t: but it is as great a profite and aduauntage to the tenant to be discharged of the estouers, as if so much had bene graunted vnto him out of an other mans wood, Park. tit. Exchaun. 53. 31. E. 1.

The reason in our Lawe3. That by the Common law Ecclesiasticall persons their patrons and ordinaries ioyning together can not make any good exchange of Ecclesiasticall benefices. wherefore such ecclesiasticall persons, nor their patrons and ordinaries, though they all agree can not exchaunge the inheritances of spirituall liuings, is because the statute, strictly prouideth that no alienation be made in mortmaine: for a thing which was amortised before, may be again amortised, and therefore if a religious person do appropriate a Church which is of his owne presentation without the kings licence, it is forfeited though it were amortised before, 19. E. 3. Mortmain. 8. and in such case where one Abbot did alien to an other, the collusion was to bee enquired of, as well as in the alienation of land made by a secular man to a religious corporation, 16. Assis. pl. 1. for the wordes of the Statute of Mortmaine bee very4. That the statute of Mortmain is most strict and pregnant in wordes. strong and large against such purchasors, which are thus: Prouisum est quod nullus religiosus emere, vel sub colore donationis, aut termini, aut alterius tituli cuiuscunque ab aliquo recipere, aut arte vel ingenio sibi appropriare praesumat, per quod terrae, and tenementa huiusmodi ad manum mortuam quocunque modo deueniant, Statut. de religios. 7. E. 1. Mortmain. 3. and therefore the case was,
 that a femme sole purchased lande in fee, and tooke to husba^d the villaine of a Bishop, which he had in right of his Bishoprike, and the Bishop entred and this was adiudged a mortmain, for according to Wickinghams opinio^ the words of the Statute of Mortmaine are quocunque modo: otherwise it shall be if the tenant of the Bishop do die without heire, 41. E. 3. 21. but 19. Henr. 6. the contrarie is held to be Lawe, but if the villaine himselfe purchase lande, it is helde there that in such case a Bishop or an Abbot can not enter, 19. H. 6. 56. but Thorpes opinion is 41. E. 3. that though hee may not enter in the case aforesaid, yet hee may reteigne the land against the villaine, and the king may afterward ratifie his estate, which is no more in plaine tearmes, then that an estate so gained is voidable onely and not voide, and as to the exchaunge of benefices betwixt parson and parson it is seuerely punished by edict of Parliament in our realme. 31.

The Seuenth Dialogue. Of Deuises and Legacies.

Codicgn.
It is very auncient, for it was one1. The antiquity of willes. of the Lawes of the twelfe Tables, Vti legassit, suae rei ita ius esto, L. verbis legis ff. de verb. signif. But before Solons time it was not lawfull for a man to deuise his goods Extra familiam, to straungers: and therefore, when Solon did by Lawe established, graunt this libertie to the Athenians, it was plausibly receiued of them, and accompted the best of all his Lawes. Plutarch. in Solon. But Plato in his writings straungely,2. Plato his exception against Solon his Law concerning willes. howsoeuer diuinely conceited, dispraiseth this Lawe, and calleth the makers of it childish, because by that meane, a window is opened to deceite, and to flatterie: for hee saith, that when men are at point of death, they beginne to dote, and their vnderstanding is broken, and therefore it is very likely, that euery man dying will dispose and appoint many thinges contrarie to the Lawe, to the vsuall practise of them that liue, and to the example of their ancestors. Plat. lib. 11. de legib. This sentence of Plato, Iustinian an Emperour exquisitely busied in the compiling of Lawes, because hee had rather erre with Plato, then
 yeelde vnto the truth with Solon, alloweth, and frameth his Lawes accordingly, Authent. de trient: and sem. in l. Paulus ad Treb. and S. Ierom writeth, that Solons Lawe was repealed in his time, because Priestes which were commonly employed in the making of willes, did greedily and odiously drawe to themselfes, the inheritance of the dead: L. 1. C. de sacr: Eccles. and an other reason may be added in defence of Platoes opinion: because men in daunger of death are for the most parte too prodigall, which Aristotle noted, Diogen. Laerti. in vit. Aristotel. and Tacitus pronounceth more peremptorily speaking of Otho, Tacit. lib. 2. lustor. Pecunias distributt parce, nec tanquam periturus, hauing affirmed before, Difficilius est temperare, qua te non putes diu vsurum. But Solons3. Solons lawe is mainteined and defended against Plato. Lawe leaneth to a more stable roote, then that it may bee shaken by the weake blaste of such colourable reprehensions: and Solon did make exceptions to his Lawe for hee made these testaments voide which were made by any in the extremitie of his disease, or which a man was enforced to make by imprisonment or torment, or by the perswasions and flatterie of his wife: But surely the making of willes is necessarie, L. 3. D. qui test. fa. pos. and without it men can not effect the good education and bringing vp of their children, nor be able of their proper goodes, chattels and other mooueable substaunce to discharge their dettes, and after their degrees set foorth and aduance their children and posteritie. 32.

Likewise a man deuised, that after the death of his wife, his land should be sold by his executors together with the assent of A. and maketh his wife, and a stranger his executors and dieth: the wife dieth, A. dieth, the authoritie of selling the land is fully determined and gone: 5. Eliz. 219. Dy. and so it was held per curiam, that if a man did declare his will, that B. and C. his executors should sell his land and the testator dieth and B. dieth: and C. maketh M. his executor and dieth, and M. selleth it, this sale is void, for the trust is strict: but M. Brudnell saith that if a man deuise by his will that H. and N. his executors shall sell his land, and they refuse to be executors, yet they may sell the land, because they are named by their proper names: 19. H. 8. 9. But where the executors are not specially named for the sale of the land, there one of them onely may well enough sell the land: for the case was, that a man did deuise all his lands to his sister, except one manor, which he appointed to pay his debts, and he made two executors and died, the one executor died, yet the other may sell the mannor and pay the debts per intentionem testatoris, the words of the deuise as touching the sale were generall (which I appointe to pay my debts). 23.

What if the testator doe deuise to his16. Diuision.

Canonolog.
I thinke it is not determined, for1. That by the Cannon lawe if land be deuised to a woman whilest she shall liue chastly, mariage is not implicatiuely and absolutely prohibited. though the words of the deuise do implie a co^dition, yet the condition is not broken, because matrimonium est reshonesta, and therefore not to be imagined to be within the intent of the condition.

Canonol.
But I thinke rather that she shal not lose the legacie, because there was no condition expressed in the deuise that shee should not marrie, and therefore she can not be said in marying to do against the will of her husband: but yet it may seeme, that if she had maried within a yeare after the death of the testator, she had broke the condition, ff. de iur. patron: l. adigere @. fi. for doubtles otherwise, Mulier secundo nubeus castitatem seruat.

Let this be the case: the husba^d deuiseth17. Diuision. to his wife the profits of al his goods, the question is whether the wife may take the profits by her sole authoritie, or by the appointment of the iudge, or by the administration of the executor.1. That there is a diuersitie, in the Ciuill lawe where a man maketh his wife vsufructuariam of his goods, and where he deuiseth them to her.


Codicgn.
In our law we take this difference: where he maketh his wife by his will vsufructuariam of the goods, and where he doth deuise vnto her his goods: For where he maketh her vsufructuariam, she may of her owne power take the profit and benefit of the goods, and she needeth not to expect or attend the curtisie of the executor: L. si habitatio @. si vsus fu^di. and l. fundi ff: de vsu and hab: But if he deuise his goods, or the profits of his goods, or commaund and charge his heire or executor by his will, that they allow sufficient maintenaunce to his wife out of his lands or goods, now the woman is a deuisee, and she must take that which is deuised, by the ha^ds of the heire or executor, or else sue for it by law. ff. de vsuf^uct: legat. l. patrimonij and l. si quis.

By our law the power and authoritie2.

H. 6. 30. ^ Prisot. 2. H. 6 16. Perkins Testam. 94. D. S. Dialog. 2. 79. And therefore if a straunger take goods deuised to me out of the possession of the executors, I cannot haue an action of trespasse for the taking: For it is not like to a gift of goods which is presently executed: and if a man deuise the ^ourth part of his goods to another, the deuisee may not seise the fourth part but he must sue for it in the spiritual court, 27. H. 6. but if a man deuise a booke or some other thing to
 one for tearme of life, the remainder to an other for euer, if the executor deliuer the booke or the goods to the first deuisee, the second deuisee may seise the^ without liuerie of the executor, for the possessio^ of the first deuisee was the possessio^ of the^ both, otherwise it is if the first deuisee hath the possessio^ and die 37. H. 6. 30.: but if a man seise in an other right then as deuisee, then he neede not depend vpon the deliuerie of the executors: and therefore the case was 9. E. 4. that an action of dette was brought against one as executor in London, and the defendant said that the testator did giue vnto him certaine goods by his deed, and he shewed in particular what goods they were, the testator being at the time of the gift in the village of B. in the countie of Essex, and that he suffered the goods to be in the possess. of the testator vntill his death at London, and after the death of the testator he tooke the^, absque hoc that he did administer as executor: and the whole Court helde that the Iurors ought to find this matter of the gift of the goods vpo^ paine of attaint 9. E. 4. 40., but where a man ought to take a thing by the deliuery of an other, and he taketh it of his owne head, he is a trespassor: and therefore if a man grau^t to an other an estouer of wood to be taken by the view, and deliuery of his Bailie, if hee take it without the deliuerie of the Bailie, the grauntor may haue an action of trespasse against him, Quare vi and armis 8.

From this diuersitie our Lawe2.

An vsurous lending or lending of money for interest, is by way of obiection mainteined. naturall reason, because reason enforceth and nature moueth vs to this, that wee should doe well to them that haue done well to vs, otherwise wee might incurre the sault of ingratitude, which drieth vp the verie fountaine of liberalitie, and besides by the Lawe of nature it is lawfull for euery one to lende of his owne as he list, and to receiue for his owne as it pleaseth him: and it seemeth to bee permitted by the Lawe of God when it is said: Ego veniens cum vsuris exegissem illud, Luc: 19. and so it is appointed in Deuteronom. Faeneraberis gentibus multis, Deuter. 29. And hereto agreeth the opinion of Aquinas, who writing vpon Ecclesiast.2. Aquinas his authoritie is vrg^d for proofe h^reof. saith thus: Faenerare proximo tuo in tempore necessitatis illius: And againe: Redde proximo tuo in tempore suo. Multi quasi inuentionem aestimauerunt faenus and praestiterunt molestiam suis qui se adiuuerunt. Donec accipiat osculatur dantis manum, and in promissionibus humiliat vocem suam, and in tempore redditionis postulabit tempus, and loquetur verba taedij and murmurationum, and tempus causabitur Aquin. in Ecclesiast c. 29.: And surely me thinkes it is a point of brotherly loue to lende vnto a needy brother a competent summe of monie, so much as will serue him for a reasonable surplusage of increase.



Cononol.
Vsurie may well be called the diuels3 The obiection is aunswered by the Comonist. charitie: for as the diuell cannot doe any good howsoeuer he would seeme to doe it, because it is against his nature to doe any good thing: so his charitie howoseuer it may seeme to doe good, yet in truth cannot performe any good thing, because the nature of it is opposite to all goodnesse being by Cato resembled to murder, by the Canon law to theft: Ca: si quis vsuram: l. 4. q. 4. yet it maketh some show to doe good, but so as if a man were troubled with a burning ague, and greatly inflamed in his bodie, shoulde in the extremitie of his heate aske a cuppe of single beare of one that standeth by, and hee reacheth it vnto him this cooleth the heate for a time, and the sicke man thanketh him for it, but when the disease doth reuerte vpon him and his fittes growe worse then they were before, and he perceiueth that the drinke which he drunke hath two much inflamed him, then he beginneth to complaine of the hurtfull curtesie and pitie of the other man: so when the vsurer lendeth mony at the first he that boroweth it thanketh him, and thinketh himselfe deepely beholden to him, but in the ende when he findeth that his goods decrease and his debts increase by the vsurers kindnes, when not onely potte and panne, but euen garments and iewels must be either gaged or sold to satisfie the vsurer, and whe^ they perceiue the Bee that had a flower in her mouth to haue a stinge in her taile, then (that is to say) too late they finde that vnder this baite lyeth a hooke, vnder this charitie crueltie. And as to Aquinas his opinion


 of this matter quis tumidum guttur miretur in4 Aquinas his authority disproued. Alpibus? and who will wonder if Aquinas patronize an errour in diuinitie? yet he defendeth it straungely for he holdeth in the very same place, that it is prohibted by the Law of God, and yet that it maybe tollerated in a politik respect, is not this Theomachein? is not this to permit vnto flesh and bloud, which the spirit of God hath forbidden, but to aunswere you more particularly: First vsury is against the lawe of nature, because it is against the Law of nature that money should ingender money, and against the Lawe of God, in which it is said: Si pecuniam mutuo dederis pupillo meo pauperi, non vrgebis eum quasi exactor nec vsuris opprimes, Exod. 22. and againe mutuum date, nihil inde sperantes, and by our law it is flatly forbidden. 14. quest: 4. ca. 1. cum sequent: and in Clem. 1. de vsur.

The change of money may happen two waies, for either it may be changed in respect of the matter, wherof it is made, as if in stead of siluer, brasse-coine be vsed, or in stead of gold, siluer: for the auncient Germanes, as Tacitus reporteth, had siluer in greater price then golde, Tacit: de moribus Germanor: and in Pisana siluer money is of more accompt then golde, because the people of that countrie doe pay many tributes and taxes to the Pope, whose collectors and officers will not take any payment in gold, in Sparta yron-money was onely in vse, Polyb. lib. 6. Plutarch. in Lych. or els it may be changed in the value, as if a Floren, which was worth 4. li. to be debased to 3. li. for in the value of money, neither the matter nor forme is respected, but the determination1 A diuersitie in the Ciuil law when money is tendered at the day of payment* and is after embased, and when it is tendered after. of the Prince, wherefore Aristotle said wel, that mony is not ce^sured by nature but by law, and is of such value, as the law published of it doth determine, Aristot: lib. 5.

The ninth Dialogue of the bailement or deliuerie of goods and Chattelles.

NOmomat.
It remaineth now by the order of your conference, that you shoulde speake of the baylement and deliuerie of goods and chattels, in which I would haue you to be verie briefe, because I had rather be resolued in other matters belonging to the next title,
 whereof yeare to treate, wherein I shall stande in neede of more instructions* but because some doubtes touching the aforesaid title doe trouble me, ye shall giue me leaue to moue vnto ye some two or three questions thereupon, what is that Codicgn. which in the Ciuil law ye doe properly call depositum? for I doe imagine that the true1. Diuision. knowledge thereof will ease my minde of many doubtes.


Codicgn.
Depositum, is that which is committed1 The definition of depositum by the ciuil law. to the credit and faithfulnesse of a man, to keepe safely to the vse of him that deliuereth it, to the ende that it may be restored, when he shal call for it, l. 1. ff. depos. vbi doct', and in l. quod ^eruus eod: and dict: l. 1. @. est autem: and @. penult. and l.

Angonomoph.
To this our Law accordeth, for2 The nature and course of it at the common law. if a man deliuer goods and chattels to one to keepe and he will deliuer them, he that deliuered them may haue a writ of Detinue against the other for these goods and chattels, and so if a man deliuer goods or mony to an other in a bagge ensealed, Fitz. na. br. 138. A. or not ensealed, 18. H. 6. 20. or in a chest, or coffer, to deliuer to an other and hee to whom they are deliuered will not deliuer them ouer accordingly, hee to whom they should bee deliuered, may haue a writ of Detinue, but if a man deliuer money to one being not in a bagge or coffer, to redeliuer to him, or to deliuer ouer to a straunger, in such case, neither he that deliuereth, nor he to whom the money, or goods are to bee deliuered, shall haue a writte of Detinue for the money, but a writte of Accompt, because a writte of Detinue
 ought to be of a thing certaine, as of money in a3 A diuersiti^ where a writ of Accompt, of Detinue, and of Trespas are to be brought concerning things deliuered at the co^mon law. bagge, or of a horse, or twentie kyne, or such things in certaine, Fitz na. br. 138.

E. 4. 36. or if he doe burne or consume the things deliuered vnto him, 33. H. 6. 26. per Litt' 20. H. 6. 17. So where a deed is deliuered to one to deliuer ouer vpon a condition to be performed to a straunger, and hee deliuereth it without mencioning the condition, a writ of Detinue will lye against the first Bailie, and no other remedy may be had, 9. H. 6. 37. per Curiam. and where I deliuer goods, and a straunger taketh them out of the possession of the Bailie, I may haue a writ of Detinue against the straunger, or against my Bailie, 20. E. 4. 11. for my Bailie is chargable into whose ha^ds soeuer the goods do come: but if he deliuer them ouer to an other, that baily is not chargeable to me, but onely for the possession. 12.

They cannot be said to be deposita in1 That a thing cannot be said to be a depositum at the ciuil law, except it be deliuered to the partie. his hands, because a thing cannot be said to be depositu^, except it be deliuered to the partie, l. 1. ff. de pos. and ibi Doct'. and
 if these writings, which you speake of, do belong to the feoffor, as I thinke they doe, then they cannot be said to be deposita: for wee haue a rule in our law, that res propriae frustra deponuntur apud dominum cum ex deposito non obligetur, and it is contral) quirem: eod: bona^ fidem that the owner should redeliuer his goods in which he hath a propertie to an other man. l. bona fides ff: depos. in s^:

It is good to be considered to2 That by the common law the feoffee of the land is to haue the charters when the feoffement is without warrantie: otherwise it is, when it is with warrantie. whom these charters or deedes aboue mencioned doe belong. The authority is very pregnant, that if a man make a feoffement of his land to an other by deede, the feoffee shall haue the charters concerning the land, though the feoffor doe not expresly giue them to the feoffee. 18. E. 4. 14. 9. E. 4. 53. 39. E. 3. 22. 7. H. 4. 7. 34. H. 6. 1. And if a man make a lease for terme of yeares, and after confirme the estate of the lessee in fee, and he to whom the confirmation was made dyeth, now his heire shall haue as well the deed of the lease for terme of yeares, as well as the deed of confirmation, because that deed maketh the confirmation good, 9. E. 4. 53. Fitz. nat. br. 138. K. and so where a gift is made to one for life, the remainder to an other in taile, if the donor release all his right to the tenant for life, he in the remainder cannot haue a writte of Detinue for this release after the death of the tenaunt for terme of life: 9. H. 6. 54. But in the case which you haue proposed, because the feoffement is with warrantie, so that the feoffour is bounde to warrantie, nowe the feoffee shall not haue the charters concerning the lande, for so the feoffour might sayle of the
 maintenance of his warrantie, and so if a man be enfeoffed with warrantie and after enfeoffeth an other with warrantie, the heire of the feoffour may haue a writte of Detinue against a straunger in whose possession are any deedes or charters concerning the lande, because he may haue aduauntage of this warrantie, Fitz. na. br. ibid' L. but let the feoffement or gift bee made without warrantie, it is cleare that the donee or feoffee may claime the charters concerning the inheritance de iure, and therefore if a gift of lande be made to A. in taile the remainder to B. in fee, and after A. dyeth without issue, B. shall haue the deede, 3. H. 7. 15. so if la^ds be giuen to two, and the heires of one of them by deede, now if the tenant for life die hee that hath the fee simple shall haue a writte of Detinue for the deede, Fitz. nat. br. 138. F. for the deede runneth with the land and is of the nature of the inheritance, and therefore a repleuin lyeth not for such charters, 4. H. 7. 10. and it is saide by Newton 22. H. 6. that he in the remainder in taile shall not haue a writte of Detinue against the tenant for terme of life, if he haue the deed specifying the remainder, yet he cannot haue a Formed on in the remainder, nor an action of Waste without shewing the deede. 22.

The tenth Dialogue of the forme of ordinarie proceeding in matters of Law.

NOmomat.
It remaineth Codicgn. that1. Diuision. ye should now speak of the forme and manner of ordinarie proceeding in matters of Lawe, which because it dependeth wholy vpon the practise and custome of Courts, in which I haue imployed no great trauaile, nor obseruance, I must therefore request you to stretche your sinewes in this regarde, and not onely to argue, but open things vnto me, and be not angrie with me, if in the handeling of these matters I bring ye from the hil, that is your high and intricate pointes, to the valley or plaine, that is to matters more plaine and easie, and againe from the valley to the hill, when I finde in my selfe strengthe of vnderstandinge to ascende. First I pray you shew vnto me what is to bee done at the commencement or beginning of a suit or action.


Codicgn.
Because in euery controuersie of law,1 The things which are to be obserued of the plaintife at the beginning of a suit by the Ciuil law. there must be a plaintife and a defendant, it is not amisse nor impertinent to mention such thinges as ought to be obserued and regarded of the plaintife, when he draweth any man into suit: and they are three in number, the one concerning profit, the other necessitie, and the third vrbanitie. It is a point of profit or warinesse for the plaintife
 before he commence suit against any, to be well aduised and assured whether himselfe be a lawfull person to stande in iudgement, and to demaunde that which he bringeth into question, l. 1. C. qui legit: person: standi in iud: hab: he ought likewise to be sure that he haue a good cause of controuersie, or els in some cases hee must be adiudged to pay the costes to the defendant: in other some he must beare the losse of the charges of the suit, l. eum quem temere ff. de iudicijs. likewise he ought to beware, least he draw the defendant before an incompetent Iudge. 2. It is a point of necessitie that the partie whom the plaintife sueth, be cited, or summoned before: for against the partie not summoned, nor heard, nothing can bee determined, l. de vnoquo. que ff. de re: iud: etc. 1. exc. de caus. poss. and proprietat: Citation (as we say) is parcell or the2 Citation is proued to be of the substa^ce of the proceeding, contrary to the opinion of some ciuilians. Lawe of nature, Clem: pastoralis de re iud: therefore of necessitie the partie defendant must be summoned, because in euerie action the iudgement hath a retrospect to the originall, and to the summons, and as we say in plaine tearmes to that part of the action which is de in ius vocando: Ext. de procurat: C. in nostra in sin: and l. prolatam C. de sent: and interloq: om: iud. otherwise the iudgeme^t is erronious, Iusti: de offic: iud: in princ: and in @. omnem in authen: delitigios.

These cautels which your Law3 The cautch to be obserued at the commo^ law in the co^mencement of an action. prescribeth to such as enter into suit, ar not vtterly reiected of our law, for as to the 2. first which concerne profit and necessitie, our law doth rigorously exact them: as to the other it is not against it, for it doth not forbid, nor hinder any man to be curteouse to an other, but it being a science rather politike then morall, doth more respect the Iustice of causes, then the curteous gestures of men, our law doth vrge men to deale well and honestly, and if they do otherwise it doth punish the^, but curtesy is a free, spontaneal and ingenious quality, to which no inforcement may be vsed, but I wil first examine by your patience, how farreforth our law regardeth the abilitie of the person, which is to impleade an other, and then by course will examine all the partes of your precedent speech, inquiring by our bookes howe they may sort, and be sutable to our law. First it hath beene receiued of vs as a currant
 rule from all antiquitie, that the desendant may4 Disableme^ts in the person of the plaintife at the comon Law. plead outlawrie in disablement of the plaintife, but if he doe imparle nowe he cannot plead outlawrie to the disablement of his person, but yet he may well plead it in barre of the action, 32. H. 6. 32. 35. H. 6. 36. so in a writ brought by one as sonne and heire to I. S. after imparlance the tenant cannot pleade to the writte that hee is bastarde, or that hee is not heire, but he may verie well pleade it in barre of the action, 22. E. 4. 35. and so outlawrie is a good plea in barre of an action of debt: for by the outlawrie of the plaintife, the debt if it growe by especialtie is vested in the Queene, otherwise it is of an action of debt vpon a contract: 16. E. 4. 4. for in that case the debtor might wage his lawe against the debtee who is outlawed, and as it seemeth by 10. Hen. 7. the outlawrie goeth rather in barre of the action, then to the writte, for there it is sayde, that where a man cannot pleade to the writte, but by shewing of a matter in barre, there he may shewe it and conclude to the writte: for in an action of debt a man may pleade outlawrie in the plaintife, and conclude to the person, and yet the matter goeth in barre, and he may pleade it also in barre, 10. H. 7. 11. and conclude to the action, and after that a voucher is counterpleaded, and the tenant put to an other aunswere, hee may notwithstanding plead that the demaundant is outlawed, 21. E. 4. 64. but after voucher the tenant may not plead to the fourme of the writte, 5. E. 3. 223. and 32. Hen. 6. is verie playne, that where a man pleadeth that the plaintife is
 an alien borne, or a villaine, or an outlawed person it is left to his choise, whether he will conclude these special matters to the writte or to the action, 32. H. 6. 27. and though the defendant haue made an attourney in a repleuin, yet he may afterward alleadge that the plaintife is his villaine, 29. E. 3. 24. So 21. R. 2. in Assise brought by the husbande and wife against diuerse persons, the tenantes sayde that the wife of the plaintife was entred into religion in the house of B. and there was a Nun professed, and demaunded iudgment if she should be aunswered, and the Assise was adiorned into the common place, and a writte was sent to the Bishoppe to certifie, who certified that she was professed, wherefore the defendants praied that the husband and wife might be barred foreuer, and it was helde by the whole Court, that forsomuch as the pea did stretche onely to disable the wife of the plaintife, and if the husbande and wife had purchase iointly, that the baron should notwithstanding the disablement haue an Assise of the whole, but otherwise it is if the husbande and wife bring an Assise, and a feoffement or release of the husbande or the wife or of some auncestour of one of them bee pleaded in barre, both of them shall be barred, therefore in this case it was helde that the iudgement ought not to be that the husbande should be barred, but by the aduise of the whole Court it was awarded that the husbande and the wife nihil capiant per breue suum, sed essent in misericordia. 21. R. 2. Judgem^t 263. and in the thirde yeare of Henry the
 sixth it was held a good plea to say that the demandant was an alien borne in Portugall, which is out of the Kings legeance with conclusion, sil serra respondu. 3. H. 6. 11. and therefore Master Theloall in his Digest of writtes well obserueth, that an exception taken to a writ propter defectum nationis, vel potius defectum subiectionis, vel ligeantiae is peremptorie, and that the action can not bee reuiued by peace, or league subsequent, and that the King may graunt lycence to aliens to impleade, and likewise that such aliens as come into the Realme by the Kinges licence and safe conduite may vse personall actions by writte, though they bee not made denizens, and that denizens lawfully made by the Kinges graunt, and such aliens borne which are within the expresse wordes of the statute of 25. of Edward the thirde, may vse actions reall by originalll writte, Thelo: Digest de briefes lib. 1. ca. 6. And where a man is excommunicated, and hee sueth an action reall or personall, the tenant or defendant may pleade that the plaintife is excommunicated, and hereof he ought to shewe the Bishoppes letters vnder his seale testifying the excommunication, and then he may demaunde iudgement whether he ought to bee aunswered, Litt' lib. 2. ca. 11. sect' 42. but if the demaundant or plaintife cannot denie this, the writ shal not abate, but the iudgement shalbe that the tenant or def. shall go quite without day: because when the demanda^t, or plaintife hath purchased letters of absolution, and they are shewed forth to the Court, he may haue a resummons or reattachement vpon his originall
 according to the nature of his writte, Litt' ibid. and whereas you say, that it behoueth the plaintife to be sure that he haue a good cause of action least he pay the costes, that now by statute is made common Law, for by the statute of 23. H.5 The statute of 23. H. 8. of giuing damages to the defendant is co^pared with the rule of the ciuil Law. 8. it is enacted that if any person or persons, commence or sue in any Court of Recorde, or elsewhere, in any other Court, any action, bille, or plaint of trespasse vpon the statute of King Richarde the seconde, made in the fifthe yeare of his raigne for Entries into landes or tenements where no entrie is giuen by the Law, or any action, bill, or plaint of debt or couenant vpon any especialtie made to the plaintife or plaintifes, or vpon any contract supposed to be made between the plaintife or plaintifes, and any person or persons, or any action, bill, or plaint of detinue of any goods or chattels where the plaintife or plaintifes shall suppose that the propertie belongeth to them or any of them, or any action, bill, or plaint of Accompt, in the which the plaintife or plaintifes suppose the defendant or defendants to be their Bailife, or Bailifes, receiuer or receiuers of their Manor, mease, money or goods to yeeld accompt, or any action, bill, or plaint vpon the case, or vpon any statute for any offence or wronge personal, immediatly supposed to be done to the plaintife or plaintifs, and the plaintife or plaintifes in any such kind of action, bill or plaint after appearance of the defendant or defendants be nonsuted, or that any verdict happen to passe by lawfull trial against the plaintife
 or plaintifes in any such action, bill, or plaint: that then the defendant or defendants in euerie such action, bill or plaint, shall haue iudgement to recouer his costes against euerie such plaintife or plaintifes 23. H. 8. c. 15. Rast. Dammages 6.. Likewise whereas as you saie, that the partie plaintife ought to be warie, least hee6. Suite must not be mainteined before an incompetent iudge according to the common law. cause the defendant to appeare before an inco^petent iudge, that agreeth fullie with the common lawe, for if a man doe sweare vnto me that he will enfeoffe me of such land before such a daie, if he do not enfeoffe me, I may not sue him in the Ecclesiasticall Court Pro laesione fidei, because the acte which is to be done, is a temporal acte and ought to be tried by the Common law, and therefore if the partie be sued in the Ecclesiasticall Court for it, he may haue a prohibition Fitzh.

Yee haue spent a great deale of2. Diuision. time in treating of the commencement or beginning of a suit or action: yet I desire to haue some further knowledge of the nature of a citation or summons, therefore resolue mee, when a man is summoned to appeare within two or three daies after such a returne, whether shall the second or third daie be accompted in the citation, so that then he that is cited may well enough appeare, when as in the one case one daie is past, so that he doth not appeare within the two daies appearing first in the morning of the second daie: in the other case two daies be past, so that he appearing the third daie doth not appeare within the three daies so that if he will saue his default, me thinketh he should appeare the first day of al.

This question is easily resolued, for if1. That by the Ciuill law if a man be bou^d to appeare within tenne daies the te^th day is taken inclusiue. he appeare within the two daies or three daies, it is clearely sufficient because the last daie that is put in the citation, doth implie that he may differre his appearaunce vnto the last daie ff. de verb. oblig. l. qui ante Calendas and l. eum qui ita ff. eod., and though an appeale be to be brought within 10. daies after the iudgement, yet the last daie is taken inclusiue, and not exclusiue ff. de success. edict: l. 1. @. dicimus.: and if time be giuen to one either by the partie or by Lawe, that

Al wro^gs and offences are either1. A diuersitie of opening and prosecuting of priuate and publike offences at the Co^mon law. priuate, or publique, priuate offences, which are done by one ma^ to the hurt of an other, are made knowne to the Court, and remedied by originall writte, bil or plaint: publique offences, which are committed by the partie against the Queene and Commonweale, are opened and punished by way

It is true and our law doth generally disallow such proceeding, and therfore the name of a delator or informer is in our law accompted dishonest L. 3. C. de Iniur.: and therefore it saith expresly.

Thus you deterre informers fro^ their iust accusations by minatorie speaches, vttered by male-contented persons, but as archers when they ayme at a marke do often shoote beside it, so you disputing of this questio^, haue spoken5. Codicgnostes is* charged by Anglonomophylax to mistake the point in question. cleane beside the purpose, for the question is not whether some delators or informers be dishonest men, and intollerable in a common weale: for none will doubt of that: but whether no informers ought to be suffered in a good Common weale: and these censures of informers which you haue brought out of histories and out of the Ciuill law do onely respect, and concerne such6. He is likewise charged eo mistake the Ciuill law in this point. lewde persons, which by slaunderous detractio^ doe traduce and falslie accuse men of honest life and good report, thorough the vile and corrupt desire of vniust lucre, whose informations Tacitus calleth Interpretationes, interpretations, that is a wresting to an ill sense of that which was well meant, or a misco^struing of that which was done without euill intent or conueyance Tacit. lib. 3. anuali.: and Suetonius tearmeth the^ Calumnias slaunderous accusations Sueton. in Domiti. c. 9., such men did not openly prooue, but secretely impeach the good name of others, as Cuiaci well obserueth Cuiaci. ad Paulum., but none of your former speeches do touch these, which prooue directly
 and fully that which they alleage in their information neither doth your law (for I looke sometime into it) punish such L. 8. 10. 12. C. Th: de pet. and delat. l. 1. ad S. C. Tu^p. ff., but if they doe not proue their surmises, they are worthily punished:7. The statute of 18. of our soueraigne lady the Queene touching commo^ informers is compared with the edicts of Emperours. and by the statut of 18. Eliz. it is wel prouided, that if any such informer shal willingly delay his suit or shall discontinue, or be nonsuit in the same, or shall haue the triall or matter passe against him therin by verdict, or iudgeme^t of law, that the^ in euery such case the same informer shal yeeld, satisfie, and paie vnto the said defendant his costes, charges and da^mages to be assigned by the court in which the same suit shal be atte^pted 18. Eliz. c. 5. Rast. Inform. 1: and wheras you say that your lawe doth generally disallow such proceeding, by your fauour it is not so, for he which by office is appointed and charged to informe, or by some other obligation of Lawe is bou^d to informe, and he which doth it directly for the profite of the common weale is allowed by your law to execute that course of proceeding L. 1. l. 2. and l. 6. Ad S. C. Turpil: ff.,Codicgnostes his surmise that informations were not vsed in the best times of the Romanes is answered and confuted. furthermore in that you say, that informers did neuer florish in the Romane co^mon weale, but vnder tyrants, it is not true, for in the times betwixt the 2. and last Carthagenian warre the Romanes did most excell in vertue, and were most renowmed for good exa^ple and desert as witnesseth Salust a great iudge in matters of state, and in the ma^ners of me^, whose testimonie S. Augustine neither doth affirme nor denie but qualifieth with this censure, Toto illo interuallo ^uorum bellorum punicoru^ tolerabilior infaelicitas fuit S.

 pulcher, egregius, pius, sanctus, atque magnificus Flor. histor. lib. 2. c. 19.: I saie in these happie times, or if you will in these last vnhappy times of the Romane co^mo^ weale, certen informers were earnestly busied in courts which were the^ tearmed (as appeareth by Plautus Plaut. in Pers., who liued in those times) quadruplatores, because they had the 4. part of the forfeiture of the defenda^t Festus., if their informatio^ were true, and these were acco^pted alone, and in the same degree with delatores Vopisc. in Aureli.. This may suffice to infring that which you haue deliuered, Codicgn. against informers: Now giue me I pray you a little leaue to proue that informers are not onely tolerable in a well gouerned co^mon weale, but euen expedient and9. It is shewed likewise that informations are expedient for the administration of Iustice. necessarie instruments for the good administration of Iustice: but alwaies I require in the^ honestie, faithfulnes, and conscie^ce taking this to be an infallible rule, that he can neuer be a good informer, who is not a good man. These qualities being in the^, and truth being the grou^d of their proceeding, I see no reason but that their paines should be recompensed and rewarded, sometime with the 4. parte, somtime the third, sometime the moitie of the forfeiture, which the defendant by diuerse penall statuts is to foreit and incurre: for by reward the spirits of a ma^ are stirred vp and quickned: without it they linger, languish, and consume away, and why is reward due vnto such men? The causes and reasons be many, without informatio^ there wil be hardly any punishme^t inflicted vpo^ manie offendors, and sithence nothing is more acceptable to God, or beneficiall to the common
 weale, then that offendors should receiue their proper and co^digne punishment, all lawful meanes must be assaied to atteine to this effect, and what doth restraine men more fro^ co^mitting offences the^n a continuall feare of the informers eie to be cast vpon the^, or his eares to be ope^ for the harkning out of their offences: wherfore as the Hu^tsma^ doth bestow vpo^ his dogs some part of these beasts which he taketh and killeth in hunting, that by such inticements they may bee afterwarde drawne to pursue there praie fiercely and eagerly, so it behoueth a lawmaker diligently to hunt out the domestical lions and wolfes, and to allow some reward to the hounds of the Common weale, which informers are Plutar. in Lucul.: Conanus the king of Scots did make a law, that in euery great Church there should be a cheste hauing some holes in the top, into which the informers might put in at pleasure their seuerall billes of information, wherein the fault committed, the place, the time, the witnesses and the parties accused weare conteined: then the Magistrate openeth the cheste, bringeth the matter into question, and the guiltie person being condemned the halfe parte of the goods forfeited goeth to the informer: which lawe is now put in practise, by them of Millaine Bodin. li. 4. de repub. c. 6..

This is a very long and circumstantiall libell, and to my vndersta^ding, many exceptions may be taken to it, which you shall giue me leaue for argument sake, and for my more vnderstanding in order to pursue. First when you say2. Exception is taken to the forme of the libell for vncertaintie. in declaring the words, which are the originall occasion of this action, that he spoke talia verba seu in effectu similia, me thinkes that should not be good forme, for your libell being like to a declaration at the Common lawe, should be certaine, and without ambiguous or equiuocall tearmes, but of this matter I require the censure of Anglonomophylax.


Anglonomoph.
Your exception is good, and3. The exception is approued by the common law. maintenable by our Lawe: for in an action vpon the case brought for calling the plaintife false Iustice of Peace, vel his similia, these words his similia were ordered by the Court to bee expunged, or blotted out by reason of the vncertaintie 4.

Nonomath.
Your libel likewise displeaseth me4. Exception is likewise taken to the libell for mingling things of seuerall and diuerse natures in it. in an other matter, because if I conceiue aright, you lay and alleage in your libell as the grou^d of your actio^ things farre dista^t in nature, which it seemeth to me might very well beare two seueral actio^s: for whe^ as you say, that the defendant vttered these words (thou naughtie theefe etc.) me thinks that of it self should be are action: and whe^ you say further that (in personam ipsius actoris irruit, and cum pugno pluribus ictibus ipsum actorem
 in faciem percussit liuores and concussiones fecit) I thinke vnder fauour that these wordes of them selues require a seueral and distincte action, and not such an action as lyeth for vtterance of slaunderous wordes.


Anglonomoph.
Your opinion is good and sound5 This exception likewise is maintained by common law. in reason, and as for seueral diseases there be diuerse medicines, so for seueral wronges (I meane such as are different in nature) there should be seuerall Actions, least the offeringe of these thinges iointly to the vnderstandinge, which are different in substaunce, there arise a great confusion and disproportionable Chaos: Wherfore by our law, if things of sundrie natures be mingled in one action, and the action is good for the one and not for the other, in such case the writ shal abate as to that for which it was misconceiued, for example in a writ of Trespas for breaking his close, and taking away certaine lambes, whereas the lambes were supposed to be tithe, and the close to be the Churchyard parcell of the Vicarage, brought by the Parson against the Vicar, it was helde that the Court should be outed of iurisdiction as to the lambes, and the defendant should aunswere to the residue, 13. R. 2. Iurisdict' 19. and so in an action of Trespas brought against the Lorde for breaking his close, and taking his horse vi and armis, it was ruled that the writte shoulde abate for taking the horse, did not as to the breaking of the close: 48. E. 3. 6. For the Lord cannot iustifie the breaking of his tenants close, 20. E. 4. 2. 7. R. 2 Briefe 632. 8 H. 4. 16 8. E. 4. 15: 10. E. 4. 7. So in an action of Trespasse for entering into a Warren brought by the
 tenant against the Lord of the soile, and for chasing there, and taking of conies the writ shall abate as to the entre into the warren vi and armis, and shal stand good for the remnant, 3. H. 6. 13. and if it appeare by the writ or the declaratio^ that the action wil not lye, for somethinges mencioned in the writ, yet the writ may be in force for the remnant, as in a writ of Wast, if a man assigne parcel of the wast in a thing which cannot properly be said to bee wast, the writ notwithstanding shal not abate for the whole, and so a writ of Dower shall not abate for the whole, though the plaintife doe demaund Dower of something, whereof she is not endowable, 9.

E. 4. in a writ of Entre brought vpon the statute of 5. of King Richarde the second for entring into a Mannor and into an aduowson, because the action will not lie for the aduowson, it was held by Lakin, that the writ should abate for parcel, 8.

R. Actio^ sur le case 52. but in Adamses case it was ruled, that whereas an action vppon the case was brought for speaking these words (you haue made a false record, I wil make you aunswere where you dare not shewe your face, and you haue sought my death) the defendant as to the falsifiyng of the recorde iustified, because he did make a misentrie once into a rolle in a Court where hee was Stewarde, and as to the rest he pleaded non Culpable, and hee was founde guiltie of the whole, and damages were assessed to twenty poundes, and it was mooued for stay of Iudgement, that some of the wordes would not beare action, as namely to say (that he sought his death,) because that may bee by due meanes in Lawe: nor the other wordes (that he woulde make him aunswere where he durst
 not shewe his face) wherefore because no action will lie for part of the matter alleaged, the assessement of the damages for the whole is not good, and therefore iudgement ought not to be giuen: to which it was answered that when words are spoken to the disgrace of a man, they cannot be otherwise vnderstood then in malam partem, and therefore to say to one that he hath beene layed of the pockes is t^ bee intended of the Frenche pockes, and though action will not lye for some of the wordes which were vttered, yet it must be intended that damages were assessed for these wordes which are of effect to beare action: and this case hath bin adiudged that one called an other villaine and stronge theefe, the defendant pleaded non Culpable, and he was found guiltie to the damages of xl. li. though action doe not lye for the wordes verie villaine, yet iudgement was giuen that the plaintife should recouer the entier damages: and so was iudgment giuen in the principall case. 25.

Wel no more of this: giue me leaue6 An other exception is taken for superfluous alleaging of the day and hower of the trespasse done. further to obiect, what need you say in your libel die decimo nono Augusti proxime praeteriti? for it is not materiall when a wronge is done, but mee thinkes it shoulde suffice to alledge that it was done, and therefore much lesse neede you haue said hora tertia vel circa: againe, me thinkes your libel is too prolixe in setting downe the words and circumstances of the iniurie: and likewise you haue vsed too many wordes in describing the assault and batterie, which might haue bin
 briefly expressed by these words insultum in eum fecit and eum verberauit, neither doe I see the vse of these wordes pacifice conseruando, neminique iniuriam8 Exception is take^ for saying nemini iniuriam inferendo. inferendo: For what if Titius the plaintife had beene fighting, with Seius a straunger, is it therefore lawfull for Sempronius the defendant in this case to assault and beate Titius? and what neede you say in your libell, animo iniurioso: for9 Exception is likewise taken for vsing these words animo i^iurioso being taken for a surpl^sage. no wronge can bee done without an iniurious meaning, and the secreate meaning must needes appeare by the open description of the wronge.


Codicgn.
Giue me leaue to satisfie you in all these particuler obiections, and to render a reason of the allegations in the libell. The very day10 Codicgn. answereth the exceptions. wherein the wronge was done (to beginne with your first obiection) is necessarily to bee sette downe, that the defendant may haue certaine notice of the wrong: @. atrox: Institut: de iniur: and that it may appeare to the Court, that the iniurie was committed within the yere etc. for a verball iniurie is ended and ceaseth within the yeare etc. l. non solum: @. 1. ff. de iniur: and whereas you disliked the multitude of wordes in discribing the wronge, surely the wronge cannot better be discribed then by fulnesse of tearmes, which are apte and significant to agrauate the iniurie, l. praetor. @. sin: and l. vulneris and l. si est questionis, and l. sed si vnus. @. quidam. ff. de iniur. and whereas you finde fault, because it is alleaged in the libell, that the plaintife did behaue himselfe peaceably nemini iniuriam inferendo: they are to verie good purpose, for if the plaintife had beene a quarrellous, or contencious person, and had giuen some occasion of strife, the wrong might with more reason bee imputed to him,
 then the defendant, Glo. in l. ob haec verba ff. de his qui no: inf: and in l. 1. @. cum arietes ff. si quad^up. paup: fec: and hee cannot be sayd to haue done a wrong, who incontinently for his safegarde after the same maner, whereby hee is assaulted doth defende himselfe, for when a man is assaulted by weapons, he may resist with weapons, l. vt vim: ff. de inst: and iure l. si quis percustor: C. ad leg: Cor. de sicar: but if he doe exceed measure in repealing iniurie, as if being vexed with wordes he resiste with weapons, and by such resistance doe beate or wounde the partie, he that is so grieued may haue an action of iniurie against him, l. sententiam @. qui cum aliter, ff. ad l. Aquil. and recouer damages: l. item apud La be one^. @. si quis seruo ff. de iniur: and to prescribe some temper and moderation in the resisting of verbal and actuall iniuries, I reme^ber a verse not altogether vnpleasant:


Res dare pro rebus, pro verbis verba solemus,


Pro bufis bufas, pro trufis reddere trufas:


Thinges must be recompenced with thinges, buffets with blowes:
And wordes with wordes, and taunts with mockes, and mowes.
And to conclude, you seeme not (with your fauour be it spoken) iustly to reproue these words animo iniurioso, for they are expressed for difference sake, because if a man in iesting wise should strike an other or vse broad boward against him, this woulde not beare an action, because it was not done animo iniuriandi, sed iocandi. l. illud peraeque, ff. de inim: and l. si non conuicij C. cod: this I think you are sufficiently quieted in opinion as to the doubts which you proposed.


Nomomat.
Nay verily I rest as yet doubtful, and for the fuller clearing of my minde, I woulde haue Anglonomoph. to speake somewhat of these thinges out of the common Law, which in matters
 of declaration and pleading is very curious and exquisite.


Anglonomoph.
Truth and error are both equally11 Anglo. particularly examineth and discusseth the exceptions. beholden vnto you, for in some thinges by the censure of our Law one of you hath the vpper hand, in other some the other: for proofe hereof I will by your patience particularly handle euery of the aforesaid obiections, which hath in it any colour of truthe, as to the day of the moneth wherein the wronge is supposed to be done, I doe nott with Codicgnostes thinke that in this case the very day necessarily ought to haue bin mentioned, because it is not trauersable nor materiall to make any issue, but it is sufficient (for obseruing formalitie) to set downe any day that is past.


Codicgn.
But with vs it is material, and if the day be not truely set downe, the defendant may take aduantage of it.


Anglonomoph.
With vs it is not so, for as Newton saith 20. H. 6. the day in an action of Trespas and repleuin are not trauersable, for if the defendant iustify at an other day after, he ought to say without that he tooke them before, 20. H. 6. 40. per Newt. and so 19. H. 6. in a trespas of battery the def. said that the plaintife did assault him at an other time, then he hath declared, and that the hurt which was done vnto him came of his own wro^g, sans ceo that he was Culpre before or after, and this ple he was enforced to pled by the court, 19. H. 6. 47. yet in some case the day and time for auoiding vncertainty, and that the Iurie may more easily find out the truth is issuable, and therefore in an action of trespas supposing a batterie,
 the defendant said, that the same day, wherein the trespas was supposed, the plaintif and the defendant by common accorde did play together at cudgels, and the hurte which he did vnto him was by that play, without that, that he hurt him in any other maner, iudgme^t si action: To which the plaintife replyed, that the same day when they were departed, the defendant came vnto him and assaulted him and beate him of his owne wronge, and the defendant reioined that all the day and at euerie time of the day by their common accorde they played together, without that that he beate him in other maner, 12. R. 2. Barr^ 244. And so in a repleuin of his beastes wrongfully taken, the first day of August the defendant auowed, because the plaintife helde the lande etc. of him by homage and fealtie and suit at his Court at such a place, and because he was summoned to bee at his Court the fifth day of the said moneth and yeare, and did not come he was amerced, and for the sayd amerciament hee tooke the beastes the twenteth day of August, without that, that he tooke them the first day of August, and it was sayd by Markeham that this was no plea: for if you toke the^ at an other day before the presentment it is wrongful, wherefore you ought to say without that that you tooke the beastes before the twentith day: but issue was in this case taken, without that he tooke them the first day of August, 20. H. 6. 40. whereupon Master Fitzherbert noteth, that the day in a writte of Trespasse or Repleuin is not trauersable, but where the speciall matter
 doth require it, Fitz. Repl. 7. and this he seemeth to ground vpon 2. H. 4. likewise in an action of trespasse for the taking of goods the 8. day of Aprill the defendant said that the plaintife was possessed of them as his proper goods and chattels, and solde them to such a one who left them in the custodie of the plaintife, and after he solde them to the defendant, wherefore he tooke them at the time time supposed, to which the plaintife replyed, that he was possessed of them vntil the defendant took them the 8. day of April as before hath bin alleaged, sans ceo that the other solde them to the defendant before that day, and hereupon they were at issue. 2. E. 4. 16.

Well let this matter passe, what say you to the multitude of wordes vsed in the description of the wrong? is that the tollerable in your Law?


Anglonomoph.
Surely it is conuenient that the12 Anglo. Excuseth and defendeth the abundance of words in declarations and libels. qualitie of euery thing should be apparanted by termes of efficacie, and it is better to haue a declaration too copious then carion-leane, neither is any thing more plausible to a good vnderstanding, then that words be ponderous and emphaticall, where the matter seemeth to bleed, wherefore Virgill in describing the loftie pace of the lusty and couragious horses, maketh his verse after a sort to gallop, and doth in liuely termes as it were present it to the eye,
Quadrupedante putrem cursu quatit vngula campum. And Persius decently maketh his verse to rise and swell with the matter.

Wel what say you to these words (animo iniurioso) whether are they needles or not.


Anglonomoph.
These words carry sense in their
 foreheads: for they amount to as much as malitiose in our Law and that ought to be set downe to distinguishe it from iocose as Codicgn. hah before verie well reasoned: and when the action soundeth to malice, the worde malitiose or the like in substance is to be vsed, as well as when the action soundeth to deceite, the worde fraudlenter or some equiuolent tearme is of necessitie to bee expressed.

Vpon like consideration and to the very15 The diminishing of delaies by the common law. same purpose our lawmakers haue made lawes for amendement of writs, declarations, and other proceedings in matters of forme, as may appeare by seuerall statutes made for the establishing of such amendements, as namely 14. E. 3. ca. 6. 9. H. 5. c. 4. 4. H. 6. c. 3. 8. H. 6. c. 12. and 15. 32. H. 8. c. 30. 18. Eliz. c. 14. 27. Eliz. c. 5. and by the equity and direct meaning of these statutes diuers amendementes haue bin made and vsed in our law, and therfore in an action of debt grounded vpon a recouerie of damages had in an assise, the date of the writ of Assise was not put in the writ of debt, and it was held that it should be amended, because the Clarke had the recorde for his instruction, 13. H. 7. 21. but
 whereas a writte of debt was brought per Iohannem Gargraue Esquire, and the obligation was Ioan Gargraue onely, this was not amended, but abated, because this misprision came of the plaintifes part, Quaere tamen, but 8. E. 4. and 11. E. 4. if an action of debt the Clarke of the Chauncerie haue the obligation with him at the time of the making of the writte, and there be variance betweene the writte and the obligation, it is clerely amendable, but if no addition bee giuen to the defendant, that is not amendable, 8. E. 4. 4. 11. E. 4. 2. and 22. Ed. 4. if an action of debt bee brought against executors of the debt of the testator, if the writ be in the Debet and Detinet, it is not amendable, 22. E. 4. 21. per Cur. and in a writte of Audita querela the surname of the defendant was Langawaite, and in the Indenture of Defeasance his name was Langwaite without the letter (a) in the middest, whereuppon the writ was amended by statute, because that was not of the substance of the name, or surname, and also it was to bee intended that the Clarke had the Indenture of Defeasance at the time of the making of the writte, 21 H. 6. 8. and so in an action of debt, where the writte was Hille, and the Obligation was Hulle, the writte was amended, 22. H. 6. Amendm^t 31. 37. H. 6. 32. and where more was in the Obligation then in the writte, it was amended, 19. H. 6. Amendm^t 47. but 41. E. 3. it is helde by Finch. that a writte originall shall abate for default of forme, and shall not bee amended in the Courtes of common Lawe, for though it be pleadable there, yet (as Master Statham reasoneth) the Chauncerie is an other
 Court, and a superiour Court: Stath. ti^ Amend 20. H. 6. and therefore the things done there cannot bealtered in Courts of common Law, 41. E. 3. 14. ^ Finch. 9. H. 7. 16. per Vauis. and 2^. E. 4. 20. and for the more ful and forcible destruction of delayes and ambushes in pleading, it is by the common Lawe ruled, that euerie demurrer vpon a plea which goeth in barre, and to the disproofe of the Title is peremptorie: and thoughe a plea in Abatement of a writte bee not peremptorie, but a respondeat vlterius* yet if the plea in Abatement of a writte bee tryed by the Cuntrie, this is doubtlesse peremptorie for the delay of the partie, 48.

The eleuenth Dialogue of common wrongs and Trespasses.

NOmomath.
Now that ye must treate of1. Diuision. common wro^gs and trespasses, I doubt not but you wil be lesse troubled with my questions, because such matters ar more plaine to you, and to me not very difficult. Notwithstanding for learning sake, and because I would ground my selfe vpon some certaintie of knowledge, I will mooue some doubts of these matters: first how many sorts or wro^gs are there?


Codicg.
Iniurie as we say is two folde, for either1. The diuerse kinds of iniuries in the Ciuill lawe. it is done re or verbis: re, when a man is assaulted
 or beaten: verbis, when a man is slaundered and by tearmes disgraced or discredited L. 1. ff. de iniut^^s..


Nomomath.
I pray you Anglonomophylax illustrate and explaine the members of this diuision by some conuenient cases.


Anglonomoph.
Very willingly, and to beginne2. What an assault is according to the Commo law. with the first: an assault is made when one man menaceth an other with a weapon or staffe, though neuer a blow bestroken, yet this is an assault 22. Assis. pl. 60., and 43. E. 3. the writte was Quare insultum fecit vulnerauit, verberauit and maihemauit, and it was allowed though the wrong did sound to be mayhem 43. Assis. 39., and as it was held per Curiam, where a man maketh an assault it is not lawfull for any to beate him, if the partie assaulted may escape with his life 2. H. 4. 8., yet the opinion of M. Brooke is that he may beate him if he cannot otherwise escape without stripes or wounds or mayming Br. Trespasse 71., yet the opinion of 9. E. 4. is, that I may beate a man if he will take my goods from me: and a seruant may iustifie a batterie in the defence of his maister 9. E. 4. 28. and 48., but the assembling of people in a warlike ma^ner is no assault, but he that is the ringleader of such assemblies, before hee may be impeached of assault must doe something els, as namely by vttering contumelious speeches, or stretching out his armes, or some other token whereby his intent may be knowen 17. E. 4. 4., and he that commeth in companie of them that make the assault, or hee which commeth to ayd them, is a principal trespassor 22. Assis. pl. 43., and if a Iustice of Peace see a man doing an assault, he may presently arrest him by commandement
 or worde, to the intent that he may finde suretie of the peace 9. E. 4. 3., and it is lawfull for one ma^ to beate an other in defense of his goods and chattels or of his wife 19. H. 6. 31. 35. H. 6. 51., and a man may likewise haue an action of trespasse for the entring into his house Fitzh. N. B. 88. l., but if a man licence one to come into his house, and he doth a trespasse there he shal be punished for the trespasse but not for the entre which was grau^ted vnto him 3. H. 7. 15. p Townes., and nothing3. That the Common law giueth an action vpon the case for a slaunder. is more vsuall then a man to bring an actio^ vpon the case for a slaunder, and therefore if one man call an other bankerupt an action vpon the case will lie 6. E. 6. 72. Dy., or if one say to an other that he is infected of the robberie and murder lately committed and smelles of the murder, an action vpon the case will lie for these wordes 15. Elizab. 317. Dy., and the Duke of Buckingham brought an action de scandalis magnatu^ against one Lucas, because he said that the said Duke had no more conscience the^ a dogge, and so he had goods he cared not how he came by them 4. H. 8. rotul. 659., infinite other cases might be brought tending to this purpose.

I wil trouble you no further herein,2 Diuision. but tell me Codicgnostes, whether by your law may the husband haue an action for the wrong doneto his wife, the father for a wrong done to his sonne, and the maister for an iniurie done to1. That by the Ciuill law, an action of trespasse lieth by the father, husband, maister, for a wro^g done to the sonne, wife, seruant. his seruant?


Codicgn.
They may, and the Praetors edict in our Law to that intent is very manifest and notorious L. 1. ff. de iniur:.


Anglonomoph.
To that our law accordeth: and
 first to shew, that the husba^d may haue an action2. That by the Common law the husband may haue an action for a wrong done to his wife. for a wro^g done to his wife, it seemeth that these words: and cam cu^bonis and catallis praedicti A. (mariti) ad valentia^ etc. abduxit, are necessarie in the writ, for as to the taking and deteining onely of the woman, it seemeth that the suit will onely lie in the spirituall Court, where things any waie touching matrimonie or to be decided: yet I wil not be peremptorie herein, because M. Fitzherh. opinio^ is Fitzh. N. B. 52. K., that the suit for the taking of the woman onely, without mentioning any other thing in the writ, is maintenable at the Common lawe, howbeit he putteth this case, that if a man sue in court Christian for the taking and deteining of his wife, which was lawfully maried to him, if the other sue a prohibition hereupon, hee may haue a consultation quatenus pro restitutione vxoris suae duntaxat prosequitur Fitzh. ibid., and if the woman do lie asunder from her husband the suit will lie in the spiritual Court to haue againe the fellowship of mariage and to dwell together as may appeare by these wordes of the statute D. Cosins in li. de iurisdict. ecclesiastic.: (vnlesse he wil receiue her without ecclesiastical co^pulsio^ 13. E. 1. c. 34 Westminst. 2.) but where a man bringeth an actio^ at the co^mon Law de muliere abduct a cum bonis viri: he must be sure that his wife hath atteined to age of consent, and that she hath actually co^se^ted to the mariage: for where a ma^ marrieth a wife before she be of the age of 12. yeares, and after she commeth to the age of 12. yeares, and before she assent or disassent one taketh or carieth her away, the husband in this case ca^not haue a writ of trespasse cu^ muliere
 abduct a cu^ bonis viri by some authority, because it is not properly a mariage till she assent 47. E. 3. Br. Trespasse 420.: yet M. Brooke doubteth hereof and rather thinketh vpon very good reason the contrary, because it shall be inte^ded a good mariage vntill the woma^ do disasse^t Brooke ibid.: but where the mariage is co^plete, and without all daunger of contradiction, though the wife be dead or diuorced at the time of the actio^ brought, yet the action is maintenable for the husband 43. E. 3. 22., but the worde (rapuit) must be in the writ as well as the word (abduxit) and therefore it will not lie against a woman, because one woman cannot rauish an other 43. E. 3. 23., and if a man do carie3. In wh^ cases by the Co^mon lawe an action will lie for the maister for a wrong done to his seruant. away a woman by the licence of her husband this writte will not lie 1. E. 4. 1., for it is vi and armis, and as to the bringing of an action by the maister for some hurt done to his seruant, it is freque^t in our bookes: for by the beating, or maiming or wou^ding of the seruant, the maister hath the losse of his seruice 3. H. 6. 53.: and therefore if any man take the serua^t of an other ma^ out of his seruice, an action of trespas wil lieagainst him that taketh him 39. E. 3 38. Fitzh. N. B 91. I. 21. H. 6. 31., but if a ma^ find an other ma^s seruant wa^dring abroad, and reteyne him, this is lawfull, if he knew nothing of the fist reteiner. But though by the common law an action of trespasse quare vi and armis did lie against him that tooke an other mans seruant out of his seruice: yet if he did only procure him to go out of seruice, and the^ reteined him, the maister could haue had by the Common law no action, but only an action vpo^ the case, but now by parliame^t an action is giue^ vpon the statute of


 labourers 11. H. 4. 23. Br. Trespasse. 92.: Lastly it is plaine by our law, that the4. In what cases by the Co^mon law an action will lie for the father for a wrong done to the sonne. father may haue an action for the taking away of his sonne and heire, but in the writte he must say cuius maritagium ad ipsum pertinet: for this writte is giuen vnto the father, because the mariage of his sonne and heire or of his daughter and heire doth of right appertaine vnto him, and if the father haue maried his heire before, so that he hath once enioyed the fruite and benefite of the mariage, which the law allotted vnto him, he shall not haue this writte 12. H. 4. 16. 8. E. 2. Trespas 235. 32. E. 3. Garde. 32., and if a man take away an other mans sonne and heire appara^t and bestow vpon him good apparell, and the father seiseth his sonne as he lawfully may, he shall not be impeached for the taking of the apparell; for in that he may make a good iustification for the taking of the body, the iustificatio^ must needs exte^d to the apparell of the bodie, because the law considereth not bare and elementall bodies, but bodies apparelled: And Haukf. with others resoneth well, that if a man put an other into apparell, and speaketh nothing of the loane of it, neither by expresse acte reserueth the propertie to himselfe, this is a gift in law: and if an aduowterer do take a woman from her husband, and apparelleth her with good attire, the husband may take the wife againe, and with her the apparell 11. H. 4. 31. Br. Trespas 93., and as the father may haue this remedie for his sonne and heire apparant, so may the mother, likewise if shee be an inheritrix 30.

I will require no more at your hands Anglonomoph. of this matter, now I pray you Codicgnostes resolue me in this, whether whe^ any mans beasts do any hurt vnto an other ma^, if this be not done by the owners acte, default, or procurement, shall the maister make good the dammage susteined by such wrong.


Codicgn.
Surely brute beastes, because they1. How the owner shal be punished by the Ciuill law for a trespasse done by his beasts. want vnderstanding and reason, cannot be said properly to bind their owner (noxaliter, so that the fault should be accompted his) for any rauin, hurt, or dammage whatsoeuer, neither do such wrongs bind the owner of the beasts ex quasi delicto, for a matter like vnto a wrong: yet notwithstanding for preuenting of hurt, that may in such sort happe^, the law doth prouide, that if the owner wil not voluntarily yeeld vp the beast as a recompence to him that is enda^maged, he must re^der the da^mages, or els by the authoritie of the iudge be awarded and compelled to yeeld vp the beast L. 1. ff. si quadrup: paup: fec: dic., and therfore if any man do keepe or nourish a Mastife, or Boare, or Foxe, or Beare, or Lion or Wolfe, or some like beast which doth hurt or damnifie an other ma^, he that receiueth the hurt shall recouer da^mages against the owner of the beast @. Caeterum Instit. si quadru: pauperie^ fecisse dicatur., but if such a beast do escape away fro^ me,2. In what case he shall not be punished though his beasts do hurt to an other man. or goeth so farre from my pasture or warde that I cannot by pursuing recouer it, neither doe I know whether it is fledde, and so being escaped from me it doe hurt an other man, in this case I am not to susteyne any dammage, because in this case, I am free from fault: for the beast by
 such escape ceaseth to be mine, and may become his that shall take, or seise, or kill it d. l. 1. @. in bestijs and @. Caeteru^, versic. Denique si vrsus..


Anglonomoph.
To this our Lawe agreeth: for we haue a writ of Trespasse which saith, Quare vi and armis centum oues ipsius A. cum quibusdam canibus fugauit canes illos ad mordendum oues praedictas intantum incitando quod per fugationem illam and morsus canum praedictorum oues praedictae multiplititer deterioratae fuerunt and magna pars ouium illarum faetus abortiuos fecit etc. per quod3. That by the Common law a man shal be punished for a trespasse done by his beasts. etc. Fitzh. N. B. 89. L. But if a Dogge doe kill or hurte any mans beastes, the Maister being ignorant of his mischieuous property, he is not punishable 28. H. 8. 25. Dy. and 29. Dy., wherby I gather that if hee know of his propertie (though he do not set on his dogge or mainteine him to doe hurt to others) hee shall be punished by action of trespasse, and if a man doe driue his beastes thorough the Queenes highe way, to which way my land that is sowne with corne is adioining, and the beasts doe enter and spoile my corne, the owner shall bee punished for this, though hee did driue them out presently, or earnestly endeuour to chase them out of the corne 10. E. 4. 7., so if a man chase his beastes in the highe way, and they doe escape into land, which is not inclosed, ond the owner doth freshly pursue them, and chaseth them out, yet this is no good plea in barre without shewing that the tenant of the lande, and all those whose estate hee hath in the lande, haue vsed to inclose the said land toward the high way 15. H. 7. 17..


Nomomath.
I craue no more of this matter:
 now I would haue you to transferre your inuentio^ to the discourse of other offences against the peace, which I doe thus dispose and distribute to your handling: because all offences against the peace are either in an inferior degree, as these whereof ye haue lastly spoken, or in a middle degree, as vnlawfull assemblies, riots, routes, and forcible entres, or in a higher degree, and they be of three sortes, namely such as be committed against the dignitie of man as treason and rebellion: or against the life of man, as murder, manslaughter, and homicide by chaunce, or against the good estate of man, as thefte, burglarie and robberie: I would therefore haue you first to begin to treate of vnlawfull assemblies, riots etc. and then to goe on with the rest, accordinglie as I haue set them downe.
Codignostes, Canonologus, Anglonomophylax, we are willing to pleasure you in anie thing that we can, and as you propose doubtes of euerie of these titles seuerallie, we will endeuour to satisfie and resolue you to our power.

Anglonomophylax.
That likewise is publique2. That in the matter of publike force, the Common law agreeth with the ciuill. force by our law: of priuate force done to a ma^s person wee haue spoken before, which if it be publickly done, it turneth to be publicke force, but as to the taking away of goods by open force, if a man doe disseisie an other, and when hee hath entred* hee doth carie away the chattels of the disseisie, this is in our Lawe a disseisin3. A differe^ce by the Common lawe betwixt publike force and op^n force. with force and armes, and the disseisor shall be punished by imprisonment 11. H. 4. 16. Westminst. 1. c. 37. 4.

The punishment of this fault in our4.

 but if nothing bee done forcibly, but certaine men hauing weapons are assembled in a great multitude together to committe force, the punishment of that offence is arbitrarie and leste to the discretion of the Iudge, but the Lawe setteth downe this mulcte in certaine, that if he be a man of woorth hee shall paie to the common treasurie an hundred pounds in gold, whosoeuer in such sort offendeth L. si.

Our Law is likewise seuere against2.

The thirtenth Dialogue of Treason and Rebellion.

NOmomath.
Let me know Codicgnostes, before we enter into particuler1. Diuision. inquirie of the thinges, which are in themselfes, and ipso facto treason, what in auncient times, and other common weales, hath bene taken to be treason, and how hath it bin punished, for I thinke that will giue great light to matters subsequent, because that which is past was the originall of that which is present, and it is good in matters of Common weale to haue a diligent retrospect to the course of former ages.1. The reason is shewed by Codicgnostes wherfore treason is aptly tearmed a fault against the dignitie of man.


Codicgn.
It is true: and first I will shew how aptly you haue tearmed this offence to bee a crime or fault against the dignitie of man: for as nothing should more debase mans nature, the^ if
 against ma^, whom God hath made little inferiour to the Angels, whom he hath crowned with glorie and worship, whom he hath made Lord of the workes of his hands, and hath put all things vnder his feete: Psal. 8. ver. 6. 7. 8. 9. If I say against him the beastes of the fielde should rage and rebell, as it happened in Roome, when as a preamble of the fatall confusion of that Citie, all the beastes subiecte and necessarie to mans vse, namely dogges, horses, asses, oxen, etc. would not suffer their Masters to touche them, or come neare them without destruction and perill: Orosi: lib. 5. Iuli: Obseque^s in lib. de prodit D. Augustin: lib. 3. de ciuitat: dei c. 23. so surely when they, who are in subiection to a Prince or monarche, doe violently and mutinously breake the bonde of obedience and loyaltie, and will doe as they list, and thereupon rebell, and trecherously conspire against the life of their Prince, this is against the dignitie of man, who being Lorde of brutishe creatures, doth imitate them, and becommeth as wilde and sauage and disobedient as they. Now I will call to remembrance, how this disloyaltie or trecherie in the highest degree, hath in other ages receiued censure and punishment. Traytors2 The punishment of treaso^ in auncien^ times. were alwaies loathed, detested, and sharpely punished of the Romanes: and treason was acco^pted farre more greeuous then paricide, Dionis. Halicarnass. tit: 2. and 8. somtime they were throwne headlong downe a rocke, as Cassius: sometime hanged, as Lentulus and others of Catilines seditious societie, or by some speciall kind of infamous death executed, as Suetonius reporteth, Sueton: in Neron: c. 49. and they which conspired against Augustus, when he was newly come to
 the Empire, bore the smart of their treacherous designements, and were seuerely punished for the imagination of that heinous mischiefe. Dio Nicae: in August: This Iustice of the heathens is iustified by diuine authoritie. Non mittam manum meam in vnctum domini. 1. Reg. c. 24 Quare non timuisti mittere manum tuam vt occideres vnctum domini: 2. Reg. c. 1. for surely the maiestie of a Prince offended and hurt, doth require a deepe reuenge: and if Nemesis, that is Reuenge it selfe, doe take sharpe punishment of those which offer any violence to the person of an Embassador, Appian^in select: representing a Prince or monarche; with what extremitye of payne are they to bee tortured, which imagin or goe about to compasse the death and downefall of their liege and dread soueraigne: Wherefore worthily doth the excellent Lawier out of the Code applye these titles of Maiestie vnto kings and Monarches: Celeste oraculum, diuinitas, Eternitas, Eternales vultus. Alber^c: Gentilis lib. 2. lection: and epistolar: c. 14. Maiestie therefore, which by some is said to be the daughter of honor and reuere^ce, ought alwaies, and in al things to be respected with honor and reuerence.

Eliseus by a wonderfull miracle did make the Syrians enemies to the King of Israel his captiues, whom the King woulde haue slaine, but the Prophet did forbid him by this argument, that they which are taken in warre ought not to bee slaine, much lesse these whom God had giuen vp into his hands. 4.

It seemeth that wee make more7 Anglo.

Nomom.
Indeede Codicgnostes you haue not, as to me seemeth, comprehe^ded in your diuision all the particuler kindes of Homicide: for you seeme vnder your first member, which is the wilfull killing of a man of malice forethought, to comprehend manslaughter, which is done in the heate and furie of anger and sodaine falling out.


Codicgn.
In deed so I did meane it, for our most8 An other diuision of homicide by the ciuil Law. compendious and complete diuision of Homicide is thus: either it is done destinato, or necessario, or casu destinato, when a man of malice preconceiued doth kill himselfe or an other man, as Nero, Iudas, and others, which kinde of manslaughter is impious, because the power of life and
 death is Gods and not ours, and therefore is not to be vsurped by man, wherefore we haue a verie good rule. Nemo membrorum suorum dominus est: l. liber homo ff. ad leg. Aquil. and l. lex Cornelia @. Constitutu^ ff. ad l. Corn. de sicar. Necessario a man committeth manslaughter, when he doth it in his owne defence, and to beate backe force by force, which kinde of manslaughter being done by necessitie, and not by will, deserueth pardon according to the saying:


Iudice me, fraus est concessa repellere fraudem:


Armaque in armatos sumere iura sinunt.


And it is a Maxime in our Law: Quod quisque in tutelam corporis sui fecerit, iure fecisse existimatur: l. vt vim. ff. de inst. and iur. Casu Homicide is committed, when a man killeth one not purposing that, but doeing an other thing, as the Hebrewes doe report of Lamech, that meaning to strike a wild beast he killed Cain with his darte, Ioh. Wolph. in Comm. ad Deuteronom. lib. 2. and so you may perceiue that we comprehende that which you call murder, and that which you call manslaughter vnder that kinde of Homicide which is committed destinato.


Nomomath.
I doe rather perceiue it, then approoue it: wherefore I woulde haue you Anglonomoph. to shewe the difference betwixt these two kindes in their seuerall natures, and what difference they holde from other kindes of Homicide, that so I may more easily vnderstande wherein your Lawes agree or disagree, and likewise the reasons of the said accordance and disagreement.


Anglonomoph.
The dyfference of killinge
 men voluntarie and inuoluntarylie is verie auncient.8 The difference of killing men voluntarily and inuoluntarily is shewed to be auncient. Genes. 9. and 4. Exod: 21. Deutre. 5. Leuit. 24. Num. 35. Deuter. 19. And Demosthenes sayeth, that the Phaenicians dyd punnishe such as did voluntarylie kill menne with death, and with the losse of all that they had: but such as did vnwillinglie cause the death of a man, they did pardon, and forgiue: Demost. in orat. contr. Mid. But the difference betwixt murder and manslaughter hath not beene heretofore much opened, or effectuallie stoode vppon, which because it is large, and of great compasse in our Lawe, I will (God permitting mee) by some cases make cleare and apparant and then discende to the discription of the other9 The definition of murder by the common law. kindes of Homicide. Murder is when a man killeth an other feloniously vppon malice fore thought, Pl. Com^ 261. and it is not materiall whether hee kill him openly or secreatly, or whether he that is slaine bee an Englishman, or of other nation, if hee liue in this Realme vnder the Queenes protection, Stamf. 18. and hee can not haue10 Malice whereof murder commeth, is shewed to be twofolde and diuerse cases are put thereupon. the benefitte of Clergie and Sanctuarie, 22. H. 8. c. 1. and there bee two sortes of malice which are motiues to this horrible acte, namely a malice implyed and a malice expressed: malice implyed is when one killeth an other sodainelie, without any defence on the part of the other: malice expressed, when it is knowne that there is malice betwixt the parties: Crompt. Iust. P. 19. I wil illustrate both these seuerall kindes with seuerall cases, beginning first with malice implyed. A Gaoler had malice to a Recusant who was in his warde, because he suspected that he was too familiar with
 his wife, and after the prisoner purchased to goe out of prison, as hee went before for his disporte, and the Gaoler suddenly stroke the prisoner vpon the head, so that he fel to the ground, whereupon he died, and this was adiudged murder at the Assises at Chester: Cromp. Iu. P. 20. And if a theefe rob an other man, and kil him, this is murder, though he did neuer see the man slaine before, and though hee had neuer inueterate malice against him: yet hee had malice before the murder to this intent, that hee woulde rather kill him then bee disappointed of his purpose. Com. 474. Two fought together of malice forethought, hauing purpose to kill, and a straunger came to part them, and one of them killed him, this was felony in them both, and they both were executed because they had an intent the one of them to kill the other, and this acte came originally of that: 22. E. 3. Co^on^ 262. and Dyer 120. And if the Iustices of Peace with the Sherife come to suppresse riotours, and one which attendeth vppon them is slaine by one of the riotors, this is murder in him, and in all the other riotors which are present, Cromp. Iu. P. 21. And if a man without quarrell offered doe kill one of the standers by this is murder, Crompt. Iu. P. 22. proceeding from implyed malice, Lam. E^renarch. 255. Thus farre of malice implyed: malice expressed may more easily appeare vnto you, as if a man bring an appeale of felony against B. and the said B. meeteth the plaintife and they quarrell together vpon the vsing of the said appeale, and fight, and B. killeth the plaintife, this seemeth to be murder. Cromp. Iu. P. 21. and if a man be attainted
 of murder hee shall suffer paine of death, and11 The punishment of murder by the common law. shall sorfaite landes and goods and chattels: but manslaughter as it is in facte lesse heinous, so it is12 The discription of manslaughter by the common law. in punishment lesse greeuous: for it is then committed when two or more fight together vpon the suddaine without malice precedent, and the one of them killeth the other, in such case13 The punishment of manslaughter by the common law. the offendour shall haue his Clergie, Cromp. I. P. 23. Com. 261. but shall forfaite his goods, and if two doe fight together without malice precedent, and after diuerse blowes giuen, the one of them flyeth a greate space from the other, and the other goeth into a house verie neare for a weapon, and pursueth incontinent, and killeth him that flyeth, this is but manslaughter, because it was done in a continuing fury, Crompt. Iust. P. 23. and two did fight together vppon the sodaine without malice preconceiued, and one commeth to part them, and the one of them, which fighteth killeth him, this is manslaughter in him, because the fighting was an vnlawfull acte: 22. Ass. Coron^. 180. but if they had fought together Ex malitia precogitata, and the one of them had slaine him, this had beene felonie in them both. (22. E. 3. Coro. 266.

It may be that Codicgnostes had rather beleeue the ce^sures of Romane magistrates in matters of Iustice, then the opinions of Romane and Graecian Philosophers in table talke and common speech. I know by good authority these thinges are condemned, and therefore it is said of such men and their medicines in the Canon. Quae alij scelera, isti remedia nominant c. Illud quod 26. q. 2.: And Tacitus clearely affirmeth that such things medicorum disciplina condemnat Tacit. lib. 1. histor.: And Plutarch calleth such practises Insanias Plutarch. in pericl.: and if Lucian be of any authoritie with you, he saith, Per verbula and incantationes sanitatem operari non credo Lucian. in Philopseud.. Plinie likewise speketh to the same purpose in these words: Maximae quaestionis and semper incertae est, valeantur aliquid verba and incantamenta carminum in medendo: sed viritim sapientissimi cuiusque respuit fides Plini. lib. 28. c. 2.: As for these exorcismes heretofore vsed in the Church, Bodinus teacheth that the Prophets neuer
 vsed in their times any such matter Bodin. lib. 3. daemon., and he5. Answere is made to the aforesaid obiection according to the opinion of Bodmus. saith further, that the primitiue Church neuer vsed them, and he disalloweth the testimonie of Iosephus and disprooueth it in this point: but sithence the matter is so doubtfull, I do not thinke that the law-maker ought to punishe the vsing and applying of charmes or such things, which are for that purpose hanged about the necke of the sicke bodie, if they be innocently done and without mixture of magicke or euill arte, with death: but it principally apperteineth to diuines and preachers to extirpate such superstitions out of the hearts of men, and to teach them that it is irreligious and against the glorie of God, to goe for remedie to such dumbe thinges and not to God himselfe, and that false is that saying of Apuleius, Nihil quod salutis causa fit criminosum est: for there is nothing subiect to the vse of man so good, but it may be abused: yet surelie the Lawes ought not to extend their leueritie against this last recited faulte, if no greater fault bee ioyned with it.

Seneca his opinion of charmes and inchantments is disliked.

If such hurt be done, it is done by the diuell, and the wicked spirits his ministers, which suggest such thinges to selie old women, and are readie to performe them at their commaund: but what fault can be iustly imputed to these wome^.12. Witches are prooued to be apostates and in what manner they become apostates.


Canonol.
Surely their offence is very great, for they are most abominable apostats, and workers of extreame mischiefe, they haue denied Christ and
 vowed the^selfs to the diuel, which ma^ner of vow is done either secretly or expresly: secretly, whe^ one witch or co^iurer voweth with an other coniurer or witch, that in consideration that A. hath promised to B. that he shall do great and meruailous things, as namely that he shall know future things, and do other things, which others shal not be able to do, B. therfore repromiseth to A. that therfore he wil renou^ce the catholike faith, that he will obstinately despise the holy Sacraments, that he will with all his strength and power worship and cleaue to his maister, and will giue to him all kind of adoration vnder the forme of idols: and this is called a secreate protestation because it is not done to the Diuell himselfe but to his seruaunt c. qui sme saluatore. 26. q. 2.

At what place and in what time is this wickednes done?


Canonolog.
It is done in woddie places, or in caues vnder the earth, which are farre remote and distant from the places of mens co^uersation, such darke and shadowed groues, and corners as are very fullie portraited by Lucan Lucan. lib. 3..


Lucus erat longo nunquam violatus ab aeuo


Obscurum cingens connexis aeraramis,


Omnisque humanis lustrata cruoribus arbos:


Illis and volucres metuunt insistere ramis


Et lustris recubare ferae, etc.


In such desolate places, or in ruinated Castels this mischiefe is celebrated, and commonly it is done in the darknes of a most tempestuous night c. Episcopi 26. q. 5., for the Diuell falling from Paradise fell into extreame darkenes, and by defect of grace deliteth in darkenes Thom. Aquinas in tractat. 44. quaestion. 16. artic. 1. est in tit. de daemon., so that all the workes that proceed from him are blacke, horrible, and full of darkenes, cleane contrarie to the workes of our Sauiour Christ, which he did in the open light, for the glorifying of his father and the edifying of his Church.


Nonomath.
Yet my assertion remaineth firme,
 that al the euils whereof you haue before spoke^, are done by the diuell, and not by the witche.


Canonol.
They are done by the witch cooperating13. It is proued that the bodies of witches do worke with their minds in lewd enterprises. with the diuell, who will not do any such hurt without their commau^d, for surely the bewitching of mens bodies must needs be acco^pted their owne worke. The bodies of aged persons or impure, which when they waxe cankered in malice, they vse their very breath and their fight being apte for contagion, and by the diuell whetted for such purpose, to the vexation and destruction of others: for if they which are troubled with the disease of the eies called Ophthalmia, doe infect others that looke earnestly vpon them: is it any meruaile that these wicked creatures hauing both bodies and minds in a higher degree corrupted, should worke both these and greater mischiefs? but their malice doth especially exercise it selfe vpon the weake and tender bodies of children and yong women, which are most subiect to the impression of the ayre that is infected by them as Heliodorus plainely sheweth Heliod. Aethiopic. lib. 3., and that it hath bene so thought in ancient time, may appeare by Theocritus speaking of the remedie which was woont to bee vsed against such witchcraft Theocrit. eidyl. 6. and 7., and againe they deserue seuerely to be punished, not onely for vowing themselfes to the diuell, but also for mingling themselfes in the companie of wicked spirites, which must needes infect their bodies and soules, and so make them apte instruments for the hurting of others.



Nomomath.
I do not thinke, that, that is possible14. Alciate his opinion touching the meeting of witches amongst the^selfes, and the meeting of the the diuell is vrged. to be done, which is commonly reported of witches, dwelling in seuerall places, meeting one an other, and meeting likewise the Diuell, and that opinion holdeth Alciat Alciat. lib. 8. parerg: c. 22., and some other in these daies: wherfore I see no reason that they should be punished for it.


Canonolog.
That is both true and possible, as15. Alciate his said opinion is confronted by the authoritie of Bodinus. against Alciat, and other writers straungely conceited in this point Bodinus hath largely and learnedly disputed: Alciat denieth it to be possible, that naturally bodies, which are saide to meete in places farre distant, should at the naming of Iesus vanishe into the ayre, and be caried swiftly and inuisibly thether, but this is possible enough: For if the Spirites cannot in a moment withdrawe the sight of thinges, surely they can doe very little: for this is manie waies done, and Iuggelers and professours of feates can performe it, and as to the swifte transporting of them to remote places, Bodinus reasoneth well; that if the Spirite of the eight Sphaere of the heauens, doe mooue a thing of so great compasse and quantitie in so shorte a space, that in one howre it passeth aboue a hundred times an hundred miles, why may not a wicked Spirite carie the small bodies of such Witches in the minute of an howre, the space of a hundred or two hundred miles: yet I doe not thinke it possible which some affirme, that the bodies of such witches may pierce through a chinke or riffe of a walle (for the nature of the bodie cannot
 bee altered) but this seemeth rather to be an illusion of the diuell offered to witches: but what of this? suppose that a witche doe confesse vnto a Magistrate, that shee went in by a risse of the walle to kill a childe, which shee did kill, because it is not possible that the witche should passe through such a narrowe creuise, shall the Magistrate therfore absolue the witche as guiltlesse of the childes death? Nay rather let him diuide the matter, and seuer that which is impossible, from that which may bee, namely the passing thorough the riffe of the walle, from the killing of the childe: for it may bee, that in trueth the Diuell brought her in at the dore to kill the childe, though hee made it seeme to her that she came in at a chinke of the wall: but surely if there were no other fault in witches, then the renouncing of God and the abiuring of the Sacramentes; yet this being in it selfe consummate apostasie, doth deserue extreame punishment, and whosoeuer thinketh that witches, because for the most part they be sottish, old, and doting are verie easily deceiued, and therfore ought to be spared, hee is in a great errour, for malice driueth them to desire that, which by the diuels meanes they compasse; whe^ they haue obteined it, their froward nature doth ioy in it, and the diuel for the most part leaueth them, before they leaue him.


Nomomath.
Indeed so it seemeth: for whe^ they fall into the handes of Iustice, and bee cast into close prison, the Diuell commonly practiseth
 no more feates for the^, but suffereth them to susteine the punishment of law without any intermedling for them: but I haue much wondered what should be the cause of this.


Canonolog.
That is done for two causes. First,16. A double reason is alleaged wherefore the diuell worketh not for witches after that they be imprisoned. because the diuell seeketh nothing more desirously then the gaine of their soules: for when he thinketh that the soule is wholly brought vnder his power, he expecteth for nothing so greedily, as the departure of the soule from the bodie, that he may torment the soule, which before the death of the partie he doth retinere sub pacto, and he not onely laboureth, but hasteneth his death as much as hee can, least repentance (God is the God of mercy) doe deliuer the miserable caytife out of the snare of damnation: c. Nec miru^ 26. q. 5. D. Augustin. lib. 3. de Trinit. 10. de ciuitat. dei. Thom. Aquinas in tractat. 44. primae partis quaest. 5. in tit. de mira. an other reason is, wherefore they being imprisoned cannot escape, though the diuell would deliuer them out of prison, is because the Iustice of almightie God will not suffer the diuell to exercise his naturall power for the^: for if he should permit him, God might perhaps seeme to weake and shallow consciences, to haue cast of the care of humane affaires, and of doing Iustice: wherefore for his truth and glorie he will not suffer it D. August. d. lib. 10. de ciuit. dei, and Thom. Aquin. in d. tractat. 44. d. q. 5..

You haue spoken sufficiently of witches, and their lewde practises, of their punishment, and daunger of their soules. Now I would haue you to speake of co^iuration, and necromancie, whether the practises of it are able to worke such effects, as is commo^ly reported, and how by your law they be punishable.

Suetonius in the life of Nero saith, Facto per magos sacro euocare manes tentauit Sueton. in Neron: c. 34.. And Tacitus maketh mention of a certaine yong man misled to this naughtines: Iuuenem improuidum and facilem inanibus, ad Chaldaeorum promissa, magorum sacra, somniorum etiam interpretes impulit, tentatus vt infernas vmbras carminibus eliceret Tacit. lib. 2.

I pray you tell mee when there be such apparitio^s in the persons of the dead, whether are they diuels or dead mens bodies that are so raised vp.


Canonolog.
It is an easie matter to resolue this question, but a harde matter to discourse of it: but shortly to answere it: I thinke they bee Diuels which resemble men that are dead.


Nomomath.
Yet in the booke of Ecclesiasticus18 A discourse of the apparitio^ in the likenes of Samuel. there is speech made of the bodie of Samuell raised by the witch of Endor Ecclesiast. c. 46..


Canonolog.
But that booke is not Canonicall Scripture.


Nomomath.
But a man may reason out of Canonical Scripture that it was no diuell, which appeared to Saul in the likenes of Samuel, because the diuel would not vse such holy speeches as ar attributed to Samuel in the first booke of Samuel, which is Canonicall Scripture 1. Sam. c. 28..


Canonolog.
What meruaile is that? when the diuell can transforme himselfe into an Angell of light? and so hee did deliuer true testimonie of Christ Matth. 8. Mar. 1. Luc. 4., though to a false and euill purpose, and
 likewise of Paule Act. 16., but holy Samuel would not haue suffered any such adoration, as is expressed in that Scripture: and therefore Tremellius and Iunius do rightly comment vpon that place, that it is not in the power of the diuell, nor of the witche his seruant, to drawe againe into the world iust men, but that it was a craftie and false pretense of the diuell, to make men thinke, that the true worshipers of God are in his ha^ds after their death.

Robberie is committed, when a man1 The discription of robberie by the ciuil law. 2 The punishment of robberie by the said law. by force bereaueth an other of his goods, lying in awaite in highwaies and secreate pathes, in woods, in heathes and in other places remoued from the sight and testimonie of men: for this, the offendors head shalbe cutt off with a sword, and he shall sorfait his goods, and his body shall be layed vpon a wheele, vnto which are fastned the
 boughes of these trees, vnder which the robberie was committed, as the witnesses of the crime, l. 1. C. de his qui latron: occult: and l. 1. ff. de receptato. and he that doth wittingly and willingly receiue such felons, is no lesse capitally punished then they. d. l. 1. ff. de recept:

E. 3. 14. 4.
