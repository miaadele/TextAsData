the penitent sinner entertainment Luke 15.20 21 22 etc. so he arise and come to his father and when he be yet a great way off his father see he and have compassion and run and fall on his neck etc. in all this parable of a godly and religious father and a stubborn and impious son be prefigure and set down the unspeakable love and compassion of God our heavenly father to all his child in jesus Christ which have be rebellious and disobedient before their call in these word be set down two thing viz. first the duty of a penitent sinner second the promotion that the penitent person come unto in the duty of the penitent person there be two thing to be consider first a persuasion of mercy and sure confidence of obtain compassion if he do return imply in the word father as if he shall have say truth it be o father as my life and work have be towards thou I do not deserve to be thy son as in the word follow may appear but yet never the less I be persuade that though I have fail of my duty towards thou yet thou will not fail of thy love to i and although there be no desert of mercy in i yet I know there be compassion for seek for with thou and this be the first ground the penitent person lay to obtain mercy second the penitent person confess his sin whereby he have offend his father for there must be a confession that as the child be to be well persuade of the love of his father so he must be ill persuade of himself in respect of his sin and therefore he say I have sin against heaven and before thou that be against the god of heaven and against thou my natural father and so I have break both the table of the commandment and he confess also he be not worthy to be call a son to so godly a father or to receive mercy that be so full of impiety make himself vile and base in his own eye that he may be high esteem in his father eye which be the first part now for the second part of this text which be the promotion the penitent sinner shall be exalt unto set down in the 22. and 23. verse render a reason wherefore the father do thus promote he the promotion set down be this the father see his riotous and unthrifty son return home with a break and humble heart and with a resolution to become a new man and rather desire his father love then his good he present offer himself to his child and before he can ask for his need he command his servant to bring forth such thing as his penitent son want and to give it before he do crave it for the father see his son so well clothe with humility and with godly remorse for his former life within he will not reject he though he come poor and ragged outward but call for the best robe to cover he the comparison be take from a king and a princelike child who manner be to wear robe and before the son can ask for apparel which he stand in need of the father give he a robe to put on for see he have make himself base in his own eye he will clothe he royal that he may seem precious in his father eye and put a ring on his hand that be he will not only give he thing for necessity but also to adorn and beautify he and as the apostle say upon our uncomely part he will put more comeliness on and shoe on his foot and whereas he come barefooted to his father he command shoe to be put on his foot to keep and preserve they from thorn and stone that may annoy and hurt they and bring the fat calf etc. and whereas he come with a languish stomach for want of meat for before he have be feed among swine now he will refresh he with a tender calf with pleasant and comfortable meat and let we eat and be merry here be cause of mirth and rejoice on both side first on the father side that have lose a untoward son and now have find a obedient son that go from he dead in his sin and return quicken unto the life of grace that depart impenitent and return humble in all which there be cause of mirth and this cause the father render himself to his elder son for my son be dead and be now alive he be lose but be now find etc. second there be cause of rejoice in the son because he go from his father a dead man and now he come to his father a live man he go from he stubborn proud disobedient he return meek penitent and obedient in truth he depart from he a child of Belia^ and return to he the child of God in all which there be great cause of joy on both side and so much for the and order of these word the drift of the parable be that if a godly father have a stubborn and ungodly son that have depart from he and spend his portion among riotous and lewd companion yet if the father shall see his son come home in that manner as be before allege he will receive he again nay he ought in truth to entertain he into his favour again with joy pass by all his stubborn and disobedient behaviour remit all his fault and receive he as his child again notwithstanding all his offence application then the application of this parable be that if the people of God have be apostate revolter rebel and disobedient unto God yet if they will from a plain and a honest heart return to God by true and sound repentance confess their sin with godly sorrow and judge themselves not worthy of mercy then will the lord command his minister (@) put on the rich robe of Christ his righteousness and they shall be adorn with the grace and gift of his spirit and shod with the gospel of peace and give they the flesh and blood of his son and the comfort and joy of the spirit and shall have communion with God in Christ jesus and this will God bestow upon every penitent sinner for if a natural parent can show so much mercy to so ungracious and impious a child when he humble himself unto he that have but a drop of mercy in comparison of the ocean and sea of mercy which be in God how much more will God show mercy unto such penitent and humble sinner that with sense and feel of their sin and want can come to God for mercy and so much for the explication and application of the word and the son say unto he father etc. that be the penitent child say unto his natural father but before we come to gather any doctrine from the very word of the text there arise a doctrine from the dependence of the word in the 17 and 18 verse for when he come to himself and be his own man and be awaken out of his spiritual frenzy than he consider what he may do and begin with this resolution I will go to my father and say etc. he begin to loathe that course of life and now do put that in practice which before he do but purpose and put that in deed which before he have but think in mind from hence arise natural this doctrine doctrine that where there be true repentance there be not only good purpose in the heart that resolution in heart and action in life must go together but also good endeavour and action in the life not only think and say well but also practice and do well this we may see very fit prove unto we in the example of ruth and Orpah both of they purpose a like for both protest to company with Naomie to her own country to serve the god of heaven but Orpah hear the reason against that her purpose return back to serve their idol ruth 1. but ruth have be ground by true repentance to the love of true religion hold on her resolution although her mother in law do bring her sister example as a argument to persuade she to return also but she reply against her mother speech say entreat i not to return for whether thou go I will go and where thou dwell I will dwell thy people shall be my people and thy god my God and what make ruth so good of her word in this respect because she be come to herself and true repentance which make she thus purpose and perform the like we see in Paul when he come to repentance he resolve to leave his blasphemy and persecute of the saint of God and so do he be as good in action as he be in purpose and affection this doctrine be so may also be far confirm by reason draw from the holy scripture of God first because whosoever come to true repentance will have strong reason reason 1 to do well then to do ill and better argument for godliness than he can for sin and wickedness as here we see this prodigal child have and so the church in hosea Hos. 2.7 when the lord meet with they by his judgement and stop the way of enjoy their outward blessing in that abundance which they have before time enjoy and all because they do attribute their plenty to their idol but in their penury and want they have better reason and say I will go and return to my first husband that be to Christ for at that time I be better than now as also in the fourteen chapter when they come to repentance for their idolatry Hos. 14.4 they say neither will we say any more to the work of our hand you be our god for in thou the fatherless find mercy as if they shall have say we will not be so ignorant and sottish any long to think that a idol or carve piece of wood can pity we or show we any compassion for they be but our creature and therefore it argue that they shall rather kneel and bow to we than we to they thus we see their judgement be better inform when they come to repentance than they be before for repentance be a change of the mind as it signify second look what reason man have to purpose well the same reason they have to hold out well the same argument which work good affection in one heart will also hold out to bring forth good action in the life as here the prodigal child three where true repentance be there will be also godly sorrow for it cause repentance 2. cor. 7.10 as the apostle say and where godly sorrow begin these effect will follow first a holy care to leave evil and to practice that which be good second a clear of one self from one sin three it will work a indignation and a holy anger against one sin four a godly fear to commit sin the time ever after five a desire to serve God more and to have a great measure of grace to please he better six a godly zeal of god glory and after the spiritual mean of one salvation and last a holy revenge upon one own self for the sin whereby we have dishonour God and these be the effect of true repentance and to this effect do the apostle james speak cleanse your hand you sinner jam. 9.8 and purge your heart you double mind but they may object how shall we come to this purge and cleanse of both inside and outside he answer they in these word follow suffer affliction and sorrow you and weep let your laughter be turn into mourn and your joy into heaviness as if he shall have say if you will purge your heart from sin and part the sin from the soul you must come to godly sorrow for your sin for the nature of sin be such that it be like a little child it will tarry long there where it be most make of so if we will love and make much of sin we shall have his company but if we will labour to afflict our soul for our sin and sorrow for it we shall quick be rid of it use 1 sith it be so that they that have true repent will not only have good purpose and motion but also good endeavour and good action it serve first for reproof of such person as will have God child to think that they have repent because they purpose to leave their sin they will say they have a purpose to forsake their covetousness to leave their swear sabbath break their drunkenness and such like sin and will proceed no further but ask they wherefore you will have we conceive so well of you that you have repent because we purpose well it be true good motion be to be respect but if they do not bring forth good action they be no better than quaulme and passion that may be in very wicked man and hypocrite for if there be good desire in the heart there will follow certain good endeavour and action in the whole man Saul in a passion will confess to David o my son David thou be more righteous than I and why do he present fall to persecute David again be it not because the spirit of God never convince his conscience of the sin and he never come to godly sorrow for the same and therefore these be but passion which die before they bring forth good action judas also can come to this I have sin in betray innocent blood so far he go well but he can not come to repentance to crave pardon for have he repent he may have be pardon and if he can have believe he shall have be save but do neither he be damn such passion and quaulme have they which in all the haste will go and build upon Christ they do not consider beforehand what charge it will amount unto and whether they be able to undertake so great a building luk. 14.28.29 and therefore have begin they can not proceed but leave off and be not able to finish it so many have sudden flash and passion come into their mind to do good thing but not consider the danger nor charge that one must be at if they purpose to build upon Christ they let their suit fall and their purpose be quick extinct and quench before they come forth to action but these passion the prophet hosea compare to the morning dew Hos. 6.9 o Ephraim what shall I do unto thou o judah how shall I entreat thou for your goodness be like the morning cloud and as the morning dew it go away that be as soon as the sun arise and show forth his beam of light it lick up the dew upon the grass so soon pass your goodness and it be of no continuance of such a nature be all these passion and sudden quaulme that many may have and yet be very sinful and wicked many have these flash when they come to the sacrament and will have these purpose to leave their covetousness their swear sabbath break and all their know and notorious sin and they will also purpose to pray more frequent the exercise of religion more and they will amend many disorder which be amiss if it may be all remedy with thought and purpose but after the sacrament they be as profane and sinful as ever they be before and be never a whit the better in practice and conversation oh before they go to the sacrament they will purpose to make satisfaction to such who they have wrong and to live as friend with they which in time past they have much grieve but let the sacrament be past there be no more hear of satisfaction nor acknowledgement of injury and wrong offer yet we shall have these unconstant man persuade themselves they have repent and will have other so to think and reckon of they but such must know that they have not yet repent till these motion and purpose conceive bring forth good action in life to be practise second it serve for instruction that see true repentance stand in resolve and do therefore if ever we will have any sound comfort to our soul and conscience whensoever the spirit of God have put into our heart good motion and good affection let we follow they hard to bring they to perfection and then we shall be bless in the work as the apostle james speak let we labour to do that which barnabas exhort the faithful brother at Antiochia that with purpose of heart they shall continue in the Lord so let we with all purpose of heart resolve to leave our sin and to practice holy and good duty let we be like unto this prodigal child which do purpose and practice and so we shall have a good testimony to our heart that we have repent oh but I can no soon have a good motion come into my heart but Satan be ready to steal it out and my own corruption to extinguish it before I can bring it forth to action but labour to put in practice these rule which by God grace may help thou to cherish good motion and further they that they come out to practice in thy life and conversation first if we will have our good desire to come to good deed we must labour to come to sound and thorough sorrow of heart for sin past and let we pluck the root of sin up by the weed hook of godly sorrow and then we shall bring forth good action and therefore the apostle james in the place before allege exhort his hearer to purge their heart by godly sorrow for it will break the cord of sin and kill it by degree and to the intent that we may sorrow for sin let we be frequent in meditate of what sin will have do to we namely have kill we for the wage of sin be death and expose we to the everlasting wrath of God also consider that our sin kill jesus Christ the lord of life they be the murderer and betrayer of this just one and whatsoever woe or misery have or can befall we in this present life be the effect of these our sin thus serious ponder of these thing it will procure godly sorrow for sin which godly sorrow will produce good action from good motion second we must bring good reason and argument against our corruption and Satan temptation for if we fall out with the devil and we have not better argument to stand for good duty than he have against they we shall not be able to hold out for if Saul can have have good argument and reason when he pursue and fight against David if he can have consider sure in fight against David I fight against my best friend and my faithful subject yea in so do I shall fight against God and my own salvation etc. then he will never have follow he with such a deadly malice job that faithful servant of God he have good reason to keep he from sin as appear I have make a covenant with my eye job 31.1 2 3. why shall I think on a maid and what portion shall I have of God from above and what inheritance from the almighty from on high be there not destruction to the wicked and strange punishment to the worker of iniquity why do job be so diligent in watch over his sense lest he shall offend his reason be if he shall not have regard to they he know that the lord will not regard he and if he shall have let loose his eye to behold wantonness he know he shall quick lose the favour of God and let his eye take their liberty he shall sudden have taste some misery for he know there be strange punishment for the worker of iniquity oh but who take notice of one thought and look I may let my eye to take their liberty and no man can perceive it nay but job make answer do not God behold my way and tell all my step and although man can take notice of my lustful heart and eye yet the alseeing God do behold it and consider my step which make he not so much as wrong his poor servant he keep for say he if I do contemn the judgement of my servant and of my maid when they do contend with i 13.19 ver. what then shall I do when God stand up and when he shall visit i what shall I answer and the reason why job dare not be froward with his servant because say he he that make i in the womb have he not make he as if he shall have say it may be my servant may be as dear belove of God as I myself and he may be a heir of heaven as well as I at least wise I know we be both his workmanship and therefore I dare not vex and injure he the whole chapter do run upon such argument and reason the three thing to make one constant be when the lord have put into our mind good motion that we delay not but present and quick put they in practice and bring it forth into action as the prodigal child here do for immediate as soon as this come into his mind I will rise and go to my father he delay not but rise and come to his father so the prophet David do find himself out of the way psal 119.60 he say I make have and delay not to keep thy commandment while the wound be green it be best to go to the surgeon and we have a old proverb it be good strike while the iron be hot so when God put into our heart good affection let we quick put they in practice while he warm we with the word and sacrament let we not delay but speedy put it in action and while he speak by affliction let we resolve upon a holy conversation now many when they come to the word and hear of such duty which they ought to practice as for prayer to be perform of every one at the lest both morning and evening the heart be present affect with it and resolve to practice it but so soon as they be go out of the church they defer the put the duty in practice by and by and so those motion die before they come forth into action and all because they do not speedy go about the work for as fire without supply of fuel will quick be extinguish even so the delay of put these good resolution and desire in practice do quick go out and it leave such a deadness and hardness of heart and make one more dull to every good duty wherefore while the heart be warm with any good motion let we speedy put it in practice four to the end we may have all our purpose and desire come to action and true endeavour we must take heed of bad company for they will quick quench the good motion of the spirit that they may never come forth to action for if this prodigal child shall upon this determination have go and tell his companion of this his resolution they will have quick dissuade he from his purpose but he never go to they to take their advice but of himself resolve and do and this the apostle Peter exhort the new convert unto say act. 2.40 save yourselves from this froward generation than they shall be sure to hold out and not be pervert nor our mind alter and change and so much for the first doctrine so he arise and come to his father and say to he father etc. in this confession which the prodigal child do make he begin with that which bring he home even the true consideration that he have a father and the persuasion of mercy if he do return be it as bring he home and so to repentance from hence arise plain this doctrine that the persuasion of mercy be a special doct. 2 mean to work true repentance and sound reformation in we no better a motive to drive we to true repentance than the persuasion of mercy from God for if this prodigal child shall have have this conceit to have come into his brain I will go home but my father will hit i in the tooth of my sin and former behaviour towards he or that it may be he will whip i out of his door or commit i to the house of correction and such like he will never have return home but rather have end his life among the swine then to have go to such a cruel father but the persuasion of mercy drive he home for proof of this doctrine the holy ghost by the author to the Hebrew say for he that come to God must believe that God be and that he be a rewarder of they that seek he he that will come to God and seek he indeed must be persuade to find he in mercy and that he will bestow his love and favour upon he for it be the persuasion of good success that make one go to God and therefore the prophet say psal 130.4 that mercy be with thou that thou may be fear as if he shall have say I shall never have reverence thy name but that there be hope of mercy and grace from thou therefore the devil have no hope of mercy they do not nor can fear the Lord wherefore let we set down this as a main conclusion that if we can have mercy from heaven we shall have mercy from no place the apostle Paul do urge the mercy of God rom. 12.1 to the roman as a forcible argument to serve God I beseech you brother by the mercy of God that you give up your body a live sacrifice holy and acceptable to God which be your reasonable service of God where the mercy of God be a special motive to stir they up to serve God also the prophet Zacharie say I will power upon the house of David and the inhabitant of jerusalem the spirit of grace and prayer and they shall look upon i Zach. 12.12 who they have pierce and they shall lament for he as one mourn for his only son who etc. this will make one turn to Christ when they see their sin so odious as to be the special instrument to wound and kill the lord of life and also when they do consider that Christ give himself for they this infinite love and mercy will move they to true repentance and godly sorrow it be not misery as can convert one to God and turn one from one sin for then the devil may have be convert before this time for they be in anguish and perpetual misery and judas may have repent for he be sensible of horror enough in his conscience but that rather do drive he from God because he can not apprehend the mercy and kindness of God the reason to prove this doctrine be first because till such time one have this persuasion one shall never come to reason 1 true confession which be one part of sound repentance and one will never confess one sin without hope of mercy second because it be unpossible that one shall pray aright without one have this persuasion of mercy and therefore Christ set down this as the foundation of all true prayer our father which art in heaven for we can never have any comfort that our sin be pardon till we can bold go to he in assurance of mercy and though we have fail of our duty towards he yet he will not fail of mercy to we because he be our father sith this be so that the persuasion of mercy be a special mean to stir we up to true and sound repentance it serve for a double reproof of two sort of people use 1 first of those impious beast and monster of the world that if one reprove they for their blasphemy swear sabboth-breaking drunkenness filthiness and such like sin they present have a answer for to cloak it and extenuate it oh but the lord be merciful but to who to such as continue in this impiety no but do thou abuse the mercy and long suffer of God that shall lead thou to repentance and so thereby do harden thy heart in impenitency and do heap up as a treasure unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath that thus on earth add drunkenness to theft these abuse the name of God and it be more fearful to abuse the gospel than the law it be a sin to break the positive law of a prince but more if he stamp under his foot the privy seal of the prince wherein his pardon be write thus disgrace and mock it and yet hope for mercy of he we will count it the part of a madman such be the deal of all such presumptuous wretch they break the positive law of the king of heaven and earth and continue in the breach of the first and second table of the commandment and not only so but abuse the privy signet of God and hope for mercy notwithstanding their ungodliness but such must know that the lord will not be merciful to such but contrariwise the wrath and severity of God for if a father shall use all the duty of kindness to his child and yet he will be very rebellious to his father still and all because his father be love and kind unto he such a child will be quick censure to be a very ungracious and wicked child how much more be such impious and in a high degree ungodly which daily displease God blaspheme his name profane his sabbath etc. and all because God be merciful and gracious but these make a contrary use of the love of God than the prophet Zachary exhort the faithful unto in the place before allege that they shall look upon he who they have pierce and lament but the wicked wretch look upon he and gnash their tooth at he and blaspheme his name and so be make impenitent second it serve for reproof of such who God have afflict with many cross and they see in themselves many sin and much corruption and then upon this they sit themselves down whine and cry and never set forward one foot to go to God for mercy and pardon of their sin and a remove of the cross thus they think there be less mercy in God then be in man for if a godly parent though his child have play the unthrift and rebellious child yet if he will come home with sorrow and humility and acknowledge his fault he will present receive he and show he mercy and yet we can persuade ourselves of the like success with God thus we make god of ourselves and make the merciful God more cruel than man which be most fearful once to think can we forgive the fault and wrong commit one to a other that have but a drop of mercy in comparison of that ocean and sea of mercy and pity in God and shall we not be full assure we shall have pardon and forgiveness of sin if we come to he by repentance let we not dishonour God so high to make God less merciful than mortal man for man have make no promise to remit the wrong and injury offer to he but God have bind himself by covenant yea by oath to pardon the sin and offence commit against he again man can forgive all wrong perfect but he will have some stir and motion in his mind against the party but if we have all the sin of Cain Saul and judas yet if we can come to God with faith in his mercy and godly sorrow and repentance for our sin he will receive we to mercy and give we a general pardon of all our sin and seal it with the blood of the everlasting covenant wherefore let we no long look upon the greatness of our sin but upon the mercy of God which exceed our sin nor on the greatness of our cross but upon the infiniteness of god compassion and kindness and let we resort to he in hope of mercy the second use serve for instruction unto every one that whatsoever our cross be or how many soever our sin be or how great soever our offence be yet let we have a resolution to go to God and we shall find mercy for we be in this case fit subject for his mercy to work upon for mercy please he and he be great please to show mercy to such let we conclude before hand that if we resolve to be true upright christian they we may bold call God father and if we can persuade ourselves we be his child we may believe we shall find mercy at his hand wherefore let we confess our sin and leave our sin and we shall find mercy for if a judge of a assize shall say to a fellow or some malefactor in the gaol if you will confess your theft or trespass and resolve to become a honest man I will pardon your fault and not only so but you shall be make a justice of peace or some great man he will upon this promise be move quick to confess his felony and forego his theft now the judge of all the world offer we this large promise of mercy that if a sinner will true and from his heart confess his sin and resolve to leave they he shall have pardon and not only so but he shall be make a king and priest unto God the father and this preferment we shall come unto if we come unto God in a right manner oh but how may I do to come to be persuade of mercy if I come to God first pray unto God that he will give we his holy spirit which feale unto our heart this persuasion of mercy as the apostle say gal. 4.6 because we be son God have send forth the spirit of his son into our heart which cry abba father the spirit of Christ do work this assurance that God be our father and upon this assurance we shall be force to cry abba father and go to our best father we may be sure to find mercy second we must offer up our soul and body and desire in all thing to serve he and to keep all his commandment than we shall receive mercy from God as that holy man Nehemiah say o lord I beseech thou let thy ear hearken to the prayer of thy servant and to the prayer of thy servant that desire to fear thy name so that if we can but true desire to repent and desire to keep all god commandment and desire to bewail all our sin and to strive against all corruption and it be certain we shall obtain mercy at the hand of God for if a Christian parent command his child to do a thing and if he do it willing and cheerful and though he do it not so perfect as the parent himself yet he will take it in good part because his child endeavour to perform it as well as he can how much more will God our heavenly father accept of the poor desire and endeavour of his child when he see in they a willing desire to do well but if our desire be good and true then there be a use of all good mean and ordinance to accomplish the thing desire or else it be but a slothful desire and it may not be call true a desire else but a lust but if we desire to repent and to believe and also use all good mean to repent and believe and be humble because we can repent and believe as we shall the lord will have mercy upon such holy desire and accept the will for the deed and so much for the second doctrine and when he be yet a great way off his father see he and have compassion and run etc. in all these word be set down the affection and love of the father upon the resolution of his son the son be but come but the father be run he come slow for mercy but the father be ready and forward to show mercy which show the wonderful readiness of God to show mercy to a penitent sinner that come to God for mercy from hence we learn this doctrine doct. 3 that God be very ready to show mercy unto every penitent sinner that come to he with a break and humble heart that a penitent sinner can no soon look for mercy from God but he be ready to show mercy to they that God be more ready to show mercy then penitent sinner can be to seek for mercy this we see in a natural father to his penitent child here now a natural parent have make no such promise to show mercy to his child but our heavenly father have make a promise to every penitent sinner to show he mercy again a natural parent can show mercy and kindness to his child without great cost and labour but our heavenly father he can show mercy without any trouble or charge for it be his name to be merciful now if this be in a natural parent that he will show mercy though he have not promise yea though it be to his great cost and pain how much more will our heavenly father show mercy to his child sith he have promise and be both able and willing with ease to do it if this be in man which have but a drop of mercy in comparison of God what may a penitent soul expect at the hand of God who be infinite in mercy and pity to his this doctrine may very fit be prove by the example of god deal with David that when he have commit two grievous sin of adultery and murder and have almost sleep a twelve month in they in so much that the lord be fain to send a herald of arm to he to awaken he out of his spiritual sleep and to help he out of his sin and to bring he to repentance but the prophet can no soon remember his sin to he but he do immediate confess his sin and he no soon acknowledge and confess his sin 2. sa. 12.13 but the prophet Nathan by the mouth of the lord do pronounce his pardon yea before he do ask it the prophet tell he the lord have put away thy sin and thou shall not die this also we may see prove in that psalm which be entitle David learning wherein the prophet confess when I hold my tongue my bone consume and when I roar all the day that be as long as I do dissemble and seem to cloak and hide my fault I be plague and torment so that roar like a unreasonable beast through pain then I acknowledge my sin unto thou neither hide I my iniquity for I think I will confess against myself psal 32.45 my wickedness unto the lord and thou forgive the punishment of my sin thus we see he can no soon confess but he have pardon both from the guilt and punishment of his sin and he can no soon seek for mercy but he obtain mercy at God hand also the prophet Isay show the mcreie of God unto true repentant sinner where he say Isay 64.5 thou do meet he that rejoice in thou and do just they remember thou in thy way behold thou be angry for we have sin yet in they be continuance and we shall be save where the prophet speak of the lord after the manner of man that he be ready to meet they half way as it be that set themselves in truth and uprightness to confess their sin and meet he by repentance he will meet they swift though they come but soft and though they come heavy yet they shall depart joyful and the same prophet say in the next chapter of the lord before they call I will answer Isay 65.24 and while they speak I will hear this we may see in the prodigal child that before he ask for food clothes and other thing which he stand in need of his father bestow it upon he and before he can make a end of confession of his sin he fall upon his neck and embrace and receive he to favour now there be reason to prove that this doctrine be so reason 1 because it be both the name and nature of God to be merciful and show pity as the prophet micah affirm he retain not his wrath for ever because mercy please he when a man be come true to confess his sin with sorrow than God must needs show mercy to he for mercy please he a small entreaty will persuade a man to do that which he delight in and take pleasure in the do of it even so God be easy draw to show mercy to the penitent sinner because he delight in it and be well please to show mercy oh but how shall I know that I shall receive mercy from he why shall we call it in question if we be penitent for it stand upon his truth and covenant to pardon the sin of the elect and for the certainty thereof he have bind himself by a oath to fulfil it second because over and beside our own prayer to obtain his favour and mercy we have the prayer of Christ our mediator to help we and although the elder brother of this prodigal child do grudge and think much that his father shall show subh kindness to his young brother which have be such a unthrift yet we have our elder brother jesus Christ to make continual intercession unto his father for we and in our behalf now if a natural father can show such mercy to his child when the elder brother speak against he how much more shall our heavenly father show mercy to we when as our elder brother be willing and speak for we and he be as ready to pray for mercy for we as our father can be to give mercy to we sith it be so that God be more ready to offer mercy to penitent sinner than they can be to ask for mercy the use serve first for confutation of the papist use 1 that in their distress and trouble will not go to this merciful God but unto saint and angel for help alack they take a wrong course to forsake this pitiful God who name be to show mercy and who nature be to delight in mercy and run to a saint this be palpable blindness to forsake the creator and receive the creature it be as if one shall forsake to fetch water from the sea where be enough and run to a channel that be dry but if God will not show mercy who will and if he can who can shall we find more mercy from a saint or angel then from the merciful God of who the fatherless find mercy this argue they know not God name for then as the prophet say they that know thy name will trust in thou for thou never fail they that seek thou they be not persuade of this name of God for than they will not seek to saint or angel but unto God who never fail any that seek to he in truth second this serve to show a great deal of corruption in our sinful heart and nature for although we go not in our distress and misery to saint or angel yet we seek unto such as either will not or else can help we and so forsake he where we may always speed and never fail if we seek he with a honest heart and indeed for he will meet we halfeway if he do but perceive in we but a true purpose to come to he one godly tear of true repentance with a faithtfull prayer unto God be able to do we more good and to help we out of our distress than all outward mean of friend money good and such like thing in all this world can do but here be our distrust in God that we have more hope that we shall speed better of our neighbour and friend in time of trouble then of God but this come to pass because we do not assure our heart that he love we in Christ jesus joh. 17.26 according unto Christ prayer that he make for all the elect for if we do we will more depend upon God and less rely upon man more seek to he for help and less trust upon outward thing three it serve for instruction that we shall every one seek unto God chief in all our distress and trouble for to be deliver if one will go to one that be able let we go to God and if we will seek to one that be willing let we seek unto God for there be neither will nor power want in he if we come to he in truth and if we will have mercy from God let we draw near to he with penitent and break heart wash our soul with godly sorrow for sin and then the blood of Christ shall be as water to purge we from all our sin and iniquity whatsoever oh but my sin be so many I dare not go to he but let not that hinder thou from go to he for the more we see our sin and the great burden we feel they the more bold we may be encourage to go to he for mercy for only such be the guest which Christ invite and call and unto who in truth he be send and therefore he say come unto i all that be heavy-laden and I will ease you Matthew 11.28 four sith God be ready to show mercy to every penitent sinner when he come to he and never cast his fault in his tooth let this serve for imitation unto every one of God child that will be say to be like God let they be easy entreat to be reconcile when matter of difference fall out and let we so pardon and forget the wrong and injury offer we that we never upbraid the party in the tooth for the same oh let we never burst out with these speech I will forgive he but I will never forget he or I will never love he again and such like speech but this be to be far unlike God oh but the offence that be offer i be such a great wrong as no man can put it up but be it that it be so great have not you offer God great wrong and yet he have pardon you and will not you forgive he this one wrong that be do to you in truth this argue that you have not taste of the love of God in Christ that can forgive your brother so small a fault but if you will be like God which all his child must resemble in truth if they mean to come to heaven you must labour to remit great wrong and small wrong and all and every one and never upbraid they in their tooth of it but bury it in oblivion and never remember it and so we shall be like to our heavenly father and let we be so far from revenge wrong offer we that we pray for they that hate we and bless they that curse we overcome evil with goodness as we be command and so much for this first doctrine and the son say unto he father I have sin against heaven here be the confession of this prodigal child to his worthy father as if he shall have say truth it be I have sin against the god of heaven in sin against you my natural parent and whereas before I think myself to good to be your child or to remain within your house yet now I change my opinion and think not myself worthy to be son to so good a father and that the worst place in your family be to good for i so untoward a son and so much be to be understand in the 21 verse but in that he confess he sin against God by disobey of his father we learn this doctrine doct. 4 that those which wrong man do sin against God in injure man on earth we sin against the lord in heaven this be prove by the wise man where he say he that mock the poor reproach he that make he pro. 17.15 he that deride the creature do mock the creator and he that contemn the work do by consequence speak against the workman also the apostle prove the same when he say cor. 1.8.12 now when you sin against the brother and wound their week conscience you sin against Christ where the holy apostle show that those offence that be commit against the weak brother do redound to be commit against Christ when they offend the member they sin against the head and therefore Christ say math. 18.6 whosoever shall offend one of those littleone that believe in i it be better for he that a millstone be hang about his neck and that he be drown in the depth of the Sea thus we see that if any offend the least Christian he do offend Christ and shall be severe punish and this Christ will do when he will pass sentence of condemnation against the reprobate I be a hunger and you give i no meat I be thirsty and you give i no drink I be a stranger and you take i not in to you and so forth where for the omit of good duty to be perform to the member of Christ Christ take the omission of duty as do to himself and so a sin do against God the reason to prove this doctrine be reason 1 first because whensoever we wrong man we break the commandment of God and so we must needs sin against God now he command a law of equity that that I will that man shall unto i do I the same unto they and he bid we do good unto all etc. now when we break any of the divine law of God we trespass against God and this make David to cry out psal 51. I have sin against thou against thou only but one may have say David you have wrong Vriah in take his wife away it be true but I have break God law and so sin against God by kill Vriah second in wrong man we sin against God because every man and woman carry the image of God and so wrong the person of man he wrong the image of God and this job do consider well of which do terrify he from wrong his servant as appear by his word what then shall I do when God stand up and when he shall visit i what shall I answer he that have make i in the womb have he not make he have not he alone fashion we in the womb sith that God be offend when man use 1 be wrong it serve first for instruction that we shall take heed how we do wrong any man or woman and not to say I care not for he or she for he be but a base person a man of no account etc. nay but take heed how you injure and wrong he be he never so base in your eye he may be a heir of heaven and a true child of God and at least he carry the image of God in some measure upon he and so you can safe wrong he but you sin against the god of heaven and beside you be forbid to wrong any be they never so base and vile but such person as wrong these base one as they term they dare not wrong a great person because if they shall they may have the law inflict upon they and so thereby be bring into danger as to be cast into prison etc. but to hurt and trouble a poor Christian that they fear not to do but such must know there be as great danger to wrong the poor Christian as in injure the great personage in the world for the wrong do to the member redound to the head and the hurt offer to the poor Christian be a sin against Christ himself and as the prophet Zacharie say Zach. 2.8 he that touch you touch the apple of his eye there be none will endure one to stir or row a thorn or any such like thing in one eye but one shall feel it for there be no place so tender about one as the apple of the eye how much more sensible be God of the injury and wrong offer unto his child and can endure they that thus touch he in so tender a place as to wrong his beloved one such shall be sure to smart for it and if the lord will not have Balaam to wrong his ass much less will he suffer wicked man to wrong his child but many care not what injury they do to other so they can act it cunning and work it subtile that they may not be see or so that the law of the realm will not take hold of they as the wife many time towards the husband she care not what hard speech she give he because there be no human law against she for it but such wife must know that see God be offend when their husband be thus wrong by they they shall not go unpunished unless they repent for God law and precept be violate that command wine to be obedient to their husband in the Lord so many time the husband he wrong his wife in word countenance and sometime in their disorder passion in blow when in truth there be no cause offer he but this argue there be but a little fear of God in he that thus will wrong his own flesh such man little consider when they revile their wife they revile God himself and when they thus wrong they they sin against he for they break his commandment that charge every husband to love their wife as Christ love his church and to to dwell with they as man of knowledge etc. but unless such husband come to true repentance for the injury thus offer to their wife God will sure plague and punish they as a sin do against his majesty so many master which deal cruel towards their servant because they be poor and mean both in parentage and outward friend they care not what wrong they do unto they and how bad they use they but such master must know that in wrong their poor servant they sin against God and howsoever their servant be base in their eye yet they may be member of Christ and heir of heaven or at least he that make you in the womb make he in the womb also and in wrong they you wrong the image of God in they but if they be god servant as well as thou and if they be the child of the almighty than they touch the apple of his eye and better it be a millstone be hang about your neck and that you be cast into the depth of the sea then that you shall offend one of these little one and if Christ will pronounce sentence of condemnation against such at his second come which omit work of mercy to his member how much sore punishment shall such have which wrong and hurt the member of Christ second sith God be offend when man be injure it serve to teach we if we have wrong any either in word or deed whether it be husband to his wife or the wife towards the husband the child to the parent servant towards the master or the superior to the inferior we must not only content ourselves with confess our fault to the party thus wrong but we must also acknowledge it to God who law we have violate and break as David do when he have commit adultery with Bathsheba and kill Vriah against thou thou only have I sin and this David will have do put case that Vriah shall have live he will have first go to God and have confess his fault before he will have go to Vriah though both be require herein many be very faulty for they think if they have fall out with their neighbour and be make friend again they have do enough and they suppose than they may lawful come to the sacrament because they be at peace with man and have get reconciliation with those which they have offend it be true if you have only offend man than it be sufficient if you have do no more but sith there be two person offend the person of God and the person of man therefore there must be reconciliation get of both and the fault must be acknowledge to God as well as to man before we can come prepare to the sacrament at for example if a man rob another by the way side and from he take his purse and by this fact he break not only the law of the king but also the law of God it be not sufficient for the offender to acknowledge the fault to the party rob and pray he forgive he but he must also get his pardon from the king who law he have break or else it may be he may die for his trespass notwithstanding the party rob have forgive he in like manner when we have wrong man we must not only seek to he for to have the wrong remit but also to God who law we have break that he will forgive it and so we must seek for a pardon from God as well as from man or else we be liable to have his judgement execute upon we the want of this duty be the cause why those agreement that be so make up betwixt man and man be so soon break that within two or three day if occasion be offer their hatred be as great again as ever it be and that be because they be at so little pain and so small charge to sue out these pardon whereas if they buy they at a high rate and go to heaven for they by sound repentance confession and godly sorrow they will not be so hasty to fall out with their neighbour again and the neglect of this duty be the cause that many time we have such check and gall in our conscience because we make up these wrong offer so slight we go to man who we have wrong but never to God who we have offend wherefore to avoid all inconvenience which may follow upon this wrong do let we be exhort for the time to come not only to go to man but a so to seek to God for a acquittance for have a pardon from the king we need not fear the arrest of a petty constable or any inferior officer belong to he and so much for the handle of this point and against thou that be against thou my natural parent I confess I have sin from hence we learn doct. 5 that it be not enough to confess our sin unto God but we must also confess they to man so far as we have offend they that know wrong do against man must be acknowledge and confess to man this duty Christ do exhort unto math. 5.23 24. if thou bring thy gift unto the altar and there remember that thy brother have aught against thou leave there thy offering before the altar and go thy way first be reconcile to thy brother and then come and offer thy gift thus we see if any have aught against we that we have do they any manner of wrong we must first and principal go and seek reconciliation for it be fit if we have set a house on fire we shall seek to quench it and put case we have neglect it until we come to the sacrament yet we shall then leave our offering and defer it and return to the party offend and acknowledge the wrong crave pardon for it for God be willing and content that his own service shall wait and stay till that duty be perform and then come and offer thy gift also in a other place Luk 17.3.4 our saviour exhort they to this duty say if thy brother trespass against thou rebuke he and if he repent forgive he and though he sin seven time in a day and seven time in a day return again unto thou say it repent i thou shall forgive he there Christ will have we to be content to forgive wrong if the party offend will return and confess their fault for if they perform their duty to seek reconciliation we must not fail of our mercy to give they remission so far as lie in our power reason to prove this doctrine to be true be these first it be draw from equity reason 1 that he that unlawful have make a wound shall use all lawful mean to heal the wound and he that through passion set the house on fire shall also with discretion labour to quench the fire and he that through folly have wrong his brother must also by wisdom seek to right he again and this the law that be imprint in nature will teach that what we will that man shall do unto we that we shall do unto they if this be practise we shall not so much fall out into distemper passion froward speech and unjust action against one another second if when we have wrong man we will acknowledge the wrong to the party offend it will be the best way to pacify their heart and to make they think well of we and to affect we notwithstanding the wrong do unto they and if we will grieve ourselves because we have grieve they and offend they it will be a special mean to make the party wrong to send up many a hearty prayer unto God for the offendor that he will vouchsafe to forgive he as well as himself and this benefit will confession of wrong do to the party it will make our foe to become our faithful and love friend three if we do use to confess the wrong as soon as we have do a wrong it will make we beware and take heed of commit of wrong again for if the wife have wrong her husband will serious consider what I have wrong my husband and if I purpose to have forgiveness I must not only confess the injury to God but also to my husband this will make the wife ashamed and so by that mean break the neck of sin and it work humility in one soul so that one shall have little lust to fall out and to wrong one again now sith it be not enough to confess and acknowledge the wrong do to man unto God but we must confess it to the party offend it serve first for reproof of such person that come to this point that if they have wrong any one they will confess it to God and so think they have do enough but they must as well perform it to man as well as to God for the plaster ought to go as far as the sore oh but what need there be any confession to man when we have confess it to God for none can forgive sin but God but you must not only repent to God in heaven but also ask forgiveness of man on earth or else the lord will not forgive it for hypocrite may do the one as judas Saul etc. but those which be true upright will perform they both but such as neglect this duty to man as well as perform it to God argue they be in love with their sin and loath to have their nature heal and their sin pardon second it serve for instruction that therefore we shall take heed that we do not wrong any one for this will follow confession and acknowledgement of the fault not only to God but the party offend for until we confess the wrong to the party and get reconciliation with he we must not look God in the face nor can have entertainment to any of God ordinance as the word sacrament prayer for the sacrament be a love feast for the sheep of Christ and not for wraul dog now if the husband have give any angry and churlish speech to his wife whereby she have take they to heart and trouble her mind let he confess the fault to she before he approach never unto God in any of his service so if the wife have wrong the husband the child the parent the servant the master or any one one another let they humble themselves who soever be guilty and acknowledge the fault to the party offend and so get reconciliation or else we can lift up pure hand without wrath as the apostle speak ob. oh but he who I have wrong be not in the country how shall I get reconciliation with he shall I not come to the sacrament and other service till I have confess my fault to he that I know not where he be sol. yes thou may come to the word sacrament prayer and the rest if thou can find in thyself a willing heart to ask forgiveness if he be in the country as also if thou do resolve within thy own soul that if ever the party offend return again into the country thou will perform this duty if this be in thou thou may frequent God ordinance ob. but what if the party offend will be so stubborn that he refuse to be reconcile and will not pardon i though I acknowledge the fault and offer satisfaction for the hurt and wrong commit but do thou the work of the lord sol. and let it not be thy default and then thou shall find mercy of God for he will not deal with we according to the success with the party but according to the uprightness of our heart and in perform our duty let we do the work and then the lord will reward we and so much for this point I be not worthy to be call thy son etc. here be the last duty of this repentant sinner his humility he be well persuade of his father but ill persuade of himself this doctrine we learn from hence that true repentance make one see his own unworthiness the better repentance doct. 6 the more humility they will esteem of God to be great but themselves to be base as we see this prodigal child before there be no place in the family good enough and now there be no place in the house that be bad enough he be not worthy in his own eye to be son to such a godly father this we may see prove out of the example of all holy man when they come to repentance as jacob I be less than the lest of thy mercy Nehemiah ezra Daniel they be ashamed and confound in their face and that shame and confusion of face belong to they job 39.37 and this we may see in holy job when the lord have show he his power and wisdom he answer the lord behold I be vile what shall I answer thou I will lay my hand upon my mouth etc. and in a other place job speak when he come to repentance for all his passionate and distemper word in his affliction job 42.6 I abhor myself and repent in dust and ash and behold God purity he see more evident his own impurity and cause enough to humble and abhor himself for his filthiness and no long to stand out with God in his own innocency and Paul that worthy apostle and servant of God when he come to repentance he confess that he be not worthy to be call a apostle because he persecute the church of God in all which example we see these holy man when they come to repentance they be base and vile in their own eye and see their own unworthiness the reason to prove this doctrine be because repentance open our eye to see more perfect god glorious purity reason 1 and one own vileness and impiety which will so reflect upon we that it will make one low and base in one own eye as may be see in the prophet Isai 6.5 when he cry out woe be i I be undo because I be a man of pollute lip and I dwell in the midst of people of pollute lip where God appear unto the prophet and his majesty be so perfect that it reflect upon he whereby he perceive the more his own vileness and pollution yea even in his best part as his lip which have deliver the message of God very faithful so in truth when we come to see the multitude of our sin and the hainousenes thereof we shall be make quick low enough and be force to cry out with the prodigal child I be not worthy to be call thy son sith it be so that true repentance make we see our own unworthiness use 1 it serve first for reproof of such person which stand upon their own worthiness and goodness they will say they hope they be in as good a case as the best of they all that mourn and confess and keep such a do about repentance and they stand upon it that they deserve to be reckon both with God and man as well as the best of they that go to sermon and they live as well as the best of they all and such speech they be full of but these speech argue that they have not repent but be as yet under the power of sin and in the ready way to damnation for all these be but Pharisaical conceit for he cry out he be not like other man extortioner unjust adulterer or even as this publican etc. but I do this and this and thus boast himself of his own goodness he show himself a most curse person but the poor publican stand not upon his own worthiness but run unto God for mercy and he be so ashamed that he can not look up his eye to heaven but smite his breast say o lord be merciful unto i a sinner I tell you this man depart to his house justify rather than the other thus we see the estate of these boaster that stand upon their own goodness and worthiness whereas a poor sinner that feel his sin do wonder at the goodness of God that shall save such a vile wretch as himself so far be he from boast in himself that he glory in God alone second it serve for consolation unto such which in truth can find their sin out and thereby can perceive their own unworthiness they consider what they be before their call and what they be since they see what original sin have bring upon they blindness darkness deadness hardness of heart and in brief a little devil incarnate which make the poor sinner to cry out that they be not worthy of the least of God mercy they cry out shame and confusion belong to they and with the church it be the lord mercy we be not confound etc. these may comfort themselves for it be a good argument that they have repent and that they have put on a great part of their wedding garment for this be a great part of a christian worthiness to see his own unworthiness and it be certain if we can be base in our own eye we shall be precious in God eye and those which see how vile sin have make they shall be make excellent in the righteousness of Christ these guest be the welcome guest unto the sacrament of the lord supper for these be invite come unto i all that be heavy lade and I will ease you and so much in brief for the handle of this doctrine then the father say unto his servant bring forth the best etc. now the father be so glad of the return of his wander child that he present receive he to favour and have his favour he have all his want supply from hence we learn this doctrine doct. 7 that when we have the favour of God we shall have every thing we stand in need of nothing shall be want when we have god favour love be bountiful and liberal chief in God this David know to be the fountain of all good when he hear they cry out who will show we any good but he cry psal 4 6.7 lord lift up the light of thy countenance upon we thou have give i more joy of heart than they have have when their wheat and wine do abound he have more good by God favour and countenance than the worldling can have in their great plenty of outward thing this make the church in captivity be so earnest in this petition that she repeat it thrice note thereby the excellency of it restore we again o God of host psal 80 and cause thy face to shine upon we and we shall be save so that if God will look upon they with a gracious countenance they shall quick have a riddance of their misery and this the lord himself prescribe as a notable mean to bring prosperity to soul body state etc. 2. Chron 7.14 if my people upon who my name be call upon do humble themselves pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked way then will I hear in heaven and be merciful to their sin and will heal their land when they perform these duty as among the rest to get and obtain my favour then will I show these mercy I will hear as a merciful and heavenly father to deliver they from their trouble and bring they such comfort as they stand in need of use 1 sith it be so that God favour will make supply of all such thing as we need it serve to teach we if we will be furnish thorough with all good thing for our soul and body for this life and a better then let we labour to get peace with God and to seek his favour before all thing for it give true interest to all thing and it will bring all needful thing if a man have the favour but of a earthly prince what outward thing can he want if poor he can make he rich if base yet he will make he honourable if in debt he will discharge it if this be in a mortal man to he that he do favour what may we expect from the favour of the king of king in his favour there must needs be life and prosperity if the favour but of a heathenish king can promote mordecai to such a outward honour and dignity from so base and deject estate that he must have a royal robe and apparel to be clothe withal a gallant steed and horse to be mount upon and a crown of gold upon his head and no base personage to bring all these present to mordecai but by the hand of one of the king most noble prince what shall we have we may conclude that God do favour when mordecai shall have so much when a earthly king do mean to honour it be certain the king of heaven will be far more liberal and bountiful to his favourite than a earthly prince can possible be for he will put upon they the royal robe of Christ righteousness which be the best robe and they shall all be conqueror over all their spiritual enemy and be make king and priest and they shall have all these spiritual grace and gift deliver to they by the king of heaven ambassador the faithful minister of Christ by the word and sacrament and this shall he have who the king of heaven will favour indeed and so much for this doctrine then the father say unto his servant in that the father when he will give any gift to his son do it by the hand of his servant we learn this doctrine doct. 8 that when God do purpose to bestow upon any of his child any save grace or special gift he do it not immediate from his own hand but by the hand of his servant the minister the minister of God be the conduit pipe to convey grace and gift to the child of God I can have time to prosecute this point because the time be pass already and therefore I will leave it and only touch a little of a other doctrine and so we will make a end for this time and the father say bring forth the best robe and put it upon he and put a ring on his finger and shoe etc. in that come to his father with repentance and humility the father give he all thing he stand in need of come ragged he have the best robe put upon he and a ring upon his hand for ornament and shoe etc. from hence we learn this doctrine that whosoever come to God with a humble heart and true repentance doct. 9 shall receive at God hand whatsoever he stand in need of that repentance will get any thing at God hand not only for necessity but also something for delight this may be prove by the word which Christ speak to the church of Laodicea she boast of her plenty when as she be full of penury she think she have all thing when she want all good thing yet Christ promise she if she will come to he he will furnish she with all good thing and if she will receive his council he will deck she with the rich jewel and therefore he say Reu. 3.17.18 I council thou to buy of i gold try by the fire that thou may be make rich and white raiment that thou may be clothe and that thy filthy nakedness may not appear and anoint thy eye with eye salve that thou may see etc. now in buy and sell there must be somewhat give and receive now therefore she must sell her sin by repentance and godly sorrow and she must esteem of the favour of God and grace of Christ in lieu thereof and this be do she shall receive in steed of her poverty the riches and grace of Christ and his spirit and in stead of her filthiness she shall have the white raiment and righteousness of Christ to cover she and all her wickedness and infirmity shall be take from she and whereas she be blind that shall be remove and her eye shall be open and her understanding enlighten by the spirit of wisdom and knowledge but what need I go from my text to prove this that when we come to true repentance we shall have all good thing bestow upon we for here the father command the servant to fetch out the best robe now all the robe that be in God wardrobe be all best robe for the thief upon the cross that die with Christ and repent and believe in he have one of the best robe as well as Abraham jacob or any of the patriarch and they be all long robe not scant but cover and hide all our filthiness with the kingly robe and shine garment of Christ and he will not content himself to give he a robe but he will also put a ring upon his hand for ornament so the lord will deck and adorn every true repentant sinner with the comely grace and virtue of his spirit and whereas he come barefooted and surbate with travel he put shoe upon his foot so the lord when one come to he by true repentance he will bestow upon he the shoe of the preparation of the gospel of peace that he may be able to walk through all rough and hard way yea the shadow of death and shall not be hurt and whereas he come home with a languish soul for want of food the father call for the fat calf and the best cheer he have he bestow upon he so the lord bestow upon the penitent sinner the best diet and banquet many time earthly father have it not ready wherewith they may entertain their child but God have it always in a readiness a feast of fat thing even a feast of fine wine and fat thing full of marrow of wine fine and purify even the body and blood of Christ for God the father make the feast jesus Christ be the matter of the feast and the holy ghost the applier of it now in the sacrament the worthy receiver receive all these thing and all needful thing shall be supply unto they thereby for if the eat of one fruit which be forbid we bring such a universal misery upon all the posterity of Adam how much more may we be persuade that the eat of the bread and the drink of the wine in the sacrament which be command will bring a more happy estate to the worthy receiver they the other lose for this meat will not only nourish we but cure we also the elder brother which be to be understand of the jew he be angry and repine at the kind deal of his father towards his young brother but now our elder brother Christ jesus be well please with every penitent sinner which come to his father and make intercession for they and if a earthly parent will thus love a young son which have be a lewd and riotous companion how much more will our heavenly father entertain every penitent person that come to the sacrament of the body and blood of Christ with resolution to cleave unto God they shall be sure to have supply of whatsoever grace they stand in need of so also the father rejoice and they be merry that his wander son be return home again and therefore the father make a feast first God the father make a feast for every penitent sinner and he rejoice to see a sinner to return to he jer. 32 41. for he delight to do such good also Christ himself rejoice to see such as convert unto he for it be meat and drink for he to do his father will and the angel in heaven do both desire and rejoice at the conversion of a sinner Luke 15.7 and not only so but all the saint and church of God that hear of the conversion of a sinner and addition to the church will magnify God and rejoice upon it second there will be a feast of joy to the party convert when he see a wretched creature to come to the feast of God that before be eat with swine he now come to feast with God the whole Trinity before to feed upon swinish meat and now to eat no worse than the body and blood of Christ by faith in the sacrament and to afford we these benefit first thereby to be purge from our sin through the blood of jesus Christ and second to receive strength and increase of grace as faith repentance love and other save grace more and not only spiritual gift but also temporal for body state name and every thing that be needful for we in every point according to the covenant which the lord have make in Ezechiel 36.25 etc. and if we can come to the sacrament with true feel and see the want of grace and also be pain with carry such a load of sin we may be assure to be disburden of the one and our want supply in the other and so we shall be make fit guest for the lord supper use 1 sith it be so that whoso ever do come to God with true repentance and resolution to cleave fast unto he shall have as much as he stand in need of it serve for encouragement to poor penitent sinner that have commit many and great sin that they shall come to God and make their moan unto he that he will vouchsafe to pardon all their sin and give they such grace whereby they may be assure of his favour for certain if we come with repentance and resolve to become new man and to stick close unto he we may expect to receive at his hand every thing which we stand in need of other must be entreat before they will do any thing but God will give before we ask yea he will meet a penitent sinner half way if they will but look towards he he will run towards they with mercy oh but I never look to live in credit again and to have a merry day my misery be so many indeed if you purpose to keep your sin you must be sure to keep your sorrow but if you will come to true repentance and seek unto God he can and will supply all your want and whatsoever cross and loss you have sustain he be able to make up your break estate heal your name and set you in as great prosperity again as ever you enjoy for he make poor and make rich and prosperity come from he and he give to all and hit none in the tooth God have in his wardrobe all kind of apparel ready make if we seek unto he and there be no soul so thirsty after the grace of God but if we come in humility to he he will give they the sweet grace of his spirit to quench they wherefore let we put out all carnal doubt and worldly care and set ourselves to perform our duty and we undoubted be persuade to find his mercy for he that bid we forgive our brother scutcheon time seven time if they seek unto we much more will God forgive we all our sin whatsoever be they never so many nor never so great if we seek unto he by true repentance and acknowledgement of they with grief and sorrow if he will seek Paul when he be go to Damascus to persecute the member of Christ and show he mercy how much more will he show compassion to such which now have desist from persecute of the sain and commit of other sin and labour to seek God by true repentance and a full resolution to serve he in truth and to conclude if God will call for Adam when he run from from he to hide himself and all to give he the pardon of his sin which he unhappy have commit how much more will he give all thing unto they both temporal and spiritual which with a honest heart seek unto he by true repentance and godly sorrow for their sin for if he be so ready to show mercy to such which never seek for it he will be more ready to give mercy to such as in truth perform this doctrine the time be past let we here make a end for this time
