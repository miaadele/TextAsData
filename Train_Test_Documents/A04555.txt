broad plain whereon stand a brazen pillar whereat seven several way divide which cause the seven knight to forsake each other company and to take every one a contrary way where we leave six of the champion to their content travail and whole discourse upon the fortunate success of our worthy english knight who after some few month travail happy arrive within the ^eretories of Egypt which country as then be great annoy with a dangerous d^^gon but before he have journey full the distance of a (@) the silent night approach and solitary stil^es take possession of all live thing at last he espy (...) wherein he purpose to rest his ho^se and to take so^e repast after his weary journey till the (@) have renew his morning light that he may f^^l to (@) travail again but enter the cottage he find (@) hermit overwear with year and almost consume with grief to who he beg^n in this manner to confer father say he for so you seem by your gravety may a traveller for this night crave entertainment within your cottage not only for himself but his horse or be there some city near at hand whitherto I may take my journey without danger the oldman start at the sudden approach of saint George reply unto he in this order sir knight quoth he of thy country I need not demand for I know it by thy burgonet for indeed thereon be grave the arm of England but I sorrow for thy ^ard fortune that it be thy destiny to arrive in this our country of Egypt wherein be not leave sufficient alive to bury the dead such be the distress of this land through a dangerous and terrible dragon now range up and down the country which if he be not every day appease with a pure and true virgin which he devour down his venomous bowel but that day so neglect will he breathe such a stench from his nostril whereof will grow a most grievous plague and mortality of all thing which use have be observe for these four and twenty year but now there be not leave one true virgin but the king only daughter throughout Egypt which damsel to morrow must be offer up in sacrifice to the dragon therefore the king have m^de proclamation that if any knight dare prove so adventurous as to combat with the dragon and preserve his daughter life shall in reward have she to his wife and the crown of Egypt after his dis^^ase this large proffer so encourage the english knight that he vow either to redeem the king daughter or else to lose his life in that honourable enterprise so take his repose and nightly rest in the old man hermitage till the cheerful cock be the true messenger of day give he warn of the sun uprise which cause he to bu^kle on his armour and to furnish his steed with strong habiliment of war the which be do he take his journey guide only by the old hermit to the valley where the king daughter shall be offer up in sacrifice but when he approach the sight of the valley he espy a far off a most fair and beautiful damsel attire in pure arabian silk go to sacrifice guard to the place of death only by s^ge and modest matron which woeful sight so encourage the english knight to such a forwardness that he think every (@) a day till he have redeem the damsel from the dragon tyrran^e so approach th^ lady give her comfort of delivery and return she back to her father palace again after this the noble knight like a bold adventurous champion enter the valley where the dragon have his residence who no soon have a fight of he but he give such a tir^able y^ll as though it have thunder in the ^llements the bigness of the dragon be fearful to behold for betwixt his shoulder and his tail be fifty foot in distance his scale glister bright than silver but far more hard than brass his belly of the colour of gold but more big than a Tun. t^us welter he from his hideous den and fierce assail the study champion with his burn wing that at the first encounter he have almost fall he to the ground but the knight nimble recover himself give the dragon such a thrust with his (@) t^at it shiverd in a thousand piece whereat the furious dragon so fierce smite he with his venomous tail that down fall man and horse in which fall two of saint George rib be sore bruise but yet step backward it be his chance to leap under a Orringe tree which tree have such precious virtue that no venomous worm dare come within the compass of the branch nor within seven foot thereof where this valiant knight rest himself until he have recover his former strength who no soon feel his spirit revive but with a eager courage smite the burn dragon under his yellow burnish belly with his trusty sword Askalon whereout come such abundance of venom that it sprinkle upon the champion armour whereby immediate through the empoison strength of the venom his armour burst in twain and the good knight fall into a grievous and dead sound that for a time he lay breathless but yet have that good memory remain that he tumble under the branch of the Orringe tree in which place the dragon can proffer he no further violence the fruit of the tree be of such a excellent virtue that whosoever taste thereof shall present be cure of all manner of disease and infirmity whatsoever so it be the noble champion good and happy fortune a little to recover through the virtue of the tree and to espy a Orringe which a little before have drop down wherewith he so refresh himself that he be in short time as sound as when he first begin the encounter then kneel he down and make his divine supplication to heaven that God will send he for his dear son sake such strength and agility of body as to slay the furious and tirrable monster which be do with a bold and courageous heart he smite the dragon under the wing where it be tender without scale whereby his good sword Askalon with a easy passage go to the very hilt through both the dragon heart liver bone and blood whereout issue such abundance of purple gore that it turn the grass which grow in the valley into a crimson colour and the ground which before parch through the burn stinch of the dragon be now drench with overmuch moisture which void from his venomous bowel where at last through want of blood and long continuance in fight the dragon yield his vital spirit to the mercy of the conquer champion the which be happy perform the noble knight saint George of England first yield due honour to almighty God for the victory then with his good sword Askalon he cut off the dragon head and pitch it upon the truncheon of a spear which at the begin of the battle he shiver against the dragon scaly back during this long and dangerous combat his trusty steed lie altogether in a sound without any move which cause the english champion with all speed to crush the juice of a Orringe into his cold mouth the virtue whereof present expel the venomous poison and recover his former strength again there be as then remain in the egyptian court one Almidor the black king of Morocco who long have prosecute in the way of marriage the love of Sabra the king daughter but by no policy mean nor manhood can he accomplish what his har^ desire but now find opportunity to express his treacherous mind intend to rob and spoil saint George of his victory whereby he think to attain the gracious favour and singular g^^d like of his lady and mistress who loathe his company like the detest crokadile but even as the wolf though all in vain bark at the moon so this fantastical and cowardly Almidor through many rich gift and fair promise hire twelve egyptian knight to beset the valley where saint George slay the burn dragon and by force bereave he of his conquest but when this magnanimous champion of England come ride in triumph from the valley aspect to have be entertain like a conqueror with drum and trumpet or to have hear the bell of Egypt ring a joyful sound of victory or to have have see the str^etes beautify with bonfire but contrary to his imagination be he meet with troop of arm knight not to conduct he peaceful to the egyptian court but by falsehood and treachery to despoil he of his life and honour for ne soon have he ride past the entry of the valley but he espy how the egyptian knight brandish their weapon and divide themselves to intercept he in his journey to the court by which he know they to be no faithful friend but vow enemy so tie his horse to a hatkorne tree he intend to try his fortune on foot for fear of disadvantage they be twelve to one but in the skirmish saint George so valiant behave himself with his trusty sword Askalon that at one stroke he slay three of the egyptian knight and before the golden diamond of heaven have wander the zodiac th^ compass of a hour but some he dismember of thei^ head some have their limb lop off some their body cut in twain and some their entrails trail down so that not one be leave alive to carry news to Almidor the black king which stand during all the time of skirmish a far off upon a mountain top to behold the success of his hire champion but when he see the egyptian bloody tragedy and how the happy fortune of the english knight have win the honour of the day he accurse his destiny and accuse the queen of chance with cruelty for disappoint his pretend enterprise but have a heart fraught with all wicked motion secret vow in his soul to practice by some other treachery s. George utter confusion so ^unning before to the court of king Ptolemy not reveal what have happen to the twelve egyptian knight but ^rying in every place as he go Victoria the enemy of Egypt be slay then Ptolemy command everse street of the city to be hang with rich Ar^as and imbrothere^ tapestry and likewise provide a sumptuous chariot of gold the wheel and other timb^^ work of the pure ebony the cover thereof be make of purple silk cross b^rde with sta^es of gold likewise a hundred of the noble peer of Egypt attire in crimson velvet and white mount on milk white courser with rich caparison attend the come of s.

return to the adventure of the other christian champion chap. 5 the tyr^ible battle betwixt s. Anthony the champion of I^alie and the giant Blanderon and afterward of his strange entertainment in the giant castle by a thracian lady and what happen to he in the same castle it be at that time of the year when the earth be new deck with a summer livery when the noble and heroical mind champion saint Anthony of Italy arrive in Thracia where he^ spend his seven year travail to the honour of his country the glory of God and to his own last memory for after he have wander through many a wear^^some way both by sea and land through wood and wilderness by hill and dale by cave and den and other unknown passage he arrive at last upon the top of a high and steeple mountain whereon stand a wonderful huge and strong castle which be keep by the most mighty giant under the cope of heaven who puissant force all Thracia can not overcome nor once attempt to withstand but with the danger of their whole country the giant name be Blanderon his castle of the pure marble stone his gate of yellow brass and over the principal gate be grave in letter of gold these verse follow within this castle live the scourge of king a furious giant who unconquered power the thracian monarch to subjection bring and keep his daughter prisoner in his Tower seven damsel fair the monstrous giant keep that singe he music while he right sleep his bat of steel a thousand knight have feel which for these virgin sake have lose their life for all the champion bold that with he deal this most intestive giant still survive let simple passenger take heed in time when up this steepy mountain they do climb but knight of worth and man of noble mind if any chance to travail by this tower that for these maiden sake will be so kind to try their strength against the giant power shall have a virgin prayer both day and night to prosper they with good successful fight after he have read what be write over the gate desire of fame so encourage he and the thirst of honour so embolden his valiant mind that he either vow to redeem the lady from their servitude or die with honour by the fury of the giant so go to the castle gate he strike so vehement thereon with the pummel of his sword that it sound like a mighty thunder clap whereat Blanderon sudden start up be fast a sleep close by a fountain side and come pace forth at the gate with a mighty oak upon his neck which at the fight of the italian champion so light flourish it about his head as though it have be but a light dimmilaunce and with these word give the noble champion entertainment what fury have incense thy over bolden mind proud princock thus to adventure thy feeble force against the violence of my strong arm I tell thou have thou the strength of Hercules who bear the mountain Atlas on his shoulder or the policy of Ulysses by which the city of Troy be ruinate or the might of Xerxes who multitude drink huge river as they pass yet all too feeble weak and impudent to encounter with the mighty giant Blanderon thy force I esteem like a blast of wind and thy stroke as light as a few drop of water therefore betake thou to thy weapon which I compare unto a bulrush for on this ground will I measure out thy grave and after cast thy feeble palfrey in one of my hand headlong down this strep^e mountain thus boast the vain glorious giant upon his own strength during which time the valorous and hardy champion have alight from his horse where after he have make his humble supplication to the heaven for his good sp^ede and commit his fortune to the impartial queen of destiny he approach within the compass of the giant reach who with his great oak so nimble besturde he with such vehement blow that they seem to shake the earth and to rattle against the wall of the castle like mighty thunder clap and have not the politic knight continual skip from the fury of his blow he have be bruise as small as flesh unto the pot for every stroke that the giant give the root of his oak enter at the least two or three foot deep into the ground^ but such be the wisdom and policy of the worthy champion not to withstand the force of his weapon till the giant grow breathless and not able through his long labour to lift the oak above his head and likewise the heat of the sun be so intolerable by reason of the extreme height of the mountain and the mighty weight o^ his iron coat that the sweat of the giant brow run into his eye and by the reason that he be so extreme fat he grow blind that he can not see to endure combat with he any long and as far as he can perceive will have retire or run back again into his castle but that the italian champion with a bold courage assail the giant so fierce that he be force to let his oak fall and stand gasp for breath which when the noble knight behold with a fresh supply he redouble his blow so courageous that they batter on the giant armour like a storm of winter ha^le whereby at last Blanderon be compel to ask the champion mercy and to cra^e at his hand some respite of breathe but his demand be in vain for the valiant knight suppose now or never to obtain the honour of the day and therefore never rest his weary arm but redouble blow after blow till the giant for want of breath and through the anguish of his deep gash wound be force to give the world a farewell and to yield the riches of his castle to the most renown conqueror s. Anthony the champion of Italy but by that time the long and dangerous encounter be finish and the giant blanderon head dissever from his body the sun sit mount on the high part of the element which cause the day to be extreme hot and sulthie whereby the champion armour so extreme scald he that he be constrain to unbrace his corselet and to lay aside his burgonet and to cast his body on the cold

chapter chap. 7 how saint Andrew the champion of Scotland travail into a vale of walk spirit and how he be set at liberty by a go fire after his journey into Thracia where he recover the six lady to their natural shape that have live seven year in the likeness of milkwhite swan with other accident that befall the most noble champion now of the honourable adventure of saint Andrew the famous champion of Scotland must I discourse who seven year travail be as strange as any of the other champion for after he have depart from the brazen pillar as you hear in the begin of the history he travail through many a strange and unknown nation beyond the cercuit of the sun where but one time in the year she show her brightsome beam but continual darkness overspread the country and there be a kind of people that have head like dog and in the extremity of hunger do devour one another from which people this noble champion be wonderful strange deliver or after he have wander some certain day neither see ^he gladsome brightness of the sun nor the comfortabl^ countenance of the moon but only guide by dusky paleness of the element he happen to a vale of walk spirit which he suppose to be the very dungeon of burn A^^aron for there he hear blow of unseen fire boil of furnase rattle of armour trample of horse g^^^ling of chain l^mbring of tub roar of spirit and such like horrible hear that it make the scottish champion almost at his wit end but yet have a undaunted courage exempt all fear he humble make his supplication to heaven that God will deliver he from that discontent place of terror and so present as the champion kneel upon the barren ground whereon grow neither herb flower grass nor any other green thing he behold a certain flame of fire walk up and down before he whereat he grow into such a ecstasy of fear that he stand for a time amaze whether it be best to go forward or to stand still but yet recall his sense he remember himself how he have read in pass time of a go fire call the fire of destiny or some will with the wisp or will with the lantern and likewise by some simple country people the fair maid of Ireland which common use to lead wander traveller out of their way the like imagination enter the champion mind so encourage himself with his own conceit and cheer up his dull sense late oppress with extreme fear he direct follow the go fire which so just go before he that by the time the guider of the night have climb twelve degree in the zodiac he be safe deliver from the vale of walk spirit by the direction of the go fire now begin the sun to dance about the firmament which he have not see in many month before whereat his dull sense so much rejoice be so long cover before with darkness that every step he tread be as pleasurable as though he have walk in a garden bedeck with all kind of fragrant flower at last without any further molestation he arrive within the territory of Thracia a country as you hear in the former chapter adorn with the beauty of many fair wood and forest through which be travail with small rest but less sleep till he come to the foot of the mountain whereupon stand the castle wherein the woeful king of Thrace in company of his sorrowful subject still lament the unhappy destiny of his six daughter turn into swan with crown of gold about their neck but when the valiant champion saint Andrew behold the lofty scittuation of the castle and the invincible strength it seem to be of expect some strange adventure to befall he in the say castle so prepare his sword in readiness and buckle close his armour which be a shirt of silver mail for lightness in travail he climb the mountain whereupon he espy the giant lie upon a craggy rock with limb and member all to be rend and tear by the fury of hunger starve fowl which loathsome spectacle be no little wonder to the worthy champion consider the mighty stature and bigness of the giant so leave his putrefy body to the wind he approach the gate where after he

of four beautiful damsel which wrap the drowsy champion in a sheet of the fine arabian silk and convey he into a cave direct place in the middle of the garden where they lay he upon a soft bed more

Hungary of all other country both in Africa and Asia then be the rich and plentiful of victual to maintain a camp of man yet be it mighty overpress and great burden with multitude not only with want of necessary to relieve soldier but with extreme cruelty of those bloody mind miscreant that through a civil discord which happen amongst they abou^ the ^lection of a general they convert their unity to a most inhuman slaughter and their triumphant victory to a dismal bloody tragedy for no soon ar^^ed their legion upon the plain of Algernos b^eing in length and breadth one and twenty L^agues but

likewise from the province of Prester John three hundred thousand of unconquered knight with many other petty dominion and dukedom who number I omit for this time lest that I shall seem over tedious to the reader but to conclude such a camp of arm soldier arrive in Hungary that may in one month have destroy Christendom have not God defend they from those barbarous nation and by his invincible power confound the pagan in their own practice for no soon have the Harrolds proclaim through the camp what number of nation join their band together but the soldier fall at dissension one with

mighty Mahomet who have provide whip of burn wire to scourge you for your cruelty proffer against his bless worshipper and now with this deadly curse I bid you all farewell the plague of Egypt light upon your kingdom the curse of Cain upon your child the famine of jerusalem upon your friend and the misery of Oedipus upon yourselves this wicked resolution and baleful curse be no soon end by the desperate mind almidor but the impatience of saint George be so high move that he give present commandment to the appoint executioner to cast he into the boil cauldron which incontinent they perform to the terror of all the beholder to behold this wofulll spectakle the battlement of temple we^e so throng with people the house cover with woman and child and the street fill with arm soldier that it be a wonder to behold among which multitude there be some particular person that at the sight of almidor death fall down and break their neck but the general number as well of pagan as christian cry with cheerful voice honour and victory follow saint George of England for he have redeem Barbary from a miserable servitude which joyful hear so delight the seven champion of Christendom that they cause the conduit to run with wine the street to be beautify with bonfire and a sumptuous banquet to be proclaim through the city which after continue for the space of seven day in more magnificent royalty than the banquet at Babylon when the macedonian monarch return from the world conquest the champion liberality procure such faithful lo^e in the heart of the Morocco Pieres that with a general consent they choose saint George for their lawful king where after they have invest he in the princely seat of the Morocco potentate they set the crown upon his head and after present he with a imperious pall which the king of Barbary usual wear upon their coronation day protest to forsake their profane religion and (@) christen in the faith of Christ this promise conversion of the infidel more delight the english champion than to have the whole world honour at command for it be the chiefee point of his knightly oath to advance the faith of Christ and to enlarge the bound of Christendom after his coronation be solemn perform the other six champion conduct he to a princely palace where he take the true allegiance of the Morocco lord by plight oath to be true to his crown after this he establish christian law to the benefit of the whole country then he command all the ceremonious rite of Mahomet to be tread under foot and the true gospel of Christ to be preach likewise he cause all that do remain in barbary to be christen in the new faith but these observation continue but a time as shall hereafter shall be discourse at large for fame not intend to let the worthy champion long to remain in the idle bower of peace but summon they to persevere in their noble achievment and t^ muster up a new their soldier who armour canker ease have almost stain with rust therefore saint George commit the government of his country to four of the principal pear of Morocco and march towards the country of Egypt where live treacherous Ptolemy the father of his belove lady Sabra who he have leave in the kingdom of England in which journey and happy arrival in Egypt w^ will leave the seven champion for a time and speak of the faithless infidel in barbary after the departure of the christian who former honour they slight regard for no soon have saint George with his martial troop bid their country adieu but the faithless moor reconcile themselves to their former god and purpose a speedy revenge for the death of Almidor against all christian that remain within the limmet of that heathen nation for there be many soldier wound in the late battle likewise a number oppress with sickness have the christian champion leave behind for their better recovery upon who the barbarous moor commit their first tyranny for they cause the distress soldier to be draw upon ^lids to the outermost part of the city and there put they into a large and old monastery which they present set on fire and most inhumane burn the christian soldier and after convert the place into a filthy leastall many woman and succourless child they drag up and down the street till their brain be dash against the stone and the blood have cover the earth with a purple hue many other cruelty be commit by the wicked infidel against the distress christian which I purpose to pa^^e over and whole discourse of the woeful and bloody murder of a english merchant and his wife in the same city of Tripoli the report whereof may force the merciless tiger to relent and those eye to shed a spring of tear that never weep before the bloody mind Negars violate both oath and promise before plight to saint George by violence set upon the merchant house where first they make a massacre of his servant and before his face cast their dead body to hunger starve dog then come to the merchant they bind he fast with hempen cord to the strong post in his house and after take his child be seven of the goodly boy that ever nature ^^amed and likewise tie round about he then one of the moor be cruel than the rest proffer to deflower the merchant wife before his face but she in chastity like Camma choose rather a honourable death than a infamous life spit in the negars face and most bitter revile he yield neither to his force nor his bloody threat but snatch a knife from his girdle vow to sheathe it in her bosom before she will lose that precious gem of honour that once be go can be recover for all the world treasure this resolution of the english merchant wife cause the stern Negars to exceed in cruelty but the principal of that wicked company be a bloody and merciless tyrant stab one of the silly child before the mother face now stubborn dame quoth he will thou yield to my desire and preserve the life of thy other six child otherwise shall thou behold they butcher in the same manner to sell my honour for the life of my child reply she will be a offence to God and a continual corrosive to my husband heart if we live together therefore accurse monster prosecute your tyranny it be not all your threat and bloody deal shall convert my chaste mind nor once enforce my thought to give any consent thereunto these word be no soon end but the lustful Moor take a other of her child and stabed before h^r husband face think thereby to before the merchant to entreat his wife to consent to the wicked n^gars determination but he be as resolute as his virtuous wife speak in this manner o you curse black dog of barbary more worse in quality than the bloody tiger and more merciless than the wicked cannibal think you that the murder of our child shall enforce our heart to yield to your lustful desire n^ no persevere in your tyrrany if I have a hundred child twice the number of king Priam yet will I lose they all before I will endure to see my wife dishonour child may be get again but her honour never recover these word prick the Negars to the gall and cause they to commit the wicked deed that ever be practise under the celestial globe of heaven first they sheathe there poniard in the breast of all the merchant child who guiltless blood stay all the chamber with a crimson colour then with there falchion do they cu^ there body all in sunder and cause seven p^es to be make of there flesh and after serve in a banquet to there woeful parent who the merciless moor set at a square table the merchant place direct opposite against his wife where they be constrain either to feed upon there own child or starve for want of other sustenance this woeful spectacle strike such a grief into the english merchant heart that he can scarce endure to speak for weep his wife when she behold the head of her lovely son lie upon the table as it be look to heaven for revenge breathe fort^ this woeful die lamentation o silly babe I will you have be strangle in my womb at your first conception then shall not these accurse infidel have triumph thus in your ^nhappie tragedy nor your unfortunate parent beh^ld this luckless day whereon I pray that never s^nne may shine again but be account a ominous day throughout the whole earth for heaven I hope poor babe will reign a shower of vengeance on their head that have cause this your untimely death and with this prayer I bite the world^ farewell at which word her grief so exceed the bound of reason that it stay the passage of her speech whereby she be force to yield her soul to the paradise of peace she be no soon dead but the sorrowful merchant likewise biter exclaim against the injustice of fortune and the tyranny of the barbarous moor account his destiny more ha^les than the thracian king that bury his child in his own bowel and the cruelty of the infidel to exceed the tyranny of Nero that cause his mother womb to be open that he may behold the place of his creation but when the merchant have sufficient bewail the murder of his child the death of his wife and his own misery he yield his soul likewise to the furious stroke of death the end of who long languishment when the wicked moor have intelligence they cause their dead body to be carry to the top of a hi^h mountain and there leave for the pray of hungry raven but God most miraculous preserve they both from the fury of fowl and the violence of ravenous beast for the su^ consume their body like the morning dew and by the w^nderfull workmanship of heaven in the s^me place spring a bower of rose to signify the unspotted honour of the merchant and his virtuous wife which miracle we leau^ to the wonder of the moor and speak of the christian champion proceed that by this time be arrive in the kingdom of Egypt chap. 15 how the christian arrive in Egypt and what happen to they there the tragedy of the lustful earl of Coventrie how Sabra be bind to a stake to be burn and how saint George redeem she last how the egyptian king cast himself from the top of a tower and break his neck during the time of the bloody murder wrought by the barbarous moor upon the english merchant and his wife with his seven child as you hear in the former chapter the champion of Christendom arrive upon the territory of Egypt where they suppose to have meet with legion of arm soldier and to have adventure their life upon the chance of war but all thing fall out contrary to their expectation for they find the gate of every city set open and every village and town unpeople for the at the report of the christian arrival secret hide their treasure in the cave of the earth in deep welles and such like obscure place and a general fear and extreme terror assail the egyptian as well the peer of the land as the simple country people many flee into wood and wilderness and close hide themselves in hollow tree many dig cave in the ground where they think best to remain in safety and many flee to high mountain where they long tim^ live in great extremity feed upon the grass of the ground so great the egyptian fear the army of christian that they expect nothing but the ruin of their own country with the loss of their own life and the murder of their wife and child but to speak of the christian champion who find the country desolate of people suspect some deep policy of the egyptian think they to have muster their general force to bid they battle therefore saint George give commandment through the whole camp that not a man upon pain of death shall break his rank but march advise with three weapon ready press to enter battle as though the enemy have direct place themselves opposite against they which special charge the christian soldier due observe look neither after the wealth of city nor the spoil of village but circumspect march according to their leader direction along the country of Egypt till they approach the sight of king Ptolemy court which when the noble champion of England behold in this manner encourage he his follower behold say he you invincible captain of Christendom yonder curse tower where wicked Ptolemy keep his court those battlement I say be they as rich build as great pyramid of Greece yet shall they be subvert and lay as level with the ground as the city of Carthage there have that accurse Ptolemy hy^ residence that for preserve his daughter from the burn dragon treacherous send i into Persia where for seven year I live in great extreamie in a dismal dungeon where the sun do never lend i light nor the company of people comfort in revenge whereof my heart shall never rest in quiet till I see the building of his palace set on fire and convert into a place of desolation like ^o the glorious city in Phrigia now overspread with^ stink weed and loathsome puddle therefore let a^ Christian soldier that fight under the banner of Christendom and all that love George of England your choose general draw forth their warlike weapon and like the angry greek overturn these glister battlement leave not one stone upon another but lay it as level with the ground as the harvest reaper ^at the field of ripen corn let your wrathful fury fall upon these tower like drop of April shower or like a storm of winter hail that it may be bruit through the world what lustful vengeance do light upon the pride of Egypt leave not I say as ^ou love your general when you have subvert the palace not one man alive no not a suck babe but let they suffer vengeance for the wickedness of their King this be my decree brave knight of Christendom therefore march forward heaven and fortune be your good speed at which word the soldier give a general shout in sign of their willing mind then begin the s^^ken streamer to flourish in the air the drum cheerful to sound forward the silver trumpet record echo of victory the barb steed grow proud of this attempt and will ^^and upon no ground but leap and dance with as much courage as do Bucephalus the horse of macedonian Alexander always before any notable victory yea every thing give a evident sign of good success as well senseless thing as live creature with this resolution march the cstristian purpose the utter confusion of the egyptian and the woeful ruin and destruction of Ptolemy sumptuous palace but when the soldier approach the gate with wrathful weapon ready to assault there come pace out thereat the egyptian king with all the chief of his noble attire in black and mournful ornament bear in their hand olive branch next they the brave soldier in Egypt bear in their hand break weapon shiver lance and t^rne ancient likewise follow thousand of woman and child with laurel wreathe about their head and in their hand olive branch cry for mercy to the christian that they will not utter destroy their decline country but show mercy to unhappy Egypt this unexpected sight or rather admirable wonder cause saint George to sound retreat and give commandment through the christian army to withhold their former vow vengeance from the egyptian till he understand what they require which charge be give and o^ely observe saint George with the other six champion come together and admit the egyptian king wi^h their power to their presence who in this manner begin to speak for his country you unconquered knight of Christendom who worthy victory and noble achievment the whole world admire let he that never kneel to any man t^ll now and in former time disdain to humble himself to the great potentate on the earth let he I say the most unfortunate wretch alive crave mercy not for myself but for my country my Common^ blood will be require at my

renown champion of England under who custody my dear daughter be keep e^^n for the love of she be merciful to Egypt the former wrong I proffer thou when I send thou like a guiltless lamb into Persia be contrary to my will for I be incense by the flattery of that accurse blackamon^e king who soul for evermore he scourge with whip of wire and plague with the punishment of Tantalus in hell if my life will serve for a (@) revenge here be my naked breast let my heart blood st^ine some christian-sword that you may bear the bloody wishes of my (@) into Christendom or let i be torn^ into a

forsake our god and believe in that god which you common adore for he be the true and live God we false and hateful in the sight of heaven this penitent lamentation of the egyptian king cause the christian champion to relent but especial saint George who have a heart beautify with the wellspring of pity not only grant mercy to the whole country but vouchsafe Ptolemy liberty of life upon condition that he will perform what he have promise which be to forsake his false god and believe in our true God Christ jesus this kindness of saint George almost ravish Ptolemy with joy and the whole land both peer and commons more rejoice at the friendship of the christian than if they have be make lord of the western world the news of this happy unetie be bruit into all the part of Egypt whereby the commons that before flee for fear into wood and wilderness den and cave hill and mountain return joyful to their own dwelling and cause bonfire to be make in every city town and village the bell of Egypt ring day and night for the space of three month in every place be see banquet dance and mask sorrow be banish war forget and peace proclaim the king at his own charge ordain a

off her garment which be of black sarsenet and in her snow-white smock bind she with a iron chain unto the stake than place they round about her tender body both pitch turpentine and gunpowder with other merciless thing thereby to make her death the more easy and her pain the short which be ^one the king cause the Harrold to summon in the challenger who at the sound of the trumpet come trasing

yet no defendant do appear therefore the king command the executioner to set the stake on fire present at which word Sabra begin to grow as pale as ash and her joint to tremble like to aspen-leave her tongue that before continue silent begin to record a swan-like die tale and in this manner utter she the passion of her heart be witness heaven and all you bright celestial angel be witness sun and moon the true beholder of my ^act be witness thou clear firmament and all the world be witness of my innocence the blood I shed be for the safeguard of my honour and unspotted chastity great God of

hear the sound of a shrill and loud horn the which s. George wind for as then he be near which cause the execution a while to be defer at last they behold a far off a stately banner waver in the air the which the knight carry before saint George then they espy never unto the banner a most valiant arm knight mount upon a coal black Palfrey with a mighty great lance set charge in his rest by which sudden approach they know he to be some champion that will defend the distress lady cause then the king command the drum and trumpet to sound whereat the people give a general sh^w^ and the poor lady half dead with fear begin to revive and her blush cheek to be as beautiful as red rose dip in milk and blood mingle with snow but when saint George approach the sight of his true and constant L^d^ who he find chain to a stake encompass with many instrument of death his heart so relent with grief that he almost fall beside his horse yet remember wherefore he come he recall his courage and intend to try his fortune in the combat before he will discover himself unto his lady and so when the trumpet sound death alarm the two knight set spur to their horse and make they run so fierce that at the first encounter they shiver both their lance to their hand than rush they together so rigorous with their body and helmet that they fall down both to the earth but saint George who be the more lusty knight nimble leap upon his foot without any hurt but the baron of Chester lay still with his h^ad downward cast from his mouth abundance of blood he be so mighty bruise with the fall but when he revive from his trance he take his shield draw out a mighty fawchion and with a wrathful countenance run at saint George now proud knight quoth he I swear by all the saint in heaven to revenge the blood which thou have shed and therewithal he strike so violent upon saint George shield that it cleave quite a sunder then begin he to wax angry and take his sword in great wrath and give the baron of Chester such a stroke that he cut away arm and

among my maid where we pray both day and night that some unhappy fortune or tyrrible vengeance may fall upon this wicked conjurer now as I be true english knight reply s. George no soon shall the morning sun appear but I will take my journey to that enchant tower in to which i will enter in despite of the giant and break the enchantment or make my grave within the monster bowel which if I happy perform then will I travail into Persia and felte up the most wicked and damn nigtomancer and like a blood hound lead he up and down the world in chain most dangerous be the adventure quoth the amazonian queen from whence as yet do never knight return but if thou be so resolute and noble mind as to attempt the enterprise then happy be your fortune and know brave knight that this tower lie westward from hence some threescore mile and thereupon she take he by the hand and cause Sabra likewise to alight from her palfrey and lead they both into her pavilion where they be feast most royal and for that night sleep secure but when the day bright window open and the morning sun begin to glister in all the haste saint George that valiant mind champion arise from his sweet content and arm himself where after he have take his leave of the queen and give her thanks for his courteous entertainment and also take his leave of Sabra who he leave in company of the queen maid till his return with conquest and so ride forth till it be noon and then he enter into a deep ualley and ever he ride low and low it be then a fair day and the sun shine clear but by that time he have ride two mile and a half he have lose both the light of the sun and also the sight of heaven for it be there as dark as night and more dismal than the deep dungeon at last he find a mighty river with stream as black as pitch and the bank be so high that the water can scarce be see run underneath and it be so full of serpent that none can enter among they that ever return back with life Abou^ his head fly monstrous bird and diverse griffon who be able to bear away a arm knight horse and all and be in as great multitude as though they have be starling also there be fly as big as nut and as black as pitch which s^ung he and his horse so grievous that there issue down such store of blood that it change his horse from a sable to a crimson colour likewise the griffon strike at saint George with their talent so furious that have not he defend himself with his shield which cover his whole body he have be pierce to the heart in this dangerous manner ride he on till he come to the gate of the enchant tower where as the giant sit in his iron coat upon a block with a mace of steel in his hand who at the first sight of saint George beat his tooth so mighty together that they ring like the stroke of a anvil and run rage like a fiend of hell think to have take the champion horse and all in his long tooth that be as sharp as steel and to have bear they present into the tower but when saint George perceive his mouth open he take his sword and thrust therein so far that it make the giant to roar so loud that the element seem to thunder and the earth to tremble his mouth smoke like a fiery furnace and his eye roll in his head like brand of flame fire the wound be so great and the blood issue so fast from the giant mouth that his courage begin to quail and against his will he be force to yield to the champion mercy and to beg for life to which saint George agree but upon condition that the giant will discover all the secret of the tower and ever after ^e swear his true servant and to attend on he with all diligence to which the giant swear by his own soul never to leave he in extremity and to answer he true to all question whatsoever then saint George demand the cause of the darkness and how it may be cease to which the giant answer in this manner there be within this country about some twelve year since a cunning necromancer that by enchantment build this tower the which you now behold and therein cause a tyrrible fire to spring from the earth that cast such a smoke over the whole land whereby the people that be wont to dwell therein be flee and famish for hunger also this inch^unter by his art make the river that you have pass the which do never man before this time without death also within the t^wer never unto the fire there stand a fair and plentiful fountain to which if ever any knight be able to attain and cast the water thereof into the fire then shall the darkness ever after cease and the enchantment end for which cause I have be bind to guard and keep this tower from the atchivement of any knight thus when the giant have end his discourse saint George command he to remain at the Gat^ for he will adventure to end the enchantment and deliver the country from so grievous a plague then go he close by the window of the tower the which be sixteen spear in length and breadth till he come to a little wicket through which he must needs enter yet be it set as thick with pick of steel as the prick of a urchen skin to the intent that no knight shall approach near unto the door nor once attempt to enter the tower yet with great danger he open the wicket whereout come such abundance of smoke that the darkness of the country double so that neither torch nor candle will burn in any place yet nevertheless saint George enter and go downwards upon stair where he can see nothing but yet feel so many great blow upon his burgonet that he be constrain to kneel upon his knee and with his shield to defend himself or else he have be bruise to piece at last he come to the bottom and there he find a fair great vault where he feel so tyrrible a heat that he sweat exceed and as he feel about he he perceive that he approach near the fire and go a little further he espy out the fountain whereat he great rejoice and so he take his shield and bear therein as much water as he can and cast it into the fire in conclusion labour so long till the fire be clean quench then begin the sky to receive their perfect lightness and the golden sun to shine most clear about he whereby he plain perceive how there stand upon the stair many great image of brass hold in their hand mighty mace of steel the which have do he much trouble at his come down but then their power be end the fire quench and the enchantment finish thus when saint George through his invincible fortitude have perform this dangerous adventure he grow weary of travail what with heat and sweat and the mighty blow he receive from the brazen image that he return again to the little wicket whereas the deform giant still remain who when he behold the champion return both safe and sound he fall upon his knee before he and say sir knight you be most welcome and happy return for you be the flower of chivalry and the brave champion in the world command my service duty and obedience for whilst I live I do protest by the burn bank of Acheron never to follow any knight but you and thereupon I kiss your golden spur which be the noble badge of knighthood this humble submission of the giant cause the champion to rejoice not for his overthrow but that he have get so mighty a servant then unlace he his helmet and lay down after his weary encounter where after he have sufficient rest himself he take his journey in company of the giant to the amazonian queen where he leave his lady in company of her virgin who like a kind modest and virtuous wife during all the time of her husband absence continual pray to the immortal power of heaven for his fortunate success and happy return otherwise resolve herself if the lower destiny shall cross his intent and unlucky end his day before the adventure be accomplish then to spend the remnant of her life among th^se happy virgin but on the sudden before the queen and her virgin be a ware s. George arrive before the pavilion dutiful attend on by the giant who bear upon his shoulder the body of a tall oak by which the queen know that his prowess have redeem her country from darkness and deliver she from sorrow care and trouble so in company of he^ maid very gorgeous attire she conduct the champion to a bower of rose intermingle with creep vine the which in his absence they have plant for his lady delight there find he Sabra at her divine prayer like a solitary widow clad in mourn habiliment but when she behold her lord return in safety she banish grief and in all haste run unto he and in his bosom ravish herself with pleasure but to speak how the amazonian queen feast they and in what manner she and her maid devise pastime for their content be too tedious to repeat but when night give end to their pleasure and sleep summon all thing to a quiet silence the queen bring they to a very sumptuous lodging wherein stand a bed frame with ebon wood overhung with many pendant of gold the Tik^ be stuff with down of turtle-dove the sheet of maedian silk thereon lay a rich quilt wrought with cotton cover with damask and stitch with thread of gold the queen bestow on saint George at his go to bed a imbrother shirt curious wrought with many rare device as the labour of Hercules the triumph of Mars and the love of many potentate wrought in such curious manner as though art herself have be the contriver Sabra at her go to bed be likewise present by the queen maiden with a light kirtle of changeable ^iolet somewhat blush on a red colour also they put a white kerchief of silk upon her head somewhat lose and untie so that under the same her ivory throat may be easy see and her fair golden hair fly about her neck over they be cast a mantle of green silk which make the bed seem more beautiful than Flora rich ornament by they the queen and her virgin fate make sweet music upon their silver tune lute till golden sleep have close up their eye the which be do the queen with her lady depart likewise to their natural rest but all this while the giant never enter the pavilion but sleep as sound under the root of a Pin^ tree as saint George do in his imbrother bed for he know not what pleasure belong thereunto nor never before that time behold any woman face at last the night withdraw her black curtain and give the morning leave to appear who fearful light cause saint George to forsake his bed and to walk some few mile to overview the country in which journey he take such exceed pleasure that he think it the goodly realm that ever he see for he perceive well how that it be full of worldly wealth at last he climb up to the top of a high mountain be some two mile from the queen pavilion whereon he stand and behold many stately town and tower high and mighty castle many large wood and meadow and many pleasant river and about the town fair vines goodly pasture and field at last he behold the city of Argenia shine against the sun the place where the queen in former time be wont to keep her court which city be environ with deep ditch the wall strong build and more than five hundred tower make of lime and stone also he see many fair church cover with lead have top and fyier of gold shine most gorgeous with weather cock of silver glister against the sun also he see the burgess house stand like palace close with high and strong wall bar with chain of iron from house to house whereat in his heart he praise much the nobleness and richness of the city and say to himself that it may well be call Argenia for it seem to be of that be as much to say of silver during the time of the champion pleasurable walk which continue from the break of day to the close of the evening behapn a woeful tragedy never unto the queen pavilion commit by the monstrous giant who s. George bring from the enchant tower for that same morning when the sun have mount some few degree into the firmament seven of the queen virgin in Sabraes company walk into a pleasant thicket of tree adjoin to her pavilion not only to take the pleasure of the morning air but to hear the chirp melody of bird in which thicket or grove under a pine tree this giant lodge the pass night for no soon come these beautiful lady under the branch of the tree but the giant cast his eye upon they who rare perfection so fire the heart of the lustful giant that he must either quench his desire with the spoil of their chastity or end his day in some monstrous manner therefore he start up from the place where he lay and with a wrathful countenance run amo^gst the lady and catch they all eight at once betwixt his arm he bear they to the further side of the grove where he ravish seven of the queen maiden and afterward devour they alive into his loathsome bowel but Sabra be the eight of that woeful number ^hich in her sight she behold butcher by that bloody wolf still continue the time of their ravishment make h^r supplication to the god that they will in mercy defend her chastity from the lustful ra^e of so wicked a monster and immediate upon these word she see a ugly toad come crawl before she through which by policy she save her life and preserve her honour for she take the toad betwixt her hand and crush the venom from her empoison bowel wherewith she all to be sprinkle her face so that present her say beauty be change into loathsome blister for she then seem more like^ a creature deform with leprosy than a lady of excellent feature at length she be the last of all her time come that she shall be deflower and the lustful giant come to fetch she but when he behold her visage so envenom he loathe her sight seek neither to ravish she nor proffer to devour she but discontentedly wander away great grieve at the commit crime and sore repent himself of so wicked a deed not only for the spoil of the seven virgin but for the wrong proffer to so noble a knight who not only grant he liberty of life but receive he into his service therefore he rage up and down the grove make the earth to tremble at his exclamation one while curse his fortune and hour of creation another while ban his sire and devilish dam but when he remember the noble champion saint George who angry frown he will not see for all the world therefore to prevent the same he run his head most furious against a knobbed oak and brain himself where we will leave he now welter in his blood and speak what become of Sab^^ after this bloody accident for after she have wander up and down the thicket many a weary step incense heaven against the giant cruelty the sun begin to set and the dark night draw on which cause she thus to complain o you immortal power of heaven and you celestial planet be the true guider of the firmament open your bright celestial gate and send some fatal planet or some burn thunderbolt to rid i from the vale of misery for I will never more return to my belove lord sith I be thus deform and make a ugly creature my loathsome face will prove a corasive to his heart and my body a torment to his soul my sight will be displeasant my company hate my presence loathe and every one will shun my sight as from a crocodile therefore I will remain within this grove till the heaven either bring i to my former beauty or end my languish misery yet witness heaven of my loyalty unto my lord and in what extremity I have maintain my chastity in remembrance of my true love here will I leave this chain of gold for my belove lord to find that he may know for his sake I have endure a world of woe at which speech she take her chain which be double twenty time about her neck and leave it lie all be smear in the blood of those virgin who the giant have ravish and slay and so betake herself to a sad and solitary life intend never to come in the sight of man but to spend her day wander in the wood where we will likewise leave she for a time and speak of saint George who by this be return to the queen pavilion where he miss his lady and have intelligence how that she in company of seven other lady walk in the morning into a pleasant grove to hear the melody of bird and since that time no news have be hear of they for as than it grow towards night which cause saint George great to mistrust that some mischance have befall his lady then he demand what be become of the giant but answer be make that he be neither see nor hear off since morning which cause he great to suspect the giant treachery and how that by his mean the lady be prevent of their purpose pleasure therefore in all haste like a frantic man he run into the thicket fill each corner with clamour and resound echo of her name and call for Sabra through every bramble bush but there he can neither hear the voice of Sabra nor the answer of any other lady but the woeful echo of his exclamation which rattle through the leaf of tree then begin he to wax something melancholy and passionate wear the time away with woeful lamentation till bright Cynthia mount on the hemispheere by who glister beam he see the ground besprinkle with purple gore and find the chain that Sabra be wont to wear about her neck all be smeerde in blood he bitter complain against his own fortune and his lady hapless destiny for he suppose then that the giant have murder she o discontent sight say he here lie the blood of my belove lady the true woman that ever knight enjoy that body which for excellence deserve a monument of gold more rich than the tomb of Angelica I fear lie bury in the bowel of that monstrous giant who life unhapps^ie I grant here be the chain besmear with blood which at our first acquaintance I give she in a courtly mask this golden chain I say stain with the blood of my dear lady shall for evermore be keep within my bosom ne^e unto my bleed heart that I may st^ll remember her true love faith and constancy but fond fool that I be why do I talk in vain it will not recompense her murder soul the which i think I hear how it call for revenge in every corner of this groan it be I that leave she careless within the danger of the giant who I little m^strusted therefore will I meet she in the elysian shade and crave remission for my commit trespass for on this oak I will abridge my life as do the worthy knight Melmerophon for the love of his lady which lamentation be no soon end but he take the chain of gold and fasten one end to the arm of a great oak and the other end to his own neck intend present to strangle himself but heaven prevent his desperate intent after a strange manner for under the sam^ tree the brain giant lie not yet full dead who in this manner speak to saint George o stay thy hand most noble and invincible knight the world chief wonder for admire chivalry and let my die soul conver^ thou from so wicked a deed seven virgin in this thicket have I ravish and bury all their body in my accurse bowel but before I can deflower the eight in a strange manner her bright beauty be convert in to a loathsome leprosy whereby I detest her sight and lose her chastity undefiled but by her sad complaint I since have understand how that she be your lady and Lo^^ and to this hour she have her residence with in the c^^uite of this thicket and thereupon with a doleful groan which seem to shake the ground he have a due to the world then saint George be glad to hear such tiding revert from his desperate intent and search up and down the grove till he find Sabra where she sit sorrow under the branch of a mulberry tree betwixt who be a sad and heavy greeting and as they walk back to the queen pavilion she discouse to he the truth of this bloody stratagem where she remain till the amazonian queen have cure her leprosy by the secret virtue of her skill of who after they have take leave and give her thanks for her kind courtesy saint George with his lady take their journey towards Persia where the christian army lay encamp at who arrival you shall hear strange and wonderful thing the like be never do in any age chap 17 how saint

to his native dwell even so it happen to these two lose and disconsolate traveller for when they have wander many day one way and find no end to their toil they retire backward to the place of their first set forth where they be wont to hear the noise of people resound in country village and to meet traveller post from place to place but now they hear nothing but bluster of wind rattle in the wood make the bramble to whistle and the tree to groan and now and then to meet a speckled beast like to the rainbow welter from his den to seek his natural sustenance in their travail by night they be wont to hear the crow cock record glad tiding of the cheerful day approach the nay of horse in pasture field and the bark of dog in farmer house but now they be affright with the roar of lion yell of cave the crook of toad in root of rot tree and the rueful sound of Prognies ravishment recorode by the nightingale in this solitary manner weary they the roll time away till thrice three time the

which make it seem more beautiful than Flora pavilion or Diana mansion but at the last when she feel the pain of her womb grow intolerable and the seed ready to be reap and how she be in a wilderness devoid of woman company that shall be ready to assist she in so secret a matter she cast herself down upon her mossy bed and with a blush countenance she discover her mind in this order to saint

therefore depart my cabinet and before bright Phoebus lodge in the w^st I shall either be a happy mother or a lifeless body thou a joyful father or a sorrowful widower at which word saint George seal agreement with a kiss and silent depart without any reply but with a thousand sigh he have she adieu and so take his way to the top of a mountain be in distance from his lady abide a quarter of a mile there kneel he during the time of her travail with his bare knee upon the bowel of the earth never cease prayer but continual solicit the molestie of God to grant his lady a speedy delivery at who divine orison the heaven seem to relent and all the time of her pain co^ered the world with a vale of darkness whole flight of bird with troop of untamed beast ^ame flock round about the mountain
