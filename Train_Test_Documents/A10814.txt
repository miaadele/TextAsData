against six galley of the turk be of tune in Barbary and have in they of soldier sailor and slave 1800. man love countryman that we shall give honour to they that do true deserve it be no more than christian charity do ensite we unto and the holy scripture in many example do prove unto we as David that kingly prophet and man of God be meet and entertain of the people with dance and sing his worthy victory obtain against the enemy of GOD and his King jephat that worthy captain and sundry other which I omit be honour for their victory with triumph by the people as holy writ do testify the roman so honour their nation and hold honour in such hey esteem that be his birth never so mean or reputation so base yet if he deserve any honour in their war they due give it he with all the honour they can devise the greatians and sundry other nation have the like so that thereby they give such encouragement to all such as follow they in their long war that every man enforce both courage and strength in hope of fame whole volume be fill with the honour of these as we which now live by true record can testify the sundry famous victory by they achieve and their excellent admire prowess these be the time of true love and honour this make the coward hardy and the fainthearted swain to advance themselves in hope to gain unto their posterity everlasting fame oh that our nation will imitate these true tip of honour to nourish such as adventure their life and estate for welfare of their country then there be no doubt but in time of trouble when valour shall be show we shall find many worthy person under simple habit that will purchase to their country honour and fame to themselves but our country charity be too too cold to give virtue her due in such people the more it be to be pity that such man as merit either by valour or other industorous mean shall not be fostered and well reward but such be the hardness of heart in most now a day that let a man adventure their life and liberty in never so hardy a action for saveguard do of ship and good when they look for cheerful countenance at their return and some reward for their pain they hardly get either good word or good deed nay scarce their wage which God know be never so hardly get but with some brawl and discontent these do be often the cause of much loss to owner and merchant where if they nourish the true labour by e^ling with some small reward yea but sometime with a good word it will give encouragement to man rather to lose their life than part with that be commit to their charge in my sleight manner judge you that read and know what you read how many ship and man of our nation have be take by these pirate those homecide that lurk about the south cape Barbary and the straits to surprise such as trade in honest merchant affair the owner and merchant to their cost can best tell of which no doubt some have be cowardly surprise and other overflow whereby the company fall into their hand be imprison and often time make slave to those heathen nation that triumph over they to the utter ruin of they and their for ever these be thing to be pity and true of all christian to be lament and I can wish that such man that adventure to the sea may with true compassion consider of such as do deserve well so shall they be sure to have their service true perform and their good in better security than often time they have but leave that to God who guide man heart let i recoune unto you a most worthy and valiant exploit perform not long since by two small ship of the city of London against six galley of
