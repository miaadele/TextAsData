Metallica.

CAPVT. 1. The Transcript of his Maiesties Indenture.
Reader.
AS I vnderstand, you haue promised and couenanted in your Pattent more fully and euidently to expresse and enlarge in a Printed treatise, to be called Metallica, euery point and part of your priuiledged businesse, to the intent that the Reader might the better conceiue and iudge of the Inuentions propounded, and might the sooner also bee induced to assist, and set forward, so good and worthy workes: First therefore I demand of you by what name and appellation you entitle that generall head, vnder the which you reduce and comprehend all the seuerall Arts and Inuentions of your Pattent.
Author. The generall, that comprehendeth all the other perticular Inuentions, is called Metallica, which is a word deriued and deduced from the Greeke and
Latin words Metallon, and Metallum, which signifie, in English, Mettles, which properly are Minerall substances, digged and taken out of the earth, of which sort, are Iron, Lead, Tin, Copper, Brasse, Gold, and Siluer, etc.
R. 2. Doth your Pattent of Metallica, onely containe the making of mettles by the meanes of Sea-coale and Pit-coale, and with your other Metallicall instruments which you haue deuised for that purpose.
A. His Maiesties gratious grant is very large and ample, for it doth not onely comprehend and priuiledge the making of all kinde of mettles, after the manner prescribed, but also equally authorizeth and licenseth any other Mechanick inuentions comprehended vnder the generall definition of Metallica which is mentioned in the Schedules or Manuscript treatise annexed to the Pattent, which Schedules haue the same force and validitie as his Maiesties Indenture it selfe.
R. 3. Then that I may certainely know and vnderstand the extent of your priuiledge, repeate, I pray you, word by word, the definition of Metallica, as it is written in the said Schedules, annexed to your Pattent.
A. Metallica mentioned in the petition, is thus defined. Metallica is an Art or Inuention, shewing how diuerse things and Materials, now made and atteined vnto, in a very chargeable sort, after the ordinary way, may be made and atteined to after a more cheaper manner, and as with the helpe of common instruments: so more especially by diuerse new deuised
Metallicall instruments and meanes.
From these Metallicall instruments, the Art is generally called Metallica.
R. 4. This summary definition giueth mee some generall light and vnderstanding into your businesses, but that I may bee the more fully satisfied, I pray you rehearse also the tenour of his Maiesties grant, as it is vnder the broad seale of England.

THIS Indenture made, the xxix. day of February, in the yeares of the Reigne of our Soueraigne Lord Iames, by the grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, defender of the faith, etc. of England, France and Ireland the ninth, and of Scotland the xlv. Betwene our said Soueraigne Lord, of the one party, and Simon Sturteuant Gentleman of the other party. WHEREAS the said Simon Sturteuant, by long his study and great charge, hath atteined vnto diuerse new exact Mechanick Arts, Mysteries, Waies and Secrets of his own Inuention, whereby all kind of mettles, works, and other things and materialls, as namely Irons, Steeles, Leads, Tins, Coppers, Brasses, and such like. Secondly all kind of Metalique concoctions, as Sand-mettles, Ash-mettles, Ammels, and such like. Thirdly, all kinde of Burnt-earths, as Tiles, Pauing-stones, Bricks, and such like. Fourthly all kind of Pres-wares, as Prest-tiles, Prest-bricks, Prest-monions,
Prest-stones and such like, with diuerse other things and materials now made after the ordinarie course, with Wood-fewell and Char-coale, may be aswell made, wrought, and effected, as the said Simon Sturteuant affirmeth, with Sea-coale, Pit-coale, Earth-coale, and Brush-fewell, whereby the Woods now generally wasted, in all the chiefe wood-land countries of this realme of England by Iron milnes, and such other Metallicall Furnaces and hearths, may be preserued from the great consumption thereof, and saued from like inconuenience in other his Maiesties dominions, all which premisses, so by this new Inuention to be made, the said Simon Sturteuant hath vndertaken, shall be in substance and for vse as sufficient and as good as the other like Materialls now made and wrought with the chargeable and excessiue waste of Wood and Char-cole. AND whereas also the said Simon Sturteuant, for the better making, working, effecting, beating, burning, melting and effecting, the said mettals, workes, things, and Materialls, by and wth Sea-coale, Pit-coale, Earth-coale, and
Brush-fewell, hath by his said Inuention and skill, inuented diuers Furnaces, hearths, tests, tooles, engins, milnes, and other instruments and meanes, new, and of his owne Inuention, neuer heretofore vsed or put in practise by any other. And hath also by his said Inuentions and skill, attained to the knowledge how to vse and imploy diuerse other common instruments, to the making, working, and effecting the said mettles, workes, materialls, and things, which other common instruments haue bin heretofore, and are vsed in other arts, sciences, and manuell occupations, but were not, nor haue bin as yet conuerted, vsed, or imployed, to, for, or about the making, working, effecting, and producing the said mettels, works, materials and things: which said skil and Inuentio^s of the said S. Sturteuant, and the said mettles, workes, things, and other Materials, and the meanes and instruments whereby to worke and effect the same, are in some measure mentioned and expressed in the Schedule or Schedules, to these presents annexed, and shall bee more fully, amply, and perticularly demonstrated,
specified, described, and conteined in a large treatise, which the said Simon Sturteuant hath already conceiued, and shall bee put in Print, and so published before the last day of Easter terme next ensuing the date hereof, which Treatise so to bee Printed, shall be intituled, A Treatise of Metallica: which said Inuentions of the said Simon, may and will prooue beneficiall to the common-wealth, both in regard of the abundant plenty of the said things and materials which it daily will bring forth, as also because it saueth and preserueth abundance of Timber, Char-coale, Wood-fewell, and other things and commodities wastefully consumed and spent, the generall want whereof already is felt. AND, for asmuch as our said Soueraigne Lord is giuen to vnderstand, that this art, skill, industrie and inuentions of the said Simon Sturteuant, of making, casting, founding, working, and acquiring of the aforesaid mettles, workes of Iron, materials, and things by Sea-coale, Pit-coale, Earth-coale and Brush-fewell, and all and euery, or any of
them, and also the making of the said new deuised engins, hearths, furnaces, and other meanes and instruments, and the imploying of the said instruments, vsed in other sciences and Arts, to the making, working, effecting, and producing the said Mettales and other workes, materials and things, is a thing not yet practised nor brought into any trade, occupation or mysterie, within any of his kingdomes, but is an Inuention in substance new, and which shall not preiudice or crosse any from priuiledge or grant by his Maiestie heretofore made or granted vnder the great seale of England, for the vsing and making of any former Inuention, and therefore fit to bee priuiledged for a certain time, the rather for that his Highnesse conceiueth, that the said inuentions and skils, may and will become profitable and good for the common-wealth of these realms, and also augment his customes and impost, in regard it bringeth forth great and aboundant store of the aforesaid Materials and things, not onely for the vse of his Highnesse realmes
and dominions heere at home, but also for trafficke and Marchandize into forraine Contries abroad, which are customeable. In regard whereof and also for, and in consideration of the good, faithful and acceptable seruices heertofore done and performed vnto his said Maiesty, by the said Simon Sturteuant, As also to the end that the said Simon Sturteuant may receiue some conuenient recompence, benefit and profit for his said seruices, as also for his studies, laboures and charges in perfecting these Inuentions, to the Common good, which may ensue heereby to his Highnes Realmes and Dominions. THIS INDENTVRE WITNESSETH that our said soueraigne Lord the King, of his especiall grace, certaine knowledge and meere motion, and of his prerogatiue royal, hath giuen and granted, and by these presents for him, his heires and successors doth giue and grant, vnto the said Simon Sturteuant, his executors, administrators and assignes, and his, and their Deputy and Deputies the sole, full, absolute and free power, liberty
and authority, to make, worke, produce, accquire and bring forth, all kinde of the aforesaid mettles, and other the materials, and things, by, and with Sea-coale, Pitt-coale, Earth-coale, Brush-fewell, and all, euery, or any of them, in all parts and places of his Maiesties realmes of England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, and also within all the same places and dominions, to make, frame, erect, acquire, and prouide, or cause to bee made, framed, erected, acquired, and prouided, all necessary Instruments and meanes. As namely, all Worke-houses, Furnaces, Hearths, Milnes, Structures, Engins, Vesels, Tests, Tooles, Instruments, Deuises, or things of Iron, or other stuffe or substance whatsoeuer, which are already in vse, in any other trade, mysterie, arte, or occupation, and as yet not exercised or vsed, in, or about the making, working, casting, founding, acquiring, and producing of the sayd mettles and other materialls and things, for, and to the end and purpose aforesaid, viz.

person or persons as the said most excellent Prince shall appoint to receiue the same, at his highnesse Pallace of Saint Iames in the County of Middlesex. And also yeelding, rendring, and paying vnto the most high and mightie Prince Charles Duke of Yorke; second Sonne of our said Soueraigne Lord, vnto his executors and administrators during the said terme of thirty one yeares in the same tearmes of Saint Michaell the Arch-angell, two parts of the said summe and summes of mony and other cleare profits afore said in 31 parts to be deuided to be alwaies paid and deliuered, at the said Pallace of Saint Iames, to such person or persons as our said Soueraine Lord the King, during the Mynority of the said Duke of Yorke, and after his full age hee the said Duke shall appoint to receiue the same: And moreouer yeelding, rendring, and paying vnto Robert Vicount Rochester Baron of Wainick his executors and administrators in the same termes of Saint Michaell and at the said, Pallace of S.

Our said Soueraigne Lord therfore, fauouring the good endeuours and studies of the said Simon Sturteuant in the premisses, and his former seruice done vnto his Highnesse, for him, his heires and successors, for the better encouraging of
him the said Simon Sturteuant, his executors, administrators and assignes, in the same, and the better to enable him to vnder-goe and beare the burthen and charge thereof, and to auoide all deceipt that any way may hinder our said Soueraigne Lord, or the said most excellent Prince, or Duke of Yorke, or any of the said parties aforesaid, doth by these presents declate and signifie, that his Maiesties Royall will and pleasure is, and our said Soueraigne Lord doth hereby streightly will, and command, all, and euery person or persons, of what state, degree, or condition soeuer, that they, nor any of them, during the said terme of one and thirty yeares, shall not presume or attempt, by any arte, deuise, skill, or cunning, directly or indirectly, without the speciall licence, allowance, and consent of him the said Simon Sturteuant, his executors, administrators, or assignes, or of his, or their deputie, or deputies, there-vnto by him, or them lawfully authorised, to make, frame, erect, contriue, or performe any kinde, or kindes of the aforesaid

And if it shall happen that any person or persons, contemptuously neglecting this his Maiesties will and pleasure, in these presents declared, after notice therof giuen, shall make or acquire any kind or kinds of the afore-said mettles, and other the materials and things, by, or with Sea-cole, Pit-coale, Eearth-coale and Brushfuell, or all, some, or any of them, by any of the said meanes and Inuentions, or any part or parcell of them or any of them, or shall frame, worke, erect, vse or imploy any such or the like engins, instruments, tooles, implements or workes, for, and to the purpose and purposes aforesaid, the same, and all, and euery of them shall bee taken and seized, by the Constable or other officer, dwelling neerest thereunto, to, and for the only vse and behoofe of our said soueraigne Lord the King, his heires and successors, AND further our said soueraigne
Lord the King of his more abundant grace, certaine knowledge and meere motion doth by these presents for him, his heires and successors, giue and grant full power and authority to the said Simon Sturteuant, his executors, administrators, and assignes, and his and their Deputy and Deputies and euery of them with the assistance of a Constable, Tithingman, Headborough, or any other ordinary officer in any Citty, towne, place, or places, as well within the liberties as without, within the said Realmes and Dominions, at all and euery time and times, to haue accesse and entry into any house, place, and places, where such mettles and other the premisses shall be made and wrought or otherwise layd vp contrary to his Maiesties grant, and there to search, prouide, and see, that during the said terme of 31. yeares, no manner of such or the like Inuentions, workes, or practizes, of making, or erecting, any kind, or kinds, of the said mettles and other the premisses to be made, wrought, sould, vsed, or imployed, within the said

The Manuscript Treatise of Metallica. CAPVT. 2.
Reader.
5. IN the Transcript of his Maiesties Indenture, which you haue rehearsed, there is further referrence vnto a manuscript Treatise, or certaine schedules which are annexed vnto the grant, which I pray you also rehearse vnto mee, according to the Tenour of the words in the originall.
A. The manuscript Treatise of Metallica, which otherwise is termed by the names of schedules in the Indenture, is comprehended in these ten Sections following.

SECT. 1. Metallica, the generall of all Metallicall Arts.
MEtallica, mentioned in the petition, is thus defined.
Metallica is an Art or Inuention, shewing how diuers things and materials, now made and atteined vnto in a very chargeable sort, after the ordinary way, may be made and attained vnto after a more cheaper manner, and as with the help of common instruments, so more
especially by diuers new deuised Metallicall Instruments and meanes, as in the printed treatise of Metallica, more at large shall bee mentioned and expressed.
From these Metallicall Instruments the Art is generally called Metallica.
The doctrine of Metallica cannot distinctly be known or methodically expressed, except that the Art which prescribeth precepts, general to all Arts and inuentions called Heuretica be first precognized.
R. Define Heuretica.
Heuretica is the Art of inuentions, teaching how to find out new, and to iudge of the old, and so forth, as followeth in the printed treatise of Metallica.
Metallica, thus generally described is of two sorts, Ignemetallica, which worketh with fire and hearth, or Inignemetallica, which vseth not the meanes of fire, for to attaine to the thing or materiall intended, yet it vseth the other Metallicall Instruments, wherevppon it is called more propperly Metallorganica.
Ignemetallica, comprehendeth many generall inuentions, which are reduced into these 7. heads, first Metallica, propriae dicta, secondly Pressoria, thirdly Terrica, fourthly Hydrelica, fiftly Hydrometallica, sixtly Hydropressoria, seauenthly Hydroterrica.


SECT. 2. Metallica proprie dicta.
MEtallica, in the propper and strict signification is thus defined.

Metallica is an Ignick inuention, for the cheaper making of all kindes of mettles or Metalique concoctures, by the meanes of cheape firing, and other Metallical, instruments, wherevpon the materials and things made by this Arte, are called Metaliques.
The contents of Metallica, proprie dicta, in the seuerall Materials which the Art maketh.
The Metalique Materials are as
1. All kind of Mettles as
1. Prepared or roasted oares, Mine-stones, or Mettle-stones beeing the fitt matter of Metallique liquours.2. Irons, Steeles.3. Leads.4. Tins.5. Coppers, brasses.6. Any other new kind of mettles, which may hereafter bee found beeing made and wrought after the said Simon Sturteuant his manner and Inuention.7. All compounded mettles of the same kind, as Pewters, Belmettles, Sodars, Candle-stickmettle, beeing made and wrought after the said Simon Sturteuant his manner and Inuention.All kind of Metalique concoctures and their co^creats, as
1. All kinde of Sand-mettles, or Ash-mettles.2. All kind of Ammels, Beugles, or such commixtures.3. All kind of Metallique slagges or cinders, if (perhaps) they may be turned to some profitable vse.4. Other compounds of the forenamed concoctures, beeing made and wrought after the said Simon Sturteuant his manner and Inuention.
And so forth, as it shall be further mentioned and enlarged in the Printed treatise of Metallica.


SECT. 3. Metallicall Instruments.
THe Instruments and meanes Metallicall, which are vsed for the producing of metallique materialls or things, are of two sorts, common or peculiar.
The common instruments are such which are borrowed from other trades, occupations and mysteries, amongst which wee haue especially vse of Ioyners, Smiths, Turners, not onely of their Instruments and Tooles, but also of their Emporeuticks which they ordinarily make, as Presses, Vices, Screwes, Bellowes, Tongs, etc. made either of Iron and Wood, or of both together.

 The peculiar instruments are those that are of the Authors Inuention, beeing of chiefe and principall vse, for the working of Metallicall effects.
The peculiar Instruments of inuention, are principally of three sorts, Lenick, Plegnick and Caminick.
Lenicks are peculiar Metallicall instruments, which worke their opperation and effect by pressing, impressioning, or moulding, and that either by thrusting or drawing.
All the kindes of these Lenick instruments, are at large described in the doctrine of the arte Pressoria, which is part of the Printed treatise of Metallica.
There is great vse of these Lenick instruments, for the tempering and commixing of Sea-coale and Stone-coale.
Plegnicks are peculiar Metallicall instruments, which performe their opperation and effect, by their dexterous and artificiall ioynt-moouing.
All the kinds of Plegnick instruments, are at large described in the doctrine of the arte Plegnica, which is part of the Printed treatise of Metallica.
There is great vse of the Plegnick instruments for the making of Eumechanick and reformed Milnes and Bellowses.
Caminicks are peculiar Metallicall instruments, which performe their opperation and effect, by the new kind of Furnacing and Hearthing.
All the kinds of Caminick instruments, are at large described in the doctrine of the art Caminica, which is part of the Printed treatise of Metallica.

 The instruments Metallicall, although they are of cheefe vse in all the Metallicall arts, yet are they more peculiarly belonging to Metallica, proprie dicta, and for this cause they are anexed to it.
And so forth, as it shall be further mentioned, and inlarged in the printed treatise of Metallica.


SECT. 4. Pressoria.
PRessoria is a kind of Ignick Inuention, which by the meanes of cheape fiering, and by other Metallicall Instruments and meanes, maketh all kinds of Press-wares or Mould-wares.
Press-ware or Mould-ware is any thing that can bee made, wrought, or formed of clay and earth, not by hand, and the round table (as the Potters vse) but by Presse and Mould, or by pressing and moulding, and that by the help of Metallicall Instruments and meanes.
There be many sorts and kindes of Press-wares by reason of different figures and diuers vses vnto which they are to be applied, all which kindes are reduced to these two heades of Rude-ware and Polisht ware.
Rude-ware are such sorts of Press-ware, which after they are pressed and moulded, require no further ornament; as Prest-pipes, Prest-tiles, Prest-brickes, Prest-stones: and such like, expressed in the printed treatise of Metallica.

 Pollisht-ware, are such sorts of Press-wares, which after they are pressed and moulded, doe receiue further ornament or beauty, as prest-monions for windowes, and prest-columnes, and such like, described in the Printed treatise of Metallica.
And so sorth, as it shall bee further mentioned and enlarged in the printed treatise of Metallica.


SECT. 5. Terrica.
TErrica is an Ignick inuention, for the cheaper making of all kinds of Burnt-earths, by meanes of Metallicall instruments, wherevpon the Materialls made by this Art, are called Terricks.

The contents of Terrica, in the seuer all Materialls which the Art maketh.

The Terrick Materials, are all kinde of burnt-earth, as
1. All bricks burnt or baked, after the said Simon Sturteuant his manner and inuention, though made and moulded according to common order of Brick-makers.2. All kinde of Tiles burnt or baked, after the said S. Surteuant his manner and inuention, though made, and moulded according to common order of Tile-making.3. All kind of Potter-ware, burnt or baked after the said S. Sturteu. his maner and Inuention, though molded according to common order.4. All kinde of limes, plaisters, allablasters burnt, after the said Simon Sturteuant his manner and Inuention.5. All kinde of Way-stones, Way-grauels, Way-earths, burnt and made after the said Simon Sturteuant his manner and Inuention, This arte is called Itineraria.6. Lastly, any other kinde of burnt-earths, that here-after may be deuised, as good and profitable for the common-wealth, being made, burnt, and wrought, after the said Simon Sturteuant his manner and Inuention.
And so forth, as it shall bee further mentioned and enlarged in the Printed treatise of Metallica.


SECT. 6. Hydrelica.
HYdrelica, is an Ignick inuention, for the cheaper making of all kindes of hotte liquids, or liquoures, by the meanes of Metallicall instruments, wherevpon the materials made by this arte are called Hydrelicks.

The contents of Hydrelica in the seuerall Materials which the Arte maketh.
1. The Hydrelick materials are, as
All kinde of Hydrelick waters and their concreats, of which there are diuerse sorts, as
1. All bathing waters, for washing of the body.2. All kind of washing, scouring waters, for washing of foule vessels, foule linen and other cloth.3. All kinde of hot-borne, or liquor, for making of beare or ale, or any other kind of Beauoridge.4. All kinde of hot or warme waters for dying of cloth, silke, or leathers, etc.5. All kind of hot-waters for Felt-making.6. Lastly, all hot-waters for other trades, occupations or mysteries, as the Treatise further expresseth.2. Al kind of Hydrelick vnctions, liquids, or liquours, which flame or burne, and their concreats, as
1. Oyles, Tallowes, Fatts, Marrowes, and such like.2. Waxes, Rossens, Pitches, Tarres, Turpentines, brimstones, and such like vnctions, gummes.3. Al kind of Hydrelick liquors which are mixed and compounded of waterish and vnctious liquids and their concreats, as.
1. All kind of Sopes, whether they bee blacksopes, sweet-sopes, or white-sopes.2. Any other compound Hydrelick, which hereafter may bee deuised or found out, by the said S. Sturteuant his inuentio^.
And so sorth, as it shall bee further mentioned and enlarged in the printed treatise of Metallica.


SECT. 7. Hydrometallica.
HYdrometallica is an Ignick inuention, which with the same furnace, maketh at the same time, Metalique Materials, and Hydrelick Materials, both together, by meanes of Metallicall instruments, wherevpon the Materials, made and brought forth by this Art, are procreated as pares, twins and couples, and are called from hence Hydrometalicks.
The contents of Hydrometallica, beeing an Inuention compounded of two kinds, is diuerse and manifold, according to the seuerall coupling and ioyning of the opposite simples together.

 As for example
2. Mettle-stones prepared and hot-waters.1. Irons and hot-waters.3. Leads and hot-waters.4. Tins and hot-waters.5. Glasse-mettle and hot-waters, and so other couples of opposite Metaliques and Hydrelicks.
And so forth, as it shall be further mentioned, and enlarged in the Printed treatise of Metallica.


SECT. 8. Hydropressoria.
HYdropressoria, is an Ignick inuention, which with the same fire, and the same furnace, maketh at the same time Pres-wares and Hydrelick Materials both together, by the meanes of the Metallicall instruments, wherevpon the Materials made and brought forth by this Art, are procreated, as pares, twins, or couples, and are called from hence Hydro presswares.
The contents of Hydropressoria, beeing an Inuention compounded of two kinds, is diuers and manifold, according to the seuerall coupling and ioyning of the opposite simples together.
As for example.

1. Prest-pipes and hot-waters.
2. Prest-tiles and hot-waters.
3. Prest-bricks and hot-waters.
4. Prest-monions and hot-waters.
5. And such like combination and couples.

And so forth, as it shall be further mentioned and enlarged in the Printed treatise of Metallica.



SECT. 9. Hydroterrica.
HYdroterrica is an Ignicke inuention, which with the same fire, and the same furnace, maketh at the same time, Terricke materials, and Hydrelicke materials both together, by meanes of metallicall instruments, whereupon the materials made, and brought forth by this art, are procreated as pares, twins, or couples, and are called from hence Hydroterrickes.
The contents of Hydroterrica, being an Inuention compounded of two kinds, is diuers and manifold, according to the seueral coupling, and ioyning of the opposite simples together, as.
Burnt-earth, and hot-water.

As for Example.


1. Bricks, and hot-water.
2. Tiles, and hot-water.
3. Potter-ware, and hot-water.
4. And such like combination, and couples.



And so forth, as it shall be further mentioned and enlarged in the Printed treatise of Metallica.
Note also that the compound arts, being rightly and discreetely performed, are farre more profitable,
then the practise of the single arts alone, and the reason is, because that by such a compound furnace, two different workes are done at once, and in a manner with the same charge.
And these are the seuen seuerall heads, and kindes of inuentions: The generall whereof is called Ignimetallica.
There are also diuers other new Arts, and inuentions, which worke not with fire, al which arise (in respect of the meanes and instruments) from the former, And therefore, the generall of them all, is called Ignimetallica, or Metall-organica, as was specified before.


SECT. 10. Metall-organica.
MEtall-organica is an inuention Ignicke, for the cheaper making, and acquiring of diuerse profitable things, workes, and materials, by the meanes of the Metallicall instruments, fire onely excepted, whereupon, the things made and acquired by this art, are called Metall-organickes.
Metall-organica, comprehendeth many worthie inuentions, whereof these seuen are principall, euery one of them making royalties a peece, excepting the wood pleite art.
First, then there is a new art and inuention, Metallorganicke, with cheifely, by meanes of Plegnicke instruments, maketh a new kinde of water-milnes, wind-milnes,
and winde water milnes, and a new kinde of horse-milnes, and hand-milnes, for the grinding of corne, tanners barke, brazill, for the sawing of woods, making of oiles, battering of Irons and coppers, and for tuckeage, and fulleage of wollen cloath, or yeallow oyled leathers, or for any other vse or purpose whatsoeuer, which other milnes are ordinarily turned into. And these Metalorganicke milnes, are lesse chargeable to make, set vp, keepe and repaire, and yet more necessarie and conuenient, then the ordinarie sort of milnes, which be now in vse.
Secondly, there is another new art and inuention, Metallorganicke, which chiefly by meanes of Plegnicke instruments, maketh also an artificiall kind of waterworke, for the aboundant raising and mounting of water, after an easier order, then those that are already in vse in the common wealth.
Thirdly, there is another new art and inuention Metallorganicke, which chiefly by meanes of Plegnicke and Lenick instruments, ioyntly together, maketh singular, effectuall and most excellent deuices. and meanes for the dreyning and drying of marshes, fennes, and low-grounds.
Fourthly, there is another new art and inuention Metallorganicke, which chiefly by meanes of Plegnike and Lenicke instruments, ioyntly together, maketh singular, effectual and most excellent deuises and meanes for the ridding, clearing, and mounting of waters out of Colepits and Minerals, the like was neuer in vse or practize before.

 And here the Ballance engin, made of presswares, is of great and worthie good vse.
Fiftly, there is another new art and inuention Metalorganicke, which chiefely by meanes of Plegnicke, Lenicke, and Caminicke instruments, ioyntely together maketh singular, effectuall and most excellent deuises for the firtelizing, hartening, and improuing of pasture ground, corne ground, and all other barren grounds whatsoeuer.
Sixtly, there is another new art and inuention Metallerganicke, which chiefely by meanes of the Plegnicke instuments, maketh very effectuall and beneficiall instruments of fishing, as new kinde of Burces, new kinde of Nettage, and Bateage, by which new deuised meanes great aboundance of fish may be caught with farre lesse charges, and in shorter time, then by the ordinary arts of fishing.
Seuenthly, there is another new art and inuention, Metallorganicke, which chiefly by meanes of the Plegnicke instruments maketh diuerse kinds of househould moueables, as artificial Dores, Windowes, Curteines, Presses, Tables, Stooles, Beadsteds, Hangings, Chests, and diuers other things, handsomer and more conuenient then heretofore is done by the ordinatie way of other stuffe.
Where note, that the Materials made by this Mechanicke art, are called wood-pleits.
And so forth, as it shall bee further mentioned and enlarged in the Printed treatise of Metallica.




CAP. 3. Heuretica defined and deuided into his reall and Tecknick parts.
R.
6. SIR you hauing thus set downe both the Transcript of his Maiesties Indenture and the Schedules anexed, I pray you proceed more fully to entreat of the doctrine of Metallica, which seemeth to be handled in the next place.
A. It appeareth out of the first Section of the Schedules, annexed to the Patent, that the doctrine of Metallica cannot distinctly be knowne or Methodically expressed, except that the art which prescribeth precepts, general to all arts and Inuentions, called Heuretica, be first precognized.
R. 7. Define therefore breefely Heuretica.
A. Heuretica is the Art of Inuentions, teaching how to find out new, and to iudge of the old.
R. 8. What deuision is there for Heuretica?
A. The doctrine of Inuentions hath two parts Reall and Technick.
R. 9. Define the Reall part.
A. Reall is the first Part of Heuretica, which treateth of the Instruments and Reall things, which belong to the Inuentions.
R. 10. How is the reall part deuided;

 A. The Reall part spreadeth it selfe into two branches, whereof the first is called Organick, and the other Emporeuticall or Polecall.
R. 11. Define the Organick part.
A. The organick is a part of Heuretica, which setteth downe the meanes and Instruments, whereby the work of Art, intended, is brought forth, made and effected,
R. 12. Define the Emporeuticall or Poleck part.
A. The Emporeutick is an Organick part of Heuretica, which treateth of the worke of the art, which are commodities and wares for vse and sale, wherby profit is raised.
Where note that the comodities, wares and things of euery inuention, for generall vse, are called from this part Emporeuticks.
Note also, that Emporeuticks, being things artificiall, are also fitly called materialls, but if they be naturall, they are called things accquired by the art. So fish and foule are the Emporeutick things, acquired by the art of fishing and fouling, but lead and Iron are Emporeutick Materials made and wrought by Metallicque art.
R. 13. Define the Technick part.
A. The Technick is that habituall part of Heuretica, which treateth of the dexterous habit and faculty wherewith all the Artizands are to be quallified and endowed, who are apointed to make the Emporeutick workes of Inuentions,



CAP. 4. Another partition of Heuretica and an Inuention Mechanick defined.
R.
14 WHat other diuision is there for Heuretica?
A Heuretica in respect of the worke intended is diuided into two parts, namely, into the Scientiffick part and Mechanick part.
R. 15. Define the Scientiffick part.
A. The Scientiffick is that part of Heuretica which prescribeth prceepts generall to all liberall arts, the end of which Arts, is cheefely Science or knowledge and not any reall visible worke, or sensible thing.
R. Define the Mechanick part.
A. The Mechanick part is that part of Heuretica which prescribeth precepts generall to all illiberall arts, the end of which arts is cheefly a reall visible work or sensible thing.
And the Inuention in this kind is called an Inuention Mechanick.
R. 16. Define therefore an Inuention Mechanick.
A. A Mechanick Inuention is the art of the Inuentor, which by effectuall Instruments and meanes bringeth forth some new visible or sensible worke good and profitable to the common-wealth.

 So the Inuention of printing is the skill and art of Faustus Guttenbergius, which mistery (by the effectual deuised means of the Presse, the Incke, the Characters and paper) bringeth forth impressions and Bookes, which Mechanick workes are profitable and good for mans vse.
Where note, that, First the Mechanick Art, secondly the Instruments and meanes, thirdly the worke of the art, made by those Instruments, and meanes, are all called Mechanicks, and are all Inuentions in respect of the Author that deuised them.
R. 17. Expresse further euery word and clause of this definition, to the intent that I may the better vnderstand them.
A. Your desire shall bee satisfied. First then to speake of the thing defined, you must note that any other deuice, course or way which bringeth forth no externall or Materiall worke, are also in respect of the Inuentor tearmed Inuentions.
So the first discouery of the west Indies by Columbus, (in respect of him) is fitly called his Inuention, and the turning point of Nauigation called the Cape of bona Speranca is Gaymus his inuention the like may be said of fretum Magellanicum, and fretum Dauies, which although they are laudable Inuentions, discouered by ingenious and venturous persons, yet cannot they be said to be Mecanicks. because they produce or leaue behind them Mechanick work, nor had any Mechanick instruments made by hands of man directly,
and of purpose for the performance of them, for these Mechanicks are onely propper to these kinds of inuentions which wee treate of.
R. 18. Wherefore call you an inuention a Mechanick Arte.
A. To put a distinction betweene these inuentions Mechanicall, and other inuentions of the liberall Arts and Sciences, of which sort are Logick, Rhetorick, Grammer, and the Mathematicall sciences, all which had their first Authours and Inuentors.
R. 19. Wherfore say you the art of Inuentioner.
A. To shew that there is no Inuention without relation to the Inuentioner.
R. 20. Why then it seemeth that all Arts, sciences, mysteries, trades, crafts, things and deuises, which are now extant in the common-wealth, are, and may bee called Inuentions.
A. Yea verily so they may, if wee respect the Inuentioner, and first Authors of them, but if we respect the persons that vse and put in practize the said Inuentions at the second hand, as we say, such as are the Artificers, Tradesmen and others that make the said Mechanick workes, in respect of these secondary persons they are called Arts, Trades, Crafts, Syences, Misteries, Occupations, Professions, and slightes, etc.
So the printing, as also the Presse, the Paper, the Characters, together with the works done, as impressions, bookes, and vollumes, in respect of Faustus are his Inuention, but in respect of Printers, which now
a dayes worke by his inuention, Printing is rightly called an arte, trade, or mistery, the like may bee said of all other Mechanicall trades now extant in the common-wealth, and of all other profitable inuentions, which here-after may be brought to light in the common-wealth.
R. 21. To what vse serueth the knowledge of this.
A. This fitly serueth to refute the erronious folly of such shallow simple persons, which cannot abide any new inuentio^, which this our age bringeth forth, they vtterly distaste both the proiects and Inuentors, they forsooth (as they say) will giue no assistance, they will not meddle nor deale with them, they will not vse their new worke, though neuer so good and profitable, nay they say more, after their fond fashion, it will neuer prooue good, or come to passe, with a hundred such like speeches, tending to the dispraise both of the Inuentioner, and of things deuised by him, but being demanded for their reason, they haue none to alleadge, except onely a womans reason, like vnto that of the Epigrammatist:
Non amo te Volusi, non possum dicere quare,Hoc tantum possum dicere, non amo te.
But if these men, who so much spurne at inuentions, did well consider, that all ancient Mechanick trades, occupations, professions and workes, which now are in vse in the common-wealth, were new at the first, and had their beginning and infancy, and how they
were then the peculiar inuentions of some ingenious wits, who trauelled with all their endeuours to bring forth the said inuentions, to the good of that age wherein they liued. If I say they did well, consider and ponder this, they would not be so auerse and bitter against laudable, and good proiects, brought forth now a dayes, for with as good reason they might enueigh against printing, shipping, milning and buildings, against the ordinary waies of making of salts, alloms, coppresses, and saultpeeter, against the trade and art of making of hats, and knit-stockings, shooes, bootes, and apparell, against the art and trade of making of saddles, carts, ploughes, harrowes, and against the art of melting, founding, and casting of mettles, of forging, hammering, and battering of irons, brasse, peuters, siluer, and gould; and finally against all other trades, occupations, vocations, and professions in the common-wealth, as so basely to regard and esteeme the proffitable and new inuentions of our daies. Againe, in scorning, and contemning of profitable businesse of late inuention, they set themselues not onely against man, but also against the spirit of God, who is the authour of the said gifts, and first worke of them in man, as it is expressely taught in the 31. of Exodus: in the example of two worthy inuentioners, and artificers, the wordes of the text are these. Behold (saith God to Moses) I haue called by name Bezaleele the sonne of Vri, the sonne of Hur, of the tribe of Iuda, whom I haue filled with the spirit of God in wisedome and
in vnderstanding, and in knowledge, and in all workemanship, to finde out curious workes, to worke in gold, in siluer, and in brasse. Also the Art to set stones, and to carue in timber, and to worke in all manner of workemanship. And behold I haue ioyned with him Aholiab, the sonne of Ahisamah of the tribe of Dan, and in the hearts of all that are wise-harted, I haue put wisedome to make all that I haue commanded thee.
Out of which words of holy Scripture it is apparent that all Mechanicke Arts and Inuentions, as well as the graces of saluation, are the peculiar workes, and gifts of Gods holy spirit in man, which bloweth where, and when he listeth, and powreth out his spirit, vpon some men in euery age.


CAP. 5. Transient instrumentall meanes.
R. 22. In the definition of the Organicke part, you say that the worke is produced by instruments and meanes, I would therefore know of you, how many kindes of instruments and meanes there are to effect a new businesse.
A. The Organick things for the effecting of a new Inuention are of two sorts, Permanent or Transient.
R. 23. Describe the Transient Instrument and meanes.

 A Instruments and means are said to be Transient, when in respect of their vse, they serue but once for that imployment for which they were appointed, so fuell and oare are Transient, because they wast and consume in that Materiall which they make.
R. 24. How many kindes are there of this Transient sort
A. Two: Efficientall, or Materiall.
R. 25. Describe the Efficientall Instruments.
A. Efficientall are such Transient Instruments and meanes as vanish and consume away in their first vse, whilst they are performing their operation and efficiency to produce the pretended Mechanick work, as namely the fuell or fiering in euery businesse.
R. 26. Describe the Materiall Instruments.
A. Materiall, are such Transient Instruments and meanes wherof the Instruments consist and are made, not vading or vanishing away, but remaining transformed or altered in the substance of the thing effected, as namely the stuffe and matter of euery Mechanick instrument.


CAPVT. 6. Permanent Instruments and meanes.
R.
27. I vnderstand well the Transient instruments, with their seuerall kindes, pray you describe the permanent.
A. Instruments and meanes are said to be permanent when as they serue to performe their operations
diuerse times (to wit) in this thing, in that thing, and in many others, of this sort are all tooles in euery trade, all kilnes, furnaces, ouens, hearthes, in euery trade. If we respect the first making and creation of permanent instruments, then must we consider their efficientall, and materiall meanes also.
R. 28. How many kindes are their of this sort.
A. Two, for these permanent meanes, are either personall, as namely the workeman and artificers in euery action; or else impersonall, of which sort are all other instruments of the businesse.
R. 29. How many sorts of workemen are there for euery inuention.
A. Two, primary, and annuall, primarie as the inuentioner to guide, and artificers to make, the annuall are the daily workemen which make the Mechanicke.
R. 30. How many artificers are necessarie for the prymarie, and first foundation of mechanicke inuentions.
A. These subsequent are most necessarie, as namely; Ioyners, Carpenters, Smithes, Brickelayers, Masons, whereunto in seuerall inuentions, diuerse other Artificers are to be added, as occasion serueth, as Shoomakers, Glouers, Bellowes-makers etc.
R. 31. How many sorts of annuall workemen are necessarie for the yearely managing of an inuention.
A. Two, the maister and ouerseer, or his apprentices, or seruants, which make the mechanicke worke, And secondly, the repairationers, which maintaine and mend the instruments and meanes which at the
first they made and formed.
R. 32. What distribution haue you for impersonall instruments.
A. The impersonall instruments, are either generall or speciall, the generall is the worke-house wherein other instruments doe their operations, worke and imployment, and vnder this head we comprehend the ground, place, yard, or roome, where the Mechanicke businesse is wrought or done. The speciall impersonall instruments, are all other impersonall instruments, besides the worke-house or place. Amongst which impersonall instruments furnacing may here bee briefely touched as being a necessarie instrument in most inuentions.
R. 33. How define you a furnace.
A. A furnace is the artificiall receptacle, which beareth and conteineth fewell and the fire.
R. 34. How may kindes are comprehended vnder this head of furnacing.
A. Diuerse, as namely all kinde of ouens, lamps, stoues, kilnes, hearths, all which we generally comprehend vnder the name of Furnacing.


CAP. 7. Instruments and meanes procured and meerely opperatiue, monies and charges of a businesse.
R.
35. WHat other distribution haue you of instruments, and meanes of a busines, in respect of charges.

 A. Organicke meanes of a Mechanicke, are either procuring, or meerely opperatiue.
The procuring meanes is monie to be impended and disbursed in charges.
It is the instrument of instruments, and meane of meanes, procuring all other instruments and meanes meerely opperatiue, and when once they are procured and prouided by it, it measureth their worth and valluation, whereupon Aristotle calleth it, communis mensura omnium.
R. 36. What is generally to be knowne and considered, concerning the monies to be disbursed in a busines.
A. Monies or charges of a busines, are either primarie and once impended, or else annuall, and at certaine times to be renewed.
R. 37. What differe^ces are their of primary monies.
A. Primary monies are either disbursements about the first foundation, or about the tryall.
R. 38. What call you fundamentall charges.
A. Charges of foundation are all such primary monies which are to be disbursed at the first erection or setting vp of a new businesse, or of grand Mechanickes, in some one conuenient place, whereby a worke-house is furnished with all permanent necessary tooles and instruments.
R. What call you charges of tryall.
A. Charges of tryall are the primary monies which are bestowed and disbursed about the tryall and experimenting of an inuention or new businesse.

 R. 40. Wherein consisteth the chiefe charges of tryall.
A. The triall monies are to be disbursed first about the Theoricke instruments, and meanes of an inuention, that is the whole description of an inuention. Whether it be by way of manuscript writings, or printed treatises.
Secondly, about the moddles of an inuention, whether they be superficiall, or reall, motionall or directionall.
And lastly about the erection and foundation of the Protoplast, vnto which al the other grand mechanickes are to be conformed.
R. 41. Concerning the charge of tryall, what is fittest for an Inuentioner to demaund of them that are willing to deale in a new businesse.
It is the wisest, safest, and most credible course for the Inuentioner, not to aske vnder-hand, whereby he shall be driuen to repaire to them againe the second time, but rather at the first let him aske and agree for more monie, and not for lesse then will serue the turne.
R. 42. What other chiefe rules ought an Inuentioner carefully to obserue in the practise and tryall of any new inuention.
A. That he may make tryall and put in practise his new deuise and inuention with good successe and to purpose, let him alwaies well remember these subsequent rules.
1. Make things stronger, then that exact strength
which the thing is to haue.
2. Make things greater then that exact greatnesse which the thing is to haue.
3. And therefore make thinges longer, broader, thicker and wider, then that exact length, breadth, thicknesse and widenesse that the thing is to haue.
4 Make more in number then that exact number which is required to serue the turne.
5. Take longer time for a new busines then will serue the turne.
6 For quallities as hardnes, softnes, drinesse, moistnes, stiffnes, toughnes, etc. obserue this Rule.
Let things be tempered to a greater quallity then will serue the turne.
7. Yet if the Inuentioner can make the thing in the exact truth, then let him do it accordingly, for this is alwaies least chargeable.
R. 43. In the first triall of things can the Inuentioner perfectly hit on the exactnesse of euery particular instrument and means belonging to the new busines.
A. The Vndertakers and dealers are to expect some losse in triall of new businesses, be the Inuentioner neuer so perfect in his Theorick; for although he do his best indeauor, and giue perfect directions to his workmen and Artificers, yet they will often faile and erre in their worke, by which meanes the instrument being experimented and put to triall, becometh
insufficient, for the appointed vse, and many times the Inuentioner in some one point may faile himselfe; for which there is no helpe but only to redresse and amend the fault in the instrument, or else to make a new instrument in the others stead, neither of which can be done but with further charge.
R. 44. What call you the Annuall charges of an inuention.
A. Annuall, are such monyes which from time to time, vpon occasion, are bestowed after the first Plantation vppon the repairing, maintaining, and continuing the said primary instruments belonging to the said new businesse.


CAPVT. 8. Inuentions intermixtand pure moddle, Protoplast and grand Mechanick defined.
YOu haue handled the doctrine of the generall meanes and Instruments of Inuentions, proceed I pray you to speake of the differences and diuers kindes of Inuentions, and First therefore I desire to know.

 R. 45. How many sorts or kindes of Inuention are there being compared or considered one with another?
A. Two, An Inuention is either pure or intermixt, an Inuention is said to bee pure and entire within it selfe, when as none of the parts essentiall are common to any other Inuention for the same vse.
Intermixt when as some of the parts are found in some other former inuention.
So a Windmill is an intermixt Inuention, because some of the partes, as namely the Milne stones, the rong-wheeles and the Cogg-wheeles were first extant in awater-milne or horse-milne and quernes.
But a hand-Querne was a pure and simple Inuention because none of the parts there of were formerly extant in any other Mechanick.
And so printing is a pure and simple Inuention, because none of the essentiall parts thereof were taken from any former Inuention, where they were applied to the same vse.
Where note that the common parts of an intermixt Inuention are to be esteemed as propper and peculiar to the same Inuention, when as they are conioyned and mixed in with other new things Instruments and meanes, which are the essentiall parts of the new deuise.
R. 46. What other distribution haue you of an inuention in respect of magnitude.
A. In respect of greatnesse or quantity, there are
three sorts of inuentions, namely the Moddle, the Protoplast, and the grand Mechanick.
R. 47. Describe the Moddle.
A. The Moddle is a Mechanick, which onely representeth and decyphereth, in some little platforme, the true part and lineaments of the Mechanick inuention, beeing insufficient to yeeld any Emporeutick vse of the inuention.
So the Moddle of a winde-milne, representeth the failes and other parts of Fabrick and structure, but grindeth no corne.
Where note, that some times the moddle is to be made greater then the Mechanick, esp ecially in small curious things, as in a watch, and such like.
R. 48. How many sorts of moddles are there.
A. Two, Superficiall and Reall.
The Superficiall describeth onely the parts and line aments in paper, bordes or past-bords, by limning, drawing, or painting, shewing no action or opperation, nor corporall dimensions of the parts.
A Reall moddle is that which sheweth euery part of the greater Mechanick, in a true and liuely (though little) proportion, hauing his parts fitted for motion, action, or opperation: Neuerthelesse it is not so effectuall or fully vse-full, beeing onely representatiue, as was touched before.
So a little ship, which you haue hanging vp in a marchants house, is the Reall moddle of a grand ship or sea vessell, because it representeth euery part and action thereof.

 R. 49. What is the principall vse of a Reall Moddle.
A. The cheefest vse of a reall moddle is that the Inuention may thereby more perfectly and exactly direct both himselfe, and also guide his workmen for the finishing of any grander Mechanick of the same kind, thereby the better to produce and bring forth the Theorick conceiued in his mind into the grand Reall Inuention.
So the vse of a small reall moddle of a Wind-milne serueth uery fitly to direct both the Inuentor himselfe and likewise all his Carpenters and other workmen, to proceed infallibly to build and set vp a reall and grand windmilne intended to be made.
R. 50. How many sorts of reall moddles are there.
A. There are two sorts, for either they are meerely directionall or also motionall.
Directionall is that moddle which is made only to direct and guide the Artificer in the dimensions of all the parts, as also for to direct them for the kinds of the matter and the stuffe that they are to haue to make the engin intended.
R. 51. What is the fittest and cheapest stuffe to make a directionall moddle of.
A. Past-boordes and reedes are the fittest either for Iron-works or woodworks, wherof the Past-bords are in stead of boordes, plancks and bed-sides.
And the Reeds are to represent round Cylindriack timber, as also other square timber, as namely single
quarters, double quarters, puncheons, rafters, transummes etc.
So that of these the Inuentioner may fitly and speedily make and contriue the fabricke and structure of any directionall moddle.
R. 52. What call you a motionall moddle.
A. A motionall is that moddle Reall which is made compleat in euery part, hauing his true vse, opperation and motion, as in the grander Mechanickes, yet hauing no Emporeuticke commodity, but onely for shew and tryall, and not for sale and vse.
There are three degrees in this motionall moddle, the meane moddle, the lesser then the meane, the greater then the meane.
The meane moddle is a motionall, which hath his magnitude and greatnesse betweene the other extreames, being the least chargeable to be made. And it is alwaies greater then the lesser motionall, and lesser then the greater motion all: and there is but one meane modle to be found in the progressio^ of the same degres
Where note that it belongeth principally to the Inuentioners skil and care to set forth the dimensions and parts of his moddle, intended with the least expence of charges that may be, and in the easiest and rediest manner for his workemen to vnderstand and imitate, or else he hitteth not vpon the meane moddle, but vpon some other extreame.
R. 53. Define the Protoplast.
A. The Protoplast is an Inuention mechanick which first is set vp of that kind, and seruing to profitable
Emporeuticke vses, hauing all the principall parts, actions, and perfections, which all other subsequent grand Mechanicks ought to haue of the same kinde, which afterward are to be made and framed by it.
So the first windmilne that the inuentioner euer set vp to grinde corne was the Protoplast and example from whence all other wind-milnes sprange and were deriued, the like may bee said of the first of euery kinde of Mechanicke, as of Faustus his first Printing Presse, etc.
R. 54. Define a grand Mechanicke.
A. The grand Mechanicke, is that which is set vp after the forme and tipe of his Protoplast, for the same vse and purpose, onely differing from the Protoplast in greatnesse, or with some profitable additions which later experience hath taught.
So the Windmilnes in More-fields are Mechanicks of that kinde of inuention, for they are builded after the Archerype of the Protoplast which the inuentor first inuented and erected, seruing to the same vse of grinding of corne; they differ onely in this, they haue a deuise called the Crampe, which will sodenly stay (in the face of the storme) the violent motion or circumgyration of the wheeles, vntill the sales are taken downe or fardled vp.



CAP. 9. Innentions Heterocresious and Homocresious, primatiue, and deriuatiue, defined.
Reader.
55. VVHat other distribution haue you of a Mechanick inuention, considered one with an other.
A. Inuentions considered compasatiuely one with another, haue two differences, for they are eyther Heterocresious, or else Homocresious.
Heterocresious, are inuentions which produce different Mechanick workes, wares and commodities. So milning and shipping are two Heterocresious inuentions, because the worke of the one is meale or flower, and the worke of the other is carriage or transportage.
R. 56. Define Homocresious Inuentions.
A. Homocresious inuentions, are such which produce and bring forth Emporeuticall workes for the same vse.
So a horse-milne, a water milne, a wind-milne are Homocresious, because they all grinde flower, though after different manner and wayes.
R. 57. What distribution haue you for Homocresious.
A. An Inuention Homocresious, is either primatiue or deriuatiue, the primatiue is that which was the
first in vse in the world of the same kinde.
So a Pestle and a Morter is a primatiue inuention, because it was first vsed for to beat and bruse corne into meale and powder, and at this day it is still vsed to grinde eaten grotes, but a hand-querne, a hors-milne, a winde-milne, and a water-milne, are Inuentions deriuatiue, all which were found out in succession of time, long after the pestle and the mortar.
R. 58. Giue some other illustrious examples of primatiue and deriuatiue inuentions.
A. In matters of literature, the Art of writing with the pen, is a worthy primatiue inuention, both for writing and reading, found out by Moses, that learned Leuite and thrice holy Prophet, the deriuatiue inuention, whereof is Printing, a far more exquisite mistery deuised of late yeares by Faustus Guttenbergius.
So in husbandry the Spade, the Rake, and Shouell, was a worthy primatiue inuention of Adam, for the tillage and sowing of the ground, according to that ancient and old prouerbe.

When Adam digged, and Eue span,
Who was then a Gentleman.

But the Plough and the Harrow are their deriuatiue inuentions, which for the vses of husbandry doe farre exceed them, for by them more worke of tillage of the ground may be done in one day with the same charge, then could be done by their primatiue inuentions in twenty dayes.

 Againe the Barrow which carrieth burdens from places is a primatiue inuention, but the Cart with wheeles is a far more excellent deriued Mechanick, because it carrieth more in one day, then the primatiue can doe in ten dayes with the same charges.
And this Inuention of round wheeles to draw and carry loades with a small strength vndoubtedly was grounded on this Geometricall axiom, Circulus tangit planum vnico puncto, for if the wheeles should haue beene made square, trencher wise, or in any other poly-angle, forty horses would not so easily draw them beeing laden, as two doth now with both speed and ease. And thus much for the example of primatiue and deriuatiue Inuentions.
Where note, that the deriuatiue must alwayes bee of a greater vse, and doe more good in the common wealth, then the primatiue, or else it is not to bee receiued.
Note also, if there be many deriuatiues in the same kinde, the latter inuention must alwayes better the former, and beeing all of them compared and rancked with their primatiue, they make an Inuentionall progression, one exceeding an other, in goodnesse and vse, amongst which, the last of all ought to bee the best, and is therefore called the Eumechanick in the progression of that kinde.
R. 59. Giue some examples of Inuentionall progression.
A. I will satisfie your desire, and first in matter of husbandry, for the making of bread, which mainteineth
the life of man, there is a progression of these fiue Inuentions.
First the Mortar, secondly the Hand-querne, thirdly the Horse-milne, fourthly the Water-milne, fiftly the Winde-milne.
To which if we adde the inuention of the Plegnick Milne, it maketh vp the sixt, and is the Eumechanick of that kinde.
Secondly, in hose or stockings, there is a progression of three, cloth or kersey stockings, which were first in vse: Secondly in knit stockings with Needles: Thirdly, and lastly, in knit stockings with loome, which is a late Inuention of one Maister Lee.
Thirdly, in vessels of drinking, there is a large progression. For first, to pretermit the cup of the hand, out of which Adam and Gedeons three hundred Souldiers dranke, Iudg. 7.6. There is secondly the earthen Pitcher, which the Samaritane woman had at the Well: and the third roome came vp the vse of the black Leather Iacks, an ancient drinking vessell of our natiue countrymen, and the fourth place sprung vp the vse of Tankards and Wodden Kans, in the fift out of Hornes, in the sixt Silues, Gould, greene-Glasse, Venice glasse, and Peuter.
All inuentions, for the most part, of latter times, are deriuatiue, and the Inuentioners are to make choice of this kinde, and needeth the lesse to spend his time about any primatiue deuice.



CAP. 10. Inuentions organicall and emporeuticall: The parts and adiuncts: The Theoricke and Practicke of an Inuention Organicall.
R.
60. VVhat other distribution is their of an inuention Mechanicke.
A. An inuention Mechanicke, in respect of vse is either Organicall or Emporeuticall.
An Inuention Organicall is that artificiall fabricke or structure compacted of all impersonall instruments and meanes which make the Emporeuticke comodities.
So the windmilne considered in it selfe is the compact, structure or fabricke, which comprehendeth all permanent instruments and meanes which produce, yeeld, and bring forth meale or flower.
But the flower and meale thus ground and made by the windemilne Engin is fitly called the inuention emporeuticall.
So likewise the whole structure and complement of all the permanent, and impersonall instruments, and meanes which make vp the Ferricall furnace, is termed the inuention.
R. 61. What differences haue you for the parts of an Inuention Organicall.
A. The parts of an inuention Organicall, are either essentiall or inessentiall, comon or peculiar Organicall.

 But the earth-coale iron which is made by the said complement, and panoply of instruments is fitly called the Emporeuticall inuention of the Author or Inuentor.
R. 62. Describe the essentiall parts of an inuention Organicall.
A. The essentiall part of an inuention Organicall is any maine and chiefe member, whereby the engin is well enabled to performe his worke and operation, which being lacking, the other parts of the engin become ineffectuall, and inoperatiue, for the producing the Emporeuticke intended.
So a windmilne consisteth of all hisessential parts, besides his crosse sales is ineffectuall and not able to grinde corne, the like may be said if it lacke a cogwheele, a ronge wheele, a milne-stone, or any other essentiall part.
R. 63. Describe an inessentiall part of an Inuention Organicall.
A. An inessentiall part is an additament, which indeede somewhat bettereth and helpeth the Inuention, when it is added to the maine complement of the Machin, or Engin, yet being lacking and not vsed, it taketh not away the opperation or worke of the inuention or engin: of this sort, is the crampe of a windmilne, which is a very good and worthy addittament, found out by some ingenious Milner of late, and it is able to hold the crosse sales immoueable, euen in the very blast of a storme.

 Yet wind-milnes which haue not nor had not this later addition of the crampe doe daily grinde corne aswell as other wind-milnes which are there withall furnished.
But in a storme they are driuen to this inconuenience: that three or foure must presently goe downe to turne their crosse failes out of the winde, that they may take downe and fardle vp their sailes.
So likewise the brasse plate and the rouling girth are necessarie and conuenient additions in the engin of the Printing Presse, and both of them were of late yeares first deuised (as it is said) by one Maister Haruie an ingenious Printer in London.
Yet before they were added or vsed in the mistery of Printing, Faustus his inuention was absolute and compleate of it selfe.
R. 64 Describe the common parts of an inuention Organicall.
The common parts are such as are borrowed from other trades, occupations and misteries formerly inuented and in vse, and now adioyned and mixed in, amongst the new parts of the Inuention.
R. 65. What call you the peculiar parts of an inuention.
A. The peculiar parts are such as are proper and of the essence of the inuention, not being taken from any other Mechanicke, formerly in vse.
So the sayles, the milne-post, the spurs of a wind-milne are his peculiar parts, but the cogge-wheeles,
ronge-wheeles, and milnestones are common parts as being assumed and borrowed from the horse-milne and water-milne formerly in vse.
R. 66. What differences haue you for the adiuncts of an inuention Organicall.
A. The adiuncts of an inuention Organicall haue the same differences, which the parts of an inuention had before.
For the adiuncts are either essentiall or inessentiall, common or peculiar, the nature and distinction of which differences may be easily conceiued and vnderstood by the descriptions of the former seuerall parts.
R. 67. What other differences haue you for the adiuncts of an inuention Organicall.
A. The adiuncts of an inuention Organicall are also necessarie or lesse necessarie.
Necessarie adiuncts are all such which of necessitie are to be vsed for the producing of the intended Mechanicke.
And the lesse necessarie are all such which bringes some small helpe to make and bringe forth the Emporeuticke.
R. 68. What distribution haue you of an inuention Organicall.
A. An inuention is said to haue a Theoricke or a Practicke.
R. 69. What call you Theoricke Inuention.
A. The Theoricke of an inuention is the declaration of the contents thereof by a plaine and familiar discription, and that either by manuscript
writings or by printed treatises.
R. 70. What Arguments are cheefe for the description of an Inuention.
A. The arguments of the parts and adiuncts, or the Arguments of Instruments and meanes.
R. 71. Do the parts, and adiuncts, and Instruments, and meanes, expresse diuers meanes.
A. No, for by parts and adiuncts are vnderstood the selfe same things, which are meant by instruments and meanes, but yet in diuers and different respects: for they are called parts and adiuncts in respect that the Mechanick Engin subsisteth and consisteth of them, but in respect of the Emporeutick, which is made by them, the said partes and adiuncts are fitly called Instruments and meanes.
So a printing Presse hath his seuerall parts, whervpon it doth consist, as the screw, the nut, the pare-tree and the chase, etc. it hath also his adiuncts belonging to it, as the Inck and the Inck-bals etc. which said parts and adiuncts of the Presse considered, with the printed papers, bookes and impressions which are the saleable Emporeutick workes. I say in this respect they are called Instruments and meanes whereby printed Bookes are atteined vnto.
R 72. Define a practick of an Inuention.
A The practick of an Inuention is that which is made in reall parts and adiunct, according to the description of the Theorick of an inuention.
So if you describe an Iron furnace by euery part and adiunct which belongeth therunto, such a discription
is called the Theorick of a Furnace, but afterward if you make a real Furnace, either of moddle, stuffe or of brick, clay, or earth, according to the description and Theorick proportions, then such a Furnace is called the practick of a Furnace, the like may be said of any other Mechanick or Engin.
R. 73. What cannons haue you of an inuention in respect of the Theorick.
A. The Theorick of an Inuention is to be described by his parts and adiuncts that other mens labours and indeauors bee incroached vppon or forestalled thereby.


CAP. 11. An Inuention triable and vntriable conformable and inconformable, Royall and Coppy-hold.
R.
74 WHat other kindes or sorts haue you of an Inuention.
A. An Inuention is two fould, An Inuention of discouery, or an inuention of experiment, or an Inuention is triable, or vntriable.
R. 75. What call you a triable Inuention.
A. A triable Iuuention is an inuention whose worth and goodnesse cannot certainly appeare before trialls and experiments be made, not only in the moddles thereof, but also in the Protop last it selfe.
Of this sort, are all the Inuentions Metallicall, comprised in the Patent and also the Inuention called the Register for generall commerce.

 R. 76. Define an inuention vntriable.
A. An vntryable inuention is a new proiect or discouery, whose worth and goodnesse requireth no tryals, but may bee iudged and discerned onely by the discription or declaration of the plot and proiect.
Of this sort are all Monopolies, new customes, imposts, taxations, subsidies, statutes, with fines, and diuers other state businesses, discoueries and inuentions, which are ordinarily propounded or petitioned of his Maiestie.
Of this sort is Sepherica, a late inuention of the Authours, the proiect and contents whereof shall be handled in a treatise called Sepherica.
R. 77. How many sorts of tryable inuentions are there.
A. An inuention tryable is either conformeable or inconformeable.
R. 78. Define a conformeable inuention.
A. A conformeable inuention is an inuention tryable which reformeth and bettereth a former inuention (requiring but some small and not chargeable alteration) after that the new is vnited to the ould.
So the Iron furnaces, fineries and chafferies may be much reformed and bettered with small charges, hauing our Ferricall inuention vnited to them, and therefore the Ferricall inuention is fitly called a conformeable inuention.
R. 79. What Cannons or rules haue you for a conformeable inuention.

 A. Conformeable inuention being priueledged is farre more beneficiall and commodious to the Pattentees and the dealers in that busines, the^ an inconformable inuention, and the reason is because that imediatly after the grand tryals are brought to passe and performed in the Protoplast, they may choose whether they will be at any further charge, and yet they may raise present rent and benefit by conforming of the former inuentions to the Protoplast, and not at theirs, but onely at the charges of the owners of former works and inuentions.
R. 80. Define an inconformable inuention.
A. An inuention is said to be inconformable whose Protoplast being erected and set vp, cannot be conformed to any former inuention in vse, where by yearely profits of conformity may be raised without charges to the Pattentees and dealers.
So the presseware inuention maketh tiles and brickes, and all other clayworks, after a farre more gainefull and beneficiall manner then by the ordinary course, yet neuerthelesse it is an inconformable inuention, because that the ordinary Arts of tilemaking and brick-making cannot bee conformed vnto the Presse-ware Protoplast with some small alterations and small charges.
R. 81. What Cannons or Rules haue you of an inconformable inuention.
A. An inconformable inuention requireth a great stocke and great disbursements for the Pattentees,
to lay out, aswell for the Protaplest as also for some two or three grander Mechanicks thereof.
Secondly an inconformable inuention after the erection and perfection of the Protoplast in continewance of time, may raise great rents and fines by licences, leases and deuises though no by present conformity.
R. 82. What other distribution haue you for an inuention Mechanicke.
A. An inuention Mechanicke, is either priuiledged or vnpriuiledged, againe it is either a royaltie or a coppy-hould.
A royaltie is such a new businesse, which in regard of the greatnesse thereof belongeth peculiarly to the King.
Or a royaltie is an inuention Mechanicke which produceth extraordinarie and worthie yearely profits and reuenewes, whose valuation exceedeth the summe of ten thousand pounds. per annum.
R. 83. Define a coppy-hould inuention.
A. A Coppy-hould is an inuention whose yearely valuation and worth exceedeth not the summe of ten thousand pounds. per annum.
84. What cannons or rules haue you concerning royall or coppy-hould Inuentions.
A. These Cannons belong to a Royall Inuention, first, no subiect or subiects, of what estate or degree soeuer by his seruice or demerit, except the Queene mother, the Kings children, is capeable of a whole entire royaltie, and therefore if the King haue passed away
way a royaltie, ignorantly, he may iustly recall and reuoke his graunt.
Secondly, a subiect may by his seruice to his Prince and Country, demerit part or portion of a royaltie, it being no greater then a Coppy-hould.
R. 85. What Cannons or Rules belong to a Mechanicke in respect of priuiledge or impriueledge.
A. First, it is most reasonable and fitting that a Mechanicke inuention should be priueledged for a certaine time wholly to the Inuentioner and Authour, if so be it be but of the yearely valew of a Coppy-hould.
Secondly, the first Inuentor of a Royaltie though of meane degree hath as great demerit in the inuention, as any other subiect of what estate or degree soeuer, excepting Royall persons.
R. 86. What Cannons or rules haue you concerning Royalties.
A. There are diuers other rules and obseruations which I spare to speake of at this time, because at further leasure I purpose to Print a little Tractate of Royalties and coppy-houlds, which is a parcel of this treatise of Metallita.


CAP. 12. Cannons or rules seruing to iudge of the goodnesse of a deriuatine Inuention Emporeuticall.
R
87 How may those who are willing to deale in the triall of new inuentions iudge of their goodnes.

 A. There are many infallible Rules by which if a diriuatiue Inuention be examined, wee may easily iudge of the goodnesse thereof, but to reduce this doctrine to some head, we are to consider both the generall vertues, and generall faults in inuentions.
R. 88. What are the generall virtues by which an Inuention is to be examined.
The vertues of an Inuention are of two degrees, the lesser and the greater, and each degree is three-fould.
R. 89. Which are the lesser virtues of a deriuatiue Inuention.
A. These three, Equi sufficiencie, Equi-cheapenes, Equi excellency.
R. 90. What meane you by Equi-sufficiencie.
A. Equall sufficiencie is when the new Inuention or Emporeuticke is as sufficient and as good for vse as the ould.
So Printed bookes are as sufficient and as good to reade as written Manuscripts, and the meale grinded by the winde-milne, is as good and sufficient to make bread as that which is grinded by the water-milnes, and earthen pipes by the Pressorian Art, being well made are as strong to hould and conuey water as leaden pipes or potters pots, which two kindes of water conueiances werein vse long before presse-ware pipes were inuented.
R. 91. What meane you by the second virtue which you cal equi-cheapenesse.
A. The new Emporeuticke is said to haue equicheapenes,
cheapenes, when as it may be sould and vttered as cheape as the ould commoditie or inuention which was in vse before.
So if Printing bookes be but as cheape to be sould as manuscript bookes, then they are said to haue equicheapenes.
And if Tiles made by the Pressorian Art may bee afforded to be sould and vttered as cheape as the tiles made by the ould and ordinary way, then the Presseware Tiles may well be said to haue Equi cheapenes with ordinary Tiles.
R. 92. What meane you by the third virtue which you call Equi-excellency.
A. The new Inuention is said to haue Equi-excellencie with the ould, when it hath in it the same beautie and perfection that the ould commodity of sale hath, and in the same degree, measure and equallitie.
So if Muscouie glasse be as cleare, transparent and excellent as greene glasse for windowes, then in regard of the beautie and perfection of the substance it is said to bee Equi-excellent.
R. 93. Which are the greater virtues of an inuention.
A. These three, more sufficiency, more cheapnesse, more excellency, all which are easie to be vnderstood, by their lower degrees described before.
R. 94. Which are the lesser faults of an Inuention deriuatiue.
A. There are three in number, lesse sufficiencie, lesse cheapenesse lesse excellency.

 R. 95. Which are the greater faults of an Inuention.
A. There are also three, insufficiency, exceeding dearnesse, exceeding basenesse, vglinesse or ill fauourednesse,
R. 96. What Cannons or rules haue you to iudge of a deriuatiue Inuention, by comparing these vertues and saults to gether.
A. There are many, whereof these following serue to iudge of the vnworthinesse.
R. 97. What is the first Cannon.
A. If an Emporeutick haue only in it all the smaller vertues, although it may be esteemed commendable for a new inuention, then surely it will do no good to be set vp and followed:
So if any clay-worke made by Presse-ware art, as namely tile, slate, free-stone, paning stone, archings. etc. or greene glasse made by Seacoale, If these two new inuentions fal out to be but Equi-sufficient, Equi-cheape and Equi-excellent, with old Inuentions of tiles, slates, free stone, pauing stones, archings etc. then surely there will be no good to be done by them, because they yeeld no benefit to the common wealth.
R 98. What is your second Cannon to iudge of the worthlessnesse of an Inuention.
A. If a new Inuention of sale haue in it but all the smaller faults only, it is not to be commended nor euer will prooue good, for example, if one should deuise a Water-worke, to raise waters, which is lesse
sufficient for that purpose, and more chargeable to be erected, and in regard of excellency more imperfect then the ordinary raising of waters in vse, I say such an Emporcutick is to bee iudged a worthlesse Inuention.
R. 99. What is the third directory Cannon.
A. If a new inuention, compared with the old, be found to haue in it but one of the grander faults, although it be accompanied with some one or two of the grand, vertues, yet is it to be reiected for starke naught, for there can no good be made of it, for instance sake say that one hath deuised to make windowing of the pure mettle of Venice-glasse, or of the pure substance of Christall, which is not impossible to be done, This his sale Mechanick will be exceeding deere and costly, And therefore although it be more excellent or stronger, or more sufficient then the ordinary kind of windowing by greene glasse, yet the Inuentioner will neuer do good of it, except it bee to begger himselfe, and all that shall deale in it: for a scrap of coloquintida, I say, marreth a whole messe of good pottage.
R. 100. How many directory triplicities is there of this Rule.
A. There are,
First exceeding deerenesse, more sufficiency, more excellency.Secondly insufficiency, more cheapnesse, more excellency.Thirdly vnsightly basenesse, more sufficiency, more cheapnesse.
This last triplicity although it hath two good grand vertues, yet the buyers of this Emporeutick will not deale with it, because they cannot abide to behold it.
R. 101. What other triplicities are there of this Cannon.
A. Three by one grand vertue, and three by another, which for breuities sake I omit.
R. 102. What other Cannons haue you to iudge of the worthlessnesse of an Inuention.
A. If an Inuention containe all the grander vertues, and yet tend to the vtter confusion of Kingdoms and Ciuill Estates, then is it by no meanes to bee attempted or enterprized by any Inuentioner, Of this kind is the Inuention to walk inuisible, if such a deuice may be attained vnto, to make a barge or ship to flye as well in the ayre as to saile vpon the water.
R. 103. What Cannons or Rules haue you to iudge of the goodnesse and worth of a deriuatiue Inuention.
A There are many Cannons likewise for this purpose, all which are grounded vpon triplicities of the former vertues or lesser faultes, or intermixt of both.
R. 104. What is the first Cannon.
A. An Inuention that hath none of the grand faults and hath at the least one of the grand vertues, or more in his triplicity, then is it to be esteemed good and valuable as it apeareth by al these subsequent triplicities.

 R. 105. Recite the triplicitie of this Cannon.
1. A. More sufficiency, Equi-cheapnesse, Equi-excellency.
As for example, earthen tileage is more sufficient and durable, equi-cheape and equi-excellent then the old way of couering of houses by woodden pannells, when wood and timber was then as plentifull in England as is now in Virginia or new found land, and therefore a very good Inuention.
2 Equi-sufficiency, more cheapenesse, Equi-excellency.
3. Equi-sufficiency, Equi-cheapnesse, more excellency.
4. Equi-sufficiency, more cheapnesse, lesse excellency.
5. Lesse-sufficient, more cheape, Equi-excellent.
Of this sort is Lees Inuention of loome stockings, and the tillage of ground by Plough and harrow, comparing it with Adams old tillage with spade and Iron rake, which Gardners still vse.
6. More sufficiency, Equi-cheapnesse, lesse excellency.
7. More Excellency, lesse-cheapnesse, Equi-excellency.
8. Equi-sufficiencyl, esse cheapnesse, more excelency.
9. Lesse-sufficiency, Equi-cheapnesse, more excellency.
10. More sufficiency, more cheapnesse, Equi-excellency.
11. More sufficiency, more cheapnesse, less excelency.
 12. Equi-sufficiencie, more cheapnesse, more excellency.
13. Lesse sufficiencie, more-cheapnesse, more-excellency.
14. More sufficiency, Equi-cheapnes, more excellencie.
15. More sufficiency, lesse-cheapnesse, more-excellency.
16. More sufficiency, more cheapnesse, more-excellency. Which is the best and most eminent of all other triplicities.


CAP. 13. Metallicall Instruments defined with their seuerall kindes. Lenicks, Presse-wares and mouldes described.
Reader.
106. THe Manuscript Treatise or Schedules annexed to the Indenture, as it seemeth, comprehendeth many worthy matters and excellent inuentions, but it is some-what obscure and obstruce, both by reason that some points are implicitely set downe, and also in respect of some strange and hard words which I doe not perfectly conceiue or vnderstand: I pray you therefore enlarge and describe the same Materiall points, in a more familiar phrase and stile, that such plaine men as my selfe, who are willing to deale and aduenture in these your inuentions, may
more fully vnderstand the purport and goodnesse of your businesse.
A. Sir you neede not be offended with the scholasticall tearmes, for it hath alwaies beene lawfull to the Authours of new Arts and inuentions at their owne pleasure to giue names to their new Arts, instruments and deuises which are not so vulgarly knowne. Goe but to a Printer, and you shall heare many strange words of his inuention and misterie, as namely Charrecters, the Compositer, the Long-primer, the Pica, the Italica, the Chase, etc, the like tearmes you shall finde in diuerse other trades in London.
I hope therefore I shall not be barred or denyed of that libertie of making choice of words of Arts, for new matters, which is giuen and allowed vnto euery tradesman in his owne scyence and mistery.
Indeede I confesse that some points are more closely and briefely touched of purpose, and the reason was, because I had often promised to explaine and illustrate them in the printed treatise, and it would haue bin both tedious and more chargeable to haue drawne the manuscript in a prolixe and ample sort.
Neuerthelesse to the intent that no iust exceptions may be taken, and that the meanest capacitie may perceiue my meaning, I will be ready to explaine and amplifie the seuerall contents of my Pattents in as plaine and easie mannner as I can thinke or deuise.

 R. 107. It is euident by your Pattent, that all Mechanick Artes and Inuentions which performe their worke by the helpe and opperation of Metallicall Instruments, are all of them priuiledged businesses vnto you. Wherefore I pray you describe at large all the sorts of Metallicall Instruments and meanes, which are the strength, nerues, and sinewes of your priuiledge.
A. The Instruments and meanes Metallicall, which are vsed for the producing of Metalique Materialls, or things are (as it was shewed before) of two sorts, Common and Peculiar.
The Common Instruments are such which are borrowed from other trades, occupations, and mysteries, amongst which wee haue especially vse of Smithes, Ioyners, Turners, not onely of their instruments and tooles, but also of their Emporeuticks which they ordinarily make, as Presses, Vices, Screwes, Bellowes, Tongs, etc. made either of Iron and wood, or of both together.
R. 108. What call you the peculiar Metallicall Instruments.
A. The Peculiar Instruments are those that are of the Authors Inuention, being of chiefe and principall vse for the working of Metallicall effects, when they are vsed and conioyned with other Common Instruments, and they are of two sorts, Principall, and Lesse principall.
The principall are those which in the Manuscript are called by the names of Lenick, Plegnick, and Camminicks.

 R. 129. Define the Metallicall Instruments, which are called by the name of Lenicks.
A. The Lenicks are peculiar Metallicall instruments, which worke their opperation and effect, by pressing, impressioning or moulding, and that either by thrusting or drawing.
R. 110. What call you the Emporeutick materials which are made by these Lenick Instruments.
A. The Materials that are made and brought forth by these pressing and moulding instruments, are called Press-wares or mould-wares.
R. I pray you set downe the definition of Pressewares or Mould-wares together, with their seuerall sorts or kindes.
Presse-ware or Mould-ware, is any thing that can bee made, wrought, or formed of clay and earth, not by hand and the round table, as the Potters vse, nor after the common manner of Tile-making and Brick-making, but by presse and mould, or by pressing and moulding.
There bee many sorts or kindes of Press wares by reason of different figures, and diuerse vses vnto which they are to bee applied, all which kinds are reduced to these two heads: Rude-ware and Pollisht-ware.

Rude-ware.
RVde-ware are such sorts of Presse-ware which after they are pressed and moulded, require no further ornament.

Pipeage is the principall branch of Press-ware, and it is nothing else but the making of earthen pipes, for the conducting and sweeter conueighing of fresh waters, for the seruiceable vse of houses.
Field Pondeage, is a kinde of Pipeage, which from higher springs and fountaines conueigheth and distributeth water into seuerall pastures, closes and fields, and in euery one of the said places, maketh and leaueth a pond of water for cattle and beasts to drinke in, this kinde is very necessary for country townes, where there are but some few springs, and many hundred of inclosed pastures, which in the heate of Summer want waters.
And Kennellage is one of the chiefe kinds of Pipeage which passeth and voydeth away the stincking and filthy waters of citties and townes vnder earth into the common ditches or sewers, and this kinde is very necessary for the auoiding of noysome and infectious ayres, especially in the heate of Summer.
Of Presse-wares also are made Pumpes, as sufficient as those of Lead or Wood, and farre lesse chargeable.
Welleage is a kind of Press ware for the speedy making of Wells, farre cheaper then the rounds, which are made of Brick to keepe the earth from falling downe.
Priuy Funnels or Vaults, may aso bee made by the Press-ware Art so close and so sweete that there can no annoyance or vnfauory smels euapoure out or presse through them. This kind of Presse-ware is very necessary for many houses in the citty, which are
much annoyed by the leaking and sincking through the funnels of Brick.
As Walls are made of ordinary Bricks, so may they be made of Press-wares more handsome, cheaper and dureable.
Open Gutters are made by the Press-ware way, which may serue betweene houses instead of Lead, or in Fields to conduct and lead away water, or on the Eues of houses or Pent-houses.
The Press ware Arte-likewise, ministrech a kinde of Tiling and Slates for the couering of houses more substantiall and dureable then those that are made by the ordinary way of Tiling, or then those blew and hewen Slates which are digged out of the Slate Quarries.
Spouts ordinarily are made of Lead, and hanged on the out-side of the walls, but Spouteage may more conueniently be made of pipes, brought downe within the middest of the Brick walls, for to couueigh raine water into the sincks vnder the earth.


Pollisht-ware.
POllished-ware, are such sorts of Presse-wares, which after they are pressed and moulded, receiue further ornament and beauty, by Turners, Ioyners or engrauors tooles, or by Turning, Planing, or engrauing, and there are three degrees of this ornament, for else it is meerely by cutting off the edge, when the Presse-ware of Clay is liuer dry, or else by repressing againe,
which is when they Presseware is figured or fashioned the second or third time with the mould againe. The third degree is by fire, colouring, which is the glaring, glazing or leading of the Presse-ware, this addeth a super-excellent grace and lustre to the worke, if it be well and curiously done and performed, and it hath in it this singular prerogatiue. For whereas freestone greeneth presently with the first wet and raine and after in continuance of time becometh ouergrowne with mosse, or else moulteth or crometh away, but this sort of Pollished ware continueth alwaies in his natiue and liuely hew, neuer tainting or altering with any weather, no more then the stone Iugs or Cruses, which we vsually drinke out of.
Of Pressewares also we may make all kinde of pauingstones larger and greater then those which are made by Potters or Tilers, which kinde is very seruiceable. for pauing of houses, galleries, ouens, courts, and furnaces.
Fish-ponds may be both flored in the bottome and wainescotted on the sides by the Presse-ware Art, so sufficiently, that neither the earth can fall downe, nor the ouse or mudd to swell vp within. So likewise for bathes and baynes.
Spouts, ordinarily are made of leade, and hanged on the out-sides of the wals, but they may bee made of turned Pipes being also beautified with glazing, leading, or other ornaments, stamps or impressions.

 The like may be said of Windowing and Menyons for windowes, which may be made and cast of white clay, as sufficiently and substantially as of hewen bricke or Freestone.
Gardens, Squares, and Walkes are vsually compassed and inuironed with railes and pales of wood or stone, this may also be done by Presse-ware, cheapor, stronger and handsommer.
In a word there is no part or appurtenances in buildings, which is made either of Bricke, Tile, Lead, Wood, Tarras, or Free-stone, which cannot more conueniently be made by the Pressing Art of casting, and the reason thereof is, because that mouldes may be made to cast all kinde of Solid shapes, figures, and bodies whatsoeuer.
So that from hence also we may make Bullets, Globes, Coping stones, Archings, Pillars, Columnes, Finishings Chimney Fannels, Mantletrees, or Clauels for Chimnies, Cesternes, Coppers to brew in, Wainescoaring for Chambers, and such other like things, and Vtensils.
R. 112. What are the generall and chiefe instruments of making of Pressewares-
A. The instruments of Pressing and moulding, which are vsually called by the names of Presse and mould.
R. 113. How many kinde of Presses or Pressing Instruments are there.
A. Pressing or impressioning of things is performed by diuers meanes, as namely by beating, stamping, knocking, or falling.

 Secondly, by screwing or viceing. Thirdly by the drawing of flexible girths or cordes. Examples of all which sorts, are to bee seene at my worke-house at Highbury, in the parish of Islington neere London.
R. 114. What call you a moulding instrument, mould or moulder.
A. A Mould or Moulder, is an artificiall instrument which mouldeth, figureth, and proportioneth the tempered earth, which beeing forced, passeth thorough the mould.
R. 115. How many sorts are there of Moulds or Moulders.
A. Moulds are of two sorts, for either they are as long as the Pressware, which they make and figure, of which sort are all those which are called by the names of scouring moulds at the Worke house at Highbury, or else they are shorter then the presse-wares which they make, wherevpon they are called Short Mouldes. Diuers sorts both of long mouldes and short moulds, are to be seene at the said Workehouse, and therefore I will not further enlarge or describe them heare, but referre the Reader to see them at the place aforenamed.
R. 116. When a presse and a short mould are in one frame vnited together, what is the fittest name to call that instrument by.
A. It may aptly in a word be called a Presse-mould, which is further described and handled in the next chapter.




CAPVT. 14. The Pressmould: and the Plegnick Instruments defined.
R.
117 DEscribe therefore the Press-mould by his end and vse.
A. A Press-mould is a pressing and moulding Instrument for the making of all kind of Press-wares, that is to say, all kind of tiles, bricks, pauing-stones, furnace-stones, or any kind of clay-worke or tempered earths whatsoeuer.
R. 118. Describe the Press-mould by his parts and adiuncts.
A. The Press-mould consisteth of these generall parts.

1. Two clay-boxes.
2. Two Receit tables.
3. One Screw.
4. Two Pressours.
5. Foure Anti-pressoures.
6. Two Nutboxes.
7. Two squease tables.
8. Two Coane spits.
9. Two Screw posts.
10. Frames for the said parts.
11. Driers and Rammers, which are adiuncts.

There are many sorts and differences of Press-moulds, euery sort consisting of different parts and adiuncts,
All which shall be at large described in the second edition of Metallica, or in the Appendix, or addition vnto this treatise called Pressoria.
In the meanewhile if any be desirous to see both this Presse-mould, Engin and the working thereof, at Highbury, and at Islinton, he may haue diuerse sorts of them, which in an Artificiall manner doe make all kinde of Clayworkes with extraordinary speed and readinsse.
R. 119. I vnderstand what you meane by Lenicke Instruments, I pray shew what vse they haue in Iron businesse.
A. First, the Lenicke Instruments ferue very fitly for the tempering, stamping, and comixing of Seacole, or Stone-cole, that a kinde of substance being there made of them like vnto past or tempered clay, the Presse-mould may sorme and tranfigure that clay-like substance into hollow pipe. cole as it doth earthen pipes.
Now this pipe-coale is of very good vse for the making and working of some kinds of Irons and steeles.
Secondly the Lenicke Instrument serueth very fitly for the breaking and brusing, stamping and beating, tempering and impastening of all kinde of Iron oares, whereby they are prepared for the Furnace in a very beneficiall manner and course, for when this impasted oare is by the-engin of the Presse-mould Intubated and formed into pipes, as if it were Clay or loame, These oare-pipes being made hollow and full of holes are sooner melted and consumed by the heate of the
furnace and with farre smaller charges of fewell or firing then the ordinary oare which Founders put into their furnace in peeces or gobbits as great as wallnuts.
R. 120. You hauing handled sufficiently the doctrine of the Lenickes or Pressing instruments, I pray you proceede end shew me what you meane by Plegnickes, which your Maunscript maketh the second kinde of your Metallicall Instruments.
A. Plegnicks and Metallicall instruments which performe their opperation and effect by meanes of their dexterous and artificiall ioynt-mouing.
R. 121. How many kindes of Plegnicke instruments be there.
A. There are fiue kindes of Plegnicke engins or Machins, the Plegnicke Bellowes, the Plegnicke Milne the Plegnicke Schrew, and the Plegnicke Rombus, and the Reciprocall Plegnicke.
R. 122. What odds and prerogatiue differences is there betweene the ordinary bellowes (which Smithes and Mettle-founders daily vse) and your new deuised Plegnicke bellowes.
A. There are many differences, first the Plegnicke bellowes is more handsomely and strongly made, then ordinary refining bellowes, and with farre lesse expence of leather, for here the leather is not closely nailed vpon the wood, but strongly grasted and incorporated into the very substance of the timber, so that by this meanes the ioytning of the leather and the wood together, is as thite and close as the substance
of the boords themselues.
Secondly the Plegnick bellowes may be made to blow and streame forth not only could wind and ayre (which is all that ordinary bellowes can doe) but also to blow and send forth flames of fire, water, vapours and dust, all which is very necessary for the blowing of Metallicque substances, as shall be at large shewed in the second Edition or in the Appendix called Plegnica.
Thirdly the Plegnick bellowes may so be made and contriued, to blow ten times more then the ordinary bellowes, and that either by moouing ten times faster, or else by being made ten times greater.
R. 123. What odds and prerogatiue differences is there betweene the ordinary Milnes and your new deuised Plegnick Milnes.
A. The Plegnick Milnes haue many prerogatiues and conueniences which the ordinary Milning lacketh: and to begin with the Wind milne.

First the ordinary Wind-milne hath nor only his sailes mounted vp in the wind, but also the work-house wherin the Milne-stones and the Cogg-wheeles grind the corne, by which meanes they are subiect to bee blowne downe with stormes, but the Plegnick Wind-milne hath his worke-house vpon the firme ground, by meanes whereof you may make your Roomes as wide and as large as you will without any hazard or danger of blowing downe.
Secondly the crosse sailes of the Wind-milne doe mooue verte callter, as they cal it, or through the zeneth
or the nader; wherevppon ariseth this inconuenience that the Wind-milne must be turned and haled about continually as the wind changeth, but the Plegnick Wind-milne hath his crosse-sailes ouer the top of the work-house, and they flye round about with a circular motion, paralel to the Horizon: whereby it is ready for all windes without turning or haling about.
Thirdly this Plegnick deuise may be made to go with three or foure paire of Milne-stones at once, whereas the wind-milne can go only but with one paire, and by this meanes the Plegnick Wind-milne will grind three or foure times more meale in an houre, especially in a good gale of wind.
Fourthly the Wind-milne grindeth only corne, and cannot be made to do any other worke, as the water-milne doth, but the Plegnick engin doth all manner of workes, it will grind corne as well as the Wind-milne, it will serue for the Iron furnace to blow the bellowes as well as the ordinary Water-milne, and finally to do any other worke which the Water-milne or Horse-milne doth.
Fiftly the Wind milne standeth still in a calme and when the wind serueth not, for there is no meanes to make it goe but by wind, but the Plegnick milne is perpetuall, for when the wind serueth not, it is made to go with horse, and in a small gale of wind the horse may help to draw and mooue it faster.
Sixtly there are also many other conueniences in the Plegnick Water-milne ouer and aboue the ordinary water milne as more at large shall bee shewed in the
second edition of this treatise.

R. 124. How many sorts of Plegnick milnes are there in regard of the force that mooueth the Engin.
There are fiue sorts of Plegnick milnes, The first is called the Horswin because it mooueth both with horse and wind, the second kind is called the Horsewater because it goeth both by horse and water, The third kind is called the windwater, because the Wind and the water mooueth the engin ioyntly together.
The fourth kind is called the Horswinwater because it is mooued with horse, wind and water alltogether, and at one time. The fist kind is called the water Plegnick which mooueth either inuisibly and secretly vnder the water and by the water with one rong wheele or elce with two Horizontall wheeles aboue the water.
R. 125. Did you euer make any of these Plegnick milnes to experiment their goodnesse by triall.
A. I haue made diuers milne engins to go both by wind and water, in the moddle, but not in the grand Mechanick, and I haue at this present a horswin now framing at Highbury, which the next terme God willing shall stand vppon some Turret in London neere vnto the Thames side, where all passengers by water may see it goe and mooue continually. I haue also at Pickle herring ouer against the Tower a water. legnick which mooueth only by the water, and goeth very swift with two paire of Milne-stones, whosoeuer
is desirous to see it may haue it there at a ship-Carpenters yard vppon the Wharfe. And thus much of the Plegnick milne.
R. 126. Define the Plegnick Screw, the Plegnick Rhombus, and the reciprocall Plegnick, which are the three last kinds of your Plegnick Engins.
A. The plegnick screw is an engin whose spirall line mooueth with one motion, two vice nutts or Matrixes at the same time, which no other screw did before, This plegnick screw is very auaileable in Metallicall workes, aboue any other ordinary screw, which hath beene vsually in the common wealth, but especially it is very conuenient for tempering, beating and impastening of all kind of oares and pitcoales
The plegnick Rhombus is an Engin of extraordinary and admirable power and faculty, and in regard of quick and speedy motion there was neuer any Machin yet deuised, which commeth neere vnto it.
The Reciprocall Plegnick is an Engin that hath wheeles running reciprocally, turning backwards and forewards by one great wheele that mooueth but one way at the same time which kind of reciprocal motion was neuer done or performed before by any other Engin.
This reciprocall is of great vse for the battering and beating of Iron, lattin, plate, copper, or any other mettles.

 If any be desirous to be further certified concerning the truth of the admirable motions, opperations and workes of these three engins, let them repaire to Highbury, and it shall be enidently shewed and demonstrated vnto them, in diuers reall moddles and examples.


CAP. 15. Caminicke instruments, as fewels, liquours and furnaces defined.
127. Hauing described the Lenicke and Plegnicke instruments, I pray you proceed to the third kinde of Metallicall instruments, which you call by the name of Caminicks.
A. Caminicks are peculiar Metallicall instruments, which performe their opperation and effect by their new kinde of furnacing and hearthing.
R. 128. How many kindes of Caminicke instruments be there which serue for the making of all kinde of Irons and other mettles and materials.
A. There are three kindes, the fewell, the liquor, and the furnace.
R. 129. Define fewell.
A. Fewell is any substance combustible being apt or fit to burne, or to make, or take fier.
R. 130. Rehearse the seuerall kindes and sorts of fewell.

 A. There are three sorts of Fewell, whereof fire is made: Wood-fewell, which is either Char-coale or vnburnt Wood-fewell. Secondly Pit-coale or Earthcoale, and thirdly Brush-fewel.
Char-cole is the Principall and best for vse, but by reason of scarsity it is growne very deare in our country.
Earth-coale is that kinde of fewell of siring, which is digged out of the bowels of the earth, or else vpon the superficies of the earth, of which sort also there are many kindes, hauing difference in their burning. The Scottish coale is the best flamer, and consumeth away into white ashes, as hauing in it more vnctiousnesse then sulpharousnesse. The New-Castle coale, vsually called Sea-coale, is more lasting and dureable then the Scottish, for beeing stirred vp, it will make a secondary or third fire, whereas the Scottish-coale consumeth at once; For which cause all Brewers and artificers of London rather vse this sort. Howbeit it is not so fit for some Metalique purposes as Scottish-coale, by reason of the more aboundant heauy sulpherous substance remaining in it.
Turffe and Peate maketh a third kinde of earth-coale, and if they haue any sulpharousnesse in them, it is not so heauy and fretting as that which is in the Sea-coale and Stone-coale, the Low-countries vse for the most part this kinde of fewell, insteed of wood and sea-coale.
Brush-fewell is the third kind of firing, which is neither of the inward substance of the earth, nor of the vpper superficies as Sea-coale and Turffe is, but groweth vpon the earth in a brushie or twiggie manner, of this sort is all kinde of stubble, Baueings, Straw, Furs, Fearne, Ling, Heath, with other stalkes, of hearbes,
weeds, and vnder-shrubs, all which burne with great flames, yet are they of no great heate or long continuance. Vnder Brush-fewell, wee comprehend also an other sort, which is not so much vsed for firing, as for lights, as namely, oyles, tallowes, waxes, which are vsed in lampes and candles. Secondly, pitch, rossen, turpentine, tarre, mastick, with such like liquids and gums, as issue and proceed from trees beeing combustible. This kind of fewell is most fit for the Ventignoll Mechanick, which hath good and profitable vse for many purposes, where other fewell is not so fit.
R. 131. What meanes are to be vsed to make earth-coale as seruiceable for Metalique purposes, as wood or Char-coale.
A. There are three sorts, the first is to bring earth-coale to that equallity of heat, that wood or charcoale hath, that is to say, that it maketh neither hotter nor coulder fire then wood or Charcoale doth: the second meanes, is so to order and prepare pit-coale, that all nociue proprieties, which are aversse from all Metalique substances, may be abstracted from it, or at least destroyed in it. The third meanes is the Addition and infusion of those deficient proprieties, which as they are in char-cole, so ought they to be found in pit-cole.
R. 132. What meane you by Caminicke-liquores.
A. By Caminicke-liquores I vnderstand diuers kinds of intermixt and compounded waters for the lauing, washing and steeping of all kinde of mettle-Ewres to cause them the better to yeeld and giue downe their liquid mettle from their slaggs and cinders.
So that as the Gould-smith hath his waters which will segar gould from siluer, and the Allom-maker his vrines for the segaring and bringing downe of his allomes,
so these Caminicke-liquoures are very behoofefull and effectfull for the steeping and tempering of oares, which being thereby prepared, they will the more easily let downe their pure mettle being seuered and abstracted from the recrement and drosse of the cinder and the slagg.
R. 133. Define a furnace.
A. A surnace is a Caminicke instrument made and built of furnace-earth; or a furnace is the Artificiall receptacle of fier and fewell, for boyling, nealing, and backing of all kinde of Rawe-materials or Rawe-matters.
R. 134. How many kindes of Rawe-matters are there for furnaces to worke vpon.
A. There are fiue sorts of Rawe-matters, the mettle-matter, the liquour-matter, the fiery earth-matter, the dry matter and compounded-matter.
R. 135. Describe more plainely these seuerall kinds of Rawe-matters.
A. The Mettle-matter is that Mettellar substance which is put into the Furnace to be baked, boyled or nealed, which in one word may be called the Mettellar.
R. 136. How many kindes of Mettellars are there
A. There are three sorts of Mettellars.
The first is the raw or baked oare, as it is digged out of the earth, which being put into the furnace melteth downe into two substances, the one is called the Glass-slag, and th'other the Sowe-liquour.
The Glasse-slage is a liquid materiall of a glassie substance being tough, thicke, and ropy, like bird-lime, it swimmeth vpon the superficies of the sowe liquour, as barme doth vpon beare, or creame vpon milke.

 The second kinde of Mettellar is the sowe of Iron which when the hearth or furnace hath receiued it, it melteth downe into two substances, whereof one is called Ferrica substantiae, or the Iron substance, the other is called the cinder or after-slagg.
The after-slagg is a liquid materiall which inhereth in the Ferrica-substantiae, as whey doth in a posset, or crudds.
The Ferrica-substantiae is tougher then the liquour of the alter-slagg, which when it is battred vnder the stroke and presse of the hammer, the after-slagg is squeased and pressed out, and so the substance is made and becometh good Iron, euen as the whey is wrung out by the violence of the Presse, and so the cruds are made into a cheese.
The third kinde of Mettellar is the could Iron, which when the fordge, furnace or hearth receiueth it, it is nealed and heated into glowing Iron, which glowing Iron afterward is forged by the Smith into diuers Emporeutickes for many-fould vses and purposes, as namely into kniues, horse-shooes, Iron-weapons, windowe barres, window case-ments, and into a thousand such like Emporeuticks, whereby Smiths get their liuing and maintenance.
R. 137. In the definition of your Furnace, you make mention of Furnace-earths, I pray you what meane you by them.
A. Furnace-earth, is any earthy substance, beeing made and prepared of stone, clay, or lome, that so it may become the fit and sufficient matter for the Caminick Furnace.
R. 138. How many kindes of Furnace-earths are there where, withall you build vp your Furnaces.

 There are three sorts of Furnace-earths. The first is the clay-pipes made of white clay, being tempered, wrought, and impastned with the dusts and pouders of diuers other things. The second kinde of Furnace-earth, is the clammy morter, which is of the same substance and temper that the Clay pipes are. The third kinde of Furnace earth, is the Furnace-stone, which is made into diuers figures, formes and proportions by the Press-mould Art, and of the same matter that the other two kinds were made of before.
R. 139. Define the second kind of Rawe-matters, which you call the Liquour-matter.
A. The liquor matter is any kind of liquor or liqueable, whether it be cold or hot, which is put into the Furnace Pot, Kettle, Caldron or Copper, to be further heated, and boyled, as namely, all kinds of fatts, tallows, oyles, and all kinds of waters, whether simple or compound, as fresh-water, Sea-water, Alloms-water, Coppresse-water, and a thousand such kindes of liquours.
R. 140. Define the third kinde of Rawe-matters which you call fiery-earths.
A. Fiery-earth is any kind of earth or earthy substance besides the Mettler which before was described, as namely all kind of Rawe Presse-wares and burnt-earths, before they are burned, baked or nealed, neuerthelesse the Raweoare if it be but nealed or baked belongeth to this kinde.
R. 141. Define the fourth kinde of Rawe-matters which you call dry-matters.
A. Dry-matter is any kinde of Rawe-matter besides the three former which were described before, vnder this head wee comprehend all kinde of pastes for bread, malts, safrons, papers, wet cloathes etc.
R. 142. Define the fift kinde of Rawe-matter which
you call compounded matter.
A. Compounded matter is any two or more of the former kindes, comming and issuing from one furnace and from one fire, together, and at the same time.
R. 143. Hauing thus handled and described the seuerall sorts of Rawe-matters, which are the things that the stomack of the Furnace worketh vpon, labouring to digest boile, and concoct them, I pray you now proceed to the distributions of the Frunace.
A. The Furnace in respect of the seuerall kinds of Raw-matters which it boileth and baketh, is likewise of fiue sorts and kinds, namely the Mettelar-furnace, the liquor-furnace the fier-earth-furnace; the dry-matter-furnace, and the compounded-furnace.
R. 144. Define these fiue seuerall sorts.
A. The Mettallar-furnace heateth, melteth and nealeth all kind of Mettallers, and so worketh them into their Emporeutick Materials, vnder this head is comprehended all kind of Iron Furnaces or hearths, for any other kind of mettles.
The descriptions of the other foure kindes of furnaces may easily be gathered by this, and therefore I referre the further explication of them vntill some other time.
R. 145. What odds and perogatiue differences are there between the ordinary furnaces which refiners and mettle-founders daily vse, and your new deuised Caminick furnaces. A. There are many differences both in regard of the forme and figure of making of them, as also in respect of other conueniences and prerogatiues, whereof these are principall.

1. First our Caminick Furnace is made and built vp of such dureable Furnace-matter, and continually maintained with such fier-resisting meanes, that it cannot possibly melt or burne down by any reuerberating flames or heates whatsoeuer.
2. Secondly, our Caminick Furnace is alwayes built
with some moueable part, as namely the dores, Fewel-beare, matter-beare and the Ash-beare, or any other part as wee please.
3. Thirdly our Caminick Furnace is built vp with glasse windowes for euery seuerall roome, so that thereby the Furnar may continually see and behold both his Rawe-matters and his Emporeutick Materials, and how his fire and Furnace worketh vpon them, which is a singular conuenience which our ordinary Furnaces want.

These forenamed differences and conueniences, with many others, shall be truly shewed and demonstrated in the seuerall examples of our Caminick Furnaces, which very shortly (God willing) shall be raised and built vp at Highbury and at Islington.
R. 146. What and how many are the generall parts of your furnace, which are to be fou^d in euery kind of your Camin.
A. These fiue, the dores, the windows, the fewell-beare, the Matter-beare, and the Ash beare.
1.2. The Dores are to shut and open, and so are also some of the Windowes.
3. The Matter-beare is a generall part of the Furnace, which bereth and holdeth the substa^ces of the Raw-matters.
4.5. The Fewell-beare, is a generall part of a Furnace which beareth and holdeth the fewel and fire, and the Ash-beare beareth the Ashes.
R. 147. What and how many are the roomes of your Furnace which are to be fou^d in euery kind of your Caminicks
A. There are foure seuerall roomes, which are to bee found in euery Furnace, the Ash-roome, the Fewell-roome, the Matter-roome, and the Vent-holes.
The ashroome receiueth and holdeth the ashes, the fewell roome, the fewell and firing. The matter-roome receiueth and holdeth the raw-matter. The lower-vent holes receiue and take in the aire, and the vpper vent-holes lets out the smoake

 R. 148. Hauing thus described your three principall Metallicall Instruments called by the names of Lenicks, Plegnicks, and Caminicks, I pray you describe your other Metallicall Instruments which you called before the Less-principall.
A. There are indeed diuers other Metallicall Instruments which are propper and peculiar of the Authors Inuention, all which shall be shewed and described vnto you in the second Edition.
R. 149. To what end and purpose do you publish the treatise of Metallica in print, which describeth and discouereth all the cheefe Instruments of your Inuentions.
A. There are diuers reasons which mooued the Author to describe publiquely to the view of the world these his Metallicall Arts and Inuentions.
Frst that it might appeare that his inuentions are new, and of his owne deuising, and not stolne from any other.
Secondly it is fit and reasonable that that which was granted in the Pattent by generall wordes and in an implicit manner should be so specially exprest and defined, that the endeauors and Inuentions of other men being different from his, might not be preuented by him.
Thirdly that none heereafter should presume to petition or trouble his Maiesty concerning any kind or kindes which are described and comprehended in his printed treatise of Metallica, which are all priueledged businesses vnto himselfe.
And lastly because the Author by Indenture from the Kings most excellent Maiesty is tied and enioyned to print and publish his booke of his new Metallicall Inuentions before the last day of Easter Terme, whereas he is not tyed to any time for the triall of his Inuentions.
