during which he be in such a ecstasy that for the s. edw. in a ecstasy space of almost two day he lie without any sign of life at length wake as it be out of a deep sleep he open his eye and sit up in

particular unto they by their honest his love to Benedictine monk conversation their holy life their sweet behaviour and their affable and courteous discourse these I more frequent visit their discourse be to my soul as sweet meat to my palate and these be some year since translate out of this world to the joy of heaven I behold in this my sleep stand before my face rehearse according to the will of God what shall befall this country after my decease they say that the wickedness of the english nation be grow so full and to such a height that it provoke God wrath and hasten his his prophecy of England revenge the priest have break their covenant with God they handle the sacred mystery with pollute soul and defile hand they be not true pastor but mercenaty that do no protect their flock but expose it to the devour jaw of wolf seek only their own private commodity of the milk and the wool neglect the good of their sheep that at last eternal death may just devour and swallow both sheep and shepherd in the bottomless pit of hell the prince allsoe and governor of the land be unfaithful companion of thief and waster of the country they neither sear God nor honour the law man to who truth be grievous and burdensome righteousness contemptible and cruelty delightful so that neither the prelate hear any respect to justice nor the subject have any regard of good order and discipline and therefore our lord and the come in of the norman have draw his dreadful sword he have bend and prepare his bow to shoote-forth the arrow of his just wrath and revenge against this

these great calamity upon they but with his wont piety will receive they then return unto his service who pervert from he by their wicked life he be prepare to punish and destroy with this heavy judgement no no reply they it will not fall out so happy for the heart of this miserable people be so harden their eye so blind and their ear so fast dam up against all goodness that they will neither hearken to any correction nor understand any good counsel they be neither with threat terrify from evil nor with benefit provoke unto good at these their word my grief and care increase what say I will our lord show his anger for ever will he not at last begin to be more pacify when then shall joy succeed these so many misery what comfort or consolation shall moderate psal 76. these great adversity what remedy be to be expect in these a obscure promise of God mercy towards England evil that as on the one side we be terrify and contristate at our future rebuke so we may be a little comfort with the promise of the divine mercy that follow they hereunto the saint propose unto i this parable when a green tree cut down from the stock and remove three furlong distant from his own root shall without the help of any man hand or by any external aid return again to his own root and place itself thereon shall resume juice again to flourish and bring forth fruit then and not before some comfort may be hope for in this tribulation and a remedy against the foretell adversity may be expect have say thus they return to heaven and I to you and myself again 24 while the king relate this vision there be present the queen Robert keeper of the sacred palace duke Harold and wicked Stigand who mount on his father bed have defile it impious invade the archiepiscopal sea of Canturbury during the life time of Robert true archkishop thereof for which offence he be afterward suspend by pope Alexander the second and in a council hold at Winchester by the same pope legate and other bishop and abbot of England he be both depose from all episcopal dignity and cast into prison by the command of William conqueror where he end his wicked life with a most miserable and well deserve death this Stigand be there present at the king narration have all the power of his soul so bar up against Stigand a clergyman punish for invade a sea belong to the Benedictine monk all goodness that he wax more obdurate at the dreadful story neither be he terrify with the threaten oracle nor give any credit to the pious relatour but murmur within himself that the king begin to dote in his old age he laugh where he have more cause to weep but the rest who mind be more virtuous give lament and weep abundant know very well that the prelate and prince lead their life according as the bless king have declare 25 some be of opinion that the foresay similitude be ground upon a impossibility and these be chief such as bewail that the whole nobility of the land be come to so low anebbe and so far spend that there be neither king nor bishop nor abbot nor prince of the same nation scarce to be see a interpretation of the king vision in England but quite of a other opinion be I say Alured especial that s. Dunstan do both foretell that this calamity shall befall we and yet afterward promise a comfortable redress thus than it may be expound this tree signify the kingdom of England in glory beautiful in delight and riches plentiful and in the excellency of the royal dignity most eminent the root from whence all this honour proceed be the royal stem or race which from alfred who be the first of the english king anoint and consecrate by the pope descend by a direct line of succession to s. EDWARD the tree be cut off from the stock when the kingdom be divide from this royal issue be translate to a other lineage the distance of three furlong show that during the reign of three king there shall be no mutual participation betwixt the new and the ancient race of king for Harold succeed king EDWARD next to he come in William conqueror and after he his son William Rufus but this royal tree take root again when Henry the first unto who all regal dignity be transport neither by force compel nor urge with hope of gain but mere take with a affection of love take to wife Mawde dauphin to s. Edward niece join and unite together by this marriage the blood royal of the norman and the english both in one then this tree do true flourish when of this unite royalty Mawde the empress be beget and then it bring forth fruit when by she we have Henry the second who like unto a corner stone unite both nation together and therefore by this we now see that England have a english king as allsoe bishop abbot prince and knight of the same ancient race derive from this union of both nation but if any man be displease with this exposition let he either expound it better or expect a other time until he find these particularity fulfil 26 but let we return to our b. king who sickness still increase make he evident feel and understand by the secret s. Edward death ambassador of near approach death that his hour be come to pass out of this world and therefore cause his death to be publish abroad before hand lest the knowledge thereof be delay he shall want the comfort of the prayer and sacrifice of his clergy and people which he earnest desire this do the holy man load with many day of old age and as many good work as hour in each day he yield up his pure soul into the most pure hand of his redeemer by who death England whole felicity liberty and strength be utter lose broken and overthrow no soon be the breath go out of his holy body but his face cast forth beam of wonderful brightness make death in he seem beautiful and lovely to the behoulder this glorious king and worthy benefactor of s. benedict order die the five of january one thousand sixty six the beauty of his dead body when he have reign twenty three year six month and twenty seven da^es he be honourable bury in s.

receive at his consecration many year before his death will not hang on his finger for his flesh be so consume by his extreme penance and austerity of life that his body be nothing but skin and bone but although his ring often time fall from his finger thus a notable miracle consume yet be it never lose and he do often say that he will carry with he to his grave that ring which without ambition

principle of the true religion which be not can be but one only this life be write in latin by P^ul^s Dia^^n^^ a benedictin monk above 850. year ago and for the antiquitle we have make choice of it rather than any other i. gregory bear in Rome son to gordian and Silvia descend his birth and parent from a noble race of roman senator in who nobility be adorn with religion and religion ennoble with virtue for Felix chief pastor of the same sea Apostolicque be father unto his great grandfather and a man of great virtue and integrity and in his time the glory of Christ church but yet gregory in his pious conversation and manner be a ornament to the great nobility of his birth in fine as clear afterward it appear it be not without some great presage that this name be allot he for gregorin in greek signify as much as vigilant or watchful in English his name expound and in very deed he be watchful over himself whilst exact adhere to the commandment of God he lead a virtuous and laudable life here on earth he be vigilant over the faithful people of God church when by the force of his fluent doctrine he make plain unto they the straight way to heaven from a child he be so well instruct in the liberal science that albeit at that time the study of learning flourish much in Rome yet he be judge second to none in the whole city in his age which as yet be but little and unripe there be a mind full of mature study and manlike endeavour to wit to stick to the saying of his ancient and when he hear thing worthy of notice he will not by neglect commit it to oblivion but rather commend it to the strong hold of his memory so that then with a thirsty breast he suck up strea of learning which afterward with a mellifluous voice he may utter in due season 2 in the very time of his youth when that age be wont to enter the conversation of his youth into the dangerous path of the world he begin to settle himself in devotion towards God and with all the desire of his heart to aspire to the country of everlasting life but while he deffer the grace of his conversion somewhat long and think best after he be inspire with that heavenly desire to hide it under his secular apparel and to serve the world as it be in outward show so many difficulty out of that little care of the world arise against he that now he be not detain therein only in outward show but almost in mind too as he himself affirm till as length the death he build many monastery of his parent give he free scope to dispose of himself and his affair he make that open know which before lay hide under the secrecy of his mind and that which before be only in the sight of he that see all thing he manifest now to the public view of the world for distribute all his temporal good in pious work to the end that in the state of povertic he may follow CHRIST who for our sake become poor he build six monastery in Sicily and furnish they with virtuous monk to sing the praise of almighty God the seven he erect within the wall of Rome in which afterward have gather together a great convent of monk and forsakesn the pomp of the world he himself live in regular discipline under the command and obedience of a abbot unto these monastery he allot so much yearly rend out of his own mean as may suffice each one for necessary maintenance all the rest of his temporal good house and land he shall and deal the money to the poor turn hereby by a divine inspiration all that glory and nobility which he seem to have in the world to purchase the happiness of the ever-florishing city of heaven and he that before be wont to wall through the city of Rome clothe in silk and load with glitter gem afterward cover with a poor simple weed become a poor servant to the poor 3 for have change his secular apparel he go to the he take the habit of a benedictin monk monastery and make a naked escape out of the shipwreck of the world there he begin to live in so great grace of perfection that even then in his very beginning he may be reckon in the number of the perfect so that within a while be choose by the common consent of the convent he refuse not to undertake the charge of abbott to be short he be so abstinent in his diet so vigilant in his prayer and so untired in his labour of fast that out of over much weakness in his stomach he be scarce able to subsist he sustain beside a continual sickness of body and chief he be grieve with the trouble of that disease which the phistian call in greek the cruelty whereof so torment his vital part that be take with frequent and sudden agony he seem every moment to be ready to yield up the ghost but what manner of man he be in his monastery and with how commendable a exercise he lead his life we may gather out of his own word which with weep tear he utter when he be pope his speech to Peter deacon to Peter his deacon say my wretched mind be strike with the wound of its own present necessary employment remember in what state it be in the monastery how all sleet thing than see the happiness of a religious life be subject unto it how eminent it be above thing that be toss in the world that it be accoustume to think on nothing but heavenly matter that be yet detain within this body in contemplation it surpass that inortall prison itself yea and that which be a punishment almost to all man it be in love even with death itself as be the entrance to life and the reward of labour but now by reason of this heavy pastoral charge it suffer in the affair of secular man and after so swcet a form of its own quietness it be defile with the dust of worldly business I consider therefore what i do endure i consider what i have lose and when i behold that which i have lose the burden which I undergo grow more grievous for now behold toss in the wave of a huge sea and in the ship of my mind I be dash and beat with the storm of a mighty tempest and while i call to my remembrance the tranquillity of my former life castle back my eye to what be past i sigh at the sight of the desire shore and which be yet more irksome whilst I be discontent toss in these huge wave I have scarce the happiness to see the haven which I leave thus he be wont to relate of himself not brag of his proficiency in virtue but rather bewail his deficiency which he ever fear to run into through his pastoral charge but albeit he speak in this manner of himself out of a mind full of profound humility it become we notwithstanding to believe that by reason of his pastoral dignity he lose nothing of his monastical perfection yea rather that he receive thereby a great advancement in perfection by his labour in the conversion of many than he have in time pass in the tranquillity of his own private contemplation 4 but by what mean this bless man be raise first to the office of deacon and after to the high dignity of chief bishop the ensue speech shall declare the roman bishop who then govern the church preceave Gregory to climb up by the degree of virtue he be make deacon and the Pope Legate to the height of perfection have call he out of his belove monastery herayse the office and dignity of ecclesiastical order make he the seven Levite or deacon for his assistance and not long after direct he as his legate or commissary to the city of Constantinople for answer touch affair of the Catholicque church nether yet do gregory albeit he be conversant in a worldly palace intermitt the purpose of his heavenly manner of life for the divine providence so ordain for his great good that diverse of the monk out of a obligation of fraternal love follow he from the monastery to the end that by their example as a ship with anchor he may be stay at the please shore of prayer and contemplation and that while he be toss with the continual blow of secular affair he may fly to their company as to the bosone of a most sure haven after the volume and wave of his worldly employment and allthought that office with the sword of his extern labour now be abstract from his monastery despoil he of his former tranquillity of life notwithstanding among they the aspiration of his daily remorse through the discourse of their earnest read do give he new courage of life therefore by the company of these he be not only fence from worldly assault but allsoe enkindle more and more to the exercise of a heavenly life then at the earnest request of those his brethren and chief of that venerable man LEANDER archbishop he writ moral upon job. of Seville who at that time be come legate to Constantinople in the cause of the visigothe he be compel to explicate the book of holy job so intricate in mystery nether have he the power to deny a work which at the request of charity brotherly love do impose upon he for the profit of many but in a course of thirty five book he thorough instruct we how the same book of job be to be understand literal how to be apply to the hide mystery of CHRIST and his church and in what sense it may be fit to every christian in particular in which work of he he discourse after such a admirable manner of virtue and vice that he seem not only to express those thing in naked word only but after a manner to demonstrate they in visible form wherefore there be no doubt but he have true attain to the perfection of the virtue themselves who effect with so much efficacy he be able to declare v whilst yet he remain in the same royal city of Constantinople he overthrow the heresy of Eutichius by the assistant grace of the Catholic truth he overthrow a new bud heresy of the state of resurrection in the very first appearance and beginning of it for indeed Eutichius bishop of the same city hold a opinion that our body in the glory of the late resurrection shall be impalpable and more subtle than either the wind or air which s. Gregory understanding he prove both by force of reason and truth and the example of our lord resurrection that this assertion be whole opposite to the doctrine of the Catholicque faith which hold that this our very body raise in the glory of the resurrection shall indeed not only be subtle by reason of its spiritual power but palpable allsoe to show the truth of the nature according to the example of our lord body of which raise from death himself say to his disciple Luc 24. v. 39 feel and see for a spirit have not flesh and bone as you see i have for the assertion of this the venerable father of our faith gregory fight with so great pain against this breed heresy and with so great instance have allsoe the help hand of the most pious emperor Tiberius Constantine he utter break in piece that opinion that no man yet be ever find that offer to revive it 5 than within a short time after the venerable Levite or deacon gregory be return back to Rome the river Tiber swell over his bank with so great a inundation and grow so powerful that his rage water flow over the wall of the city and take violent possession of many street therein in so much that it overwhelm many monument of ancient building and with the outrage of this flood the barn of the church be overturn in which many thousand bushel of wheat be lose then a multitude of serpent with a monstrous dragon float down the gulf of this river like unto a mighty beam of timber into the sea and many beast be drown and cast on shore by the briny wave of the trouble water present hereuppon follow a pestilent disease of which first die pope Pelagius according pope Pelagius die ^^^ch c 9 v. 6. to that a begin from my sanctuary and then there fall so great a destruction of the common people that in many part of the city house be leave without any inhabitant but because the church of God can not be without a ruler all the people make choice of bless Gregory who by all mean possible Gregory be choose pope resist against it and endeavour more wary to avoid the height of that dignity he often proclaim himself unworthy of such honour fear indeed lest the glory of the world which he have cast off before may by some mean steal upon he again under the colour of ecclesiastical government whence it come to pass that he direct a epistle to mauritius the emperor unto who son he be godfather entreat and conjure he with many prayer never to grant consent to the people to advance he to the grace of so great a dignity but the perfect of the city call german intercept his messenger and havig apprehend he and tear his epistle he direct the election and consent of the people to the emperor who give God thanks for the friendship of the deacon because according to his desire he have find a occasion to bestow a honour upon he forthwith give a command for his instalment 7 and the time of his consecration be at hand when that pestilent disease still make great havoc among the people he his speech to the people begin to exhort they to do work of peanance in this sort it behoove most belove brethren at least that we fear the scourge of God now come and make present among we by experience which we ought to have fear come let grief open we the gate of our conversion and let that very punishment which we feel dissolve the hardness of our heart for as by the testimony of the prophet it be foretell jer. c. 4. v. 10. the sword be come even to the soul behold all the people be smite with the sharp point of heaven wrath and all be destroy with sudden and unexpected ruin nether do sickness prevent death but death itself as you see prevent the delay of sickness every one that be strike be sudden take away before he can be convert to tear of peanance consider therefore brethren what manner of man he appear before the fight of the dreadful judge who have no leisure to bewail what he have do whole family tumble into destruction together their house be leave empty parent see the burial of their child and their heir go before they to the grave let we all therefore fly to tear of peanance for refuge while we have leisure to weep before the blow of ruin fall upon we let we call to mind whatsoever through error and negligence we have commit and chastise our default with sorrow and repenrance let we go before his face in confession and as psalm 94. five 1. the royal prophet admonish let we lift up our heart and hand to our lord for to lift up our hair with our hand be to raise and stir up the endeavour of our prayer with the merit of good work he give in very deed he give great confidence to our fear who cry out by the prophet I will not the death of a sinner but Ezech. c. 33. v. 11. that he be convert and live let no man then despair out of the immensity of his sin for the inveterate fault of the be wash away with three day peanance and the convert thief purchase the reward of life e^en at the very sentence of his death let we therefore change our heart and presume that we have obtain what we ask the judge will soon incline to our prayer if our mind be recall from their wichednes the sword then of so severe a punishment hang over our head let we earnest labour with importune lamentation for that importunity which to man be wont to be grateful be please to the judge of truth because our pious and merciful lord who will not be angry according as we deserve will have thing exact from he by prayer hence he tell we by the psalmist call upon 49. v. 16. i in the day of thy tribulation and I will deliver thou and thou shall magnify i he himself therefore be a witness for himself that he desire to have mercy on such as call upon he and exhort we to call upon he for this cause most dear brethren have our heart contrite and our work amend from wendsday morning next let we come in a devout manner with tear to the litany for seven day space that when the severe judge mean to punish we and our offence he may mitigate the sentence of damnation and spare we we think fit to set down here this exhortation of s. gregory that we may show on how great height of perfection he lay the foundation of his preach therefore when a great multitude of priest monk and other of all age sex and condition be gather together at the day appoint according to the holy man command to call to God for mercy the sickness wax so cruel and outrageous among they that within the space of own hour whilst the people make their supplication to our lord fourscore person fall to the ground and die but the holy priest cease not therefore to preach to the people and that they will not cease from their prayer until through the mercy of almighty God the pestilence itself cease Gregory (@) to (@) the popedom 8 and be afterward to be raise to the episcopal dignity when as he do yet seek mean to conceal himself by flight for the prevent of his desire watch and ward be appoint at all the gate of the city until as so sacred a order require all the divine rite and ceremony may due and glorious be accomplish towards he but he find mean to be secret he be miraculous betray by a pillar of fire convey out of town by the help of certain merchant and so hide himself in uncouth place for the space of three day until the people of Rome with fast and prayer obtain the discovery of that lose treasure by a bright pillar of fire send from above which glitter a good part of the night in a direct line from the heaven over his head reveal their wish desire to those that seek he and at the same time there appear to a certain anachorite live near the city angel descend and ascend by the same fiery pillar upon he hence the anachoret take a sacred and happy signification of that ladder which holy jacob see in his sleep cry out that there be the house of our lord and that he shall be the ruler of God house which be the church yea the temple of God say he lie hide there at length the elect and belove servant of God be find apprehend and bring to the church of bless PETER the apostle where he be consecrate in the office of episcopal authority and make pope of Rome 9 at this time be reprehend by John bishop of Ravenna that he so fit a man by conceal himself will seek to his writing avoid that pastoral charge he take this occasion to write that excellent book call the pastoral care wherein he make it manifest appear what manner of man ought to be choose for the government of the church how the ruler themselves shall govern their own life with what discretion they be to instruct their subject of all kind and with how great consideration they be bind daily to reflect upon their own frailty he write allsoe the four book of dialogue at the request of Peter his Decon in which for a example to posterity he collect the virtue of the saint of Italy which he either know or can hear to be the most famous and as in the book of his homily and exposition he teach what virtue be to be practise so in his writing of the saint and their miracle he will demonstrate how great the excellency of the same virtue be allsoe in twenty and two homily he expound the first and last part of the prophet Ezechiel which seem to contain great obscurity and declare how great light lie hide therein moreover he write upon the proverb and the canticle of the prophet of the book of king of the book of Moses and many other with very many epistle which for brevity sake I omit to cite in particular and that which most of all I wonder at be that he can compile so many and so great volume when almost all the time of his his many affliction with sickness youth that I may use his own phrase he be torment with such cruel gripe and pain of his entrails that every hour and moment the virtue and strength of his stomach be overthrow the faint he gasp allsoe with the pain of fever which albeit they be but slack yet be they continual and oftentimes he be vehement torment with the gout x. but in the mean time while he careful consider that as the scripture witness every child that be receive in scourge by how much the more he be more rude depress with present evil so much the sure he presume of his eternal reward moreover he be tire with a continual care in ordain a watch his great care of the church over the city to guard it from enemy allsoe he bear a mind full of fear daily by reason of the danger he often hear his ghostly child and subject be in but be beset on all side with such and so many encumbrance yet he be never idle or at rest but either do somewhat for the increase and furtherance of his subject and spiritual child or write something worthy the church or else labour by the grace of divine contemplation to make himself familiar with the secret of heaven in sum when very many almost out of all part of Italy fear the sword of the longobard flock on all side to the city of Rome he his great piety and charity most diligent care for they all and feed their soul with his divine sermon he provide they allsoe with sufficient succour and nourishment for the body for his soul be so conquer with the love of pity that he do not only give comfort and succour to those that be present with he but to such as live far off he will likewise impart the pious work of his bounty in so much that he send help to some servant of God that live in the mount Sinai for indeed other bishop bend their endeavour chief in building and adorn church with gold and silver but this albeit he be not want herein yet do he in a manner omit those good work that he may whole and entire apply himself to the gain of soul and what soever money he can get he be careful to distribute and give it to the poor that his righteousness psal 3. v. 8 Job 29. 13. may remain ever and his authority be exalt in glory so that he may true say that of holy job the benediction of one in distress come upon i and I comsort the heart of the widow I be clothe with justice and I have clothe myself with my own judgement as with a garment and a diadem i be a eye to the blind and a foot to the lame i be a father of the poor and most diligent i search out a cause which i know not and a little after see if I have eat my morsel of bread alone and the orphan have not ibid. c. 31. 18. eat of it b^cause from my infancy pity grow together with i and come with i out of my mother womb 11 on and not the least of his work of piety and zeal be the deliver of the english nation by his preacher thither send out of the servitude of the ancient enemy to be make participant of the everlasting freedom for whosoever faithful adher unto our lord shall of his bountiful reward have advancement daily to high matter therefore while this holy man labour with ardent desire to gather together by parcel a harvest of faithful soul our pious lord give he the great grace to convert the whole nation of the English of which conversion perform without question by the special providence of almighty God this be the occasion as upon a time some merchant come to Rome with diverse kind of merchandise to be sell and that many people flock to the market place some to buy other to see it happen that gregory before he he find englishman to be foul in Rome be adorn with the papal dignity come among the rest and see among other thing child of very dainty white body fair complexion and lovely hair expose to sale who as he behold he demand as it be report out of what country or land they be bring and it be tell he they come from the island of Britain the inhabitant whereof shine all with the like beauty again he ask whether they be christian in that island or entangle in the error of paganism that they be pagan it be answer then fetch a deep sigh from the bottom of his heart o lamentable case say he that man of so bright face shall be in the possession of the author of darkness and that so sweet a comeliness of countenance shall bear mind void of inward joy again therefore he demand what be the name of that nation it be reply that they be call angle right they be term so say he for they have angelical face and it be fit that such be make coheire with the angel in heaven out of what province pursue he be these bring hither it be resolve he that they be call DEIRI with good reason say he for thy be to be deliver from ire and wrath to be call to the mercy of christ-iesus but the king of that province how be he call addelle reply they and allude to that name he say that to the praise of almighty God ALLELVIA shall be sing in those part and go to the bishop of the roman apostolic his zealous desire to convert the english sea he earnest request he to send some preacher of the gospel into Britain to convert the english nation to to Christ church affirm himself to be most ready by the help of God to undertake that sacred work if so it may stand with the good like of the Apostolicque Sea to which request the pope at first deny his consent till at length overcome and weary with his unwearied entreaty he yield against his will but he conceal the business of his go from the citizen who have they know will never have consent he begin his journey towards England thereunto with as speed as he can have receive the apostolical benediction begin his journey in the mean time the news be blow into the ear of the roman who all with one mind and voice as well the citizen as those of the suburb meet with pope Pelagius as he be go to saint Peter church all cry out with a terrible noise and repeat these word alas apostolical man what have thou do thou have offend saint PETER overthrow Rome thou not only have dismiss but expel Gregory the pope be move herewith for he fear the people send letter to recall Gregory out of his journey but before the messenger have overtake he he be get three day journey on his way in the mean time as the manner be with traveller about the six hour some of his companion take their rest in a fair meadow or be busy other way whilst he read to those that sit by his side when a locust come leap about he and light on his book sit upon the very page he read Gregory perceave she sit so quiet there turn to his fellow Locusta say he may be etimologise with loco-sta that be stand in the place and you must know that we may not proceed any further in our intend journey rise notwithstanding and prepare our horse that as long he be call back by the pope as it be lawful we may hold on our way and whilst they discourse thus together the pope messenger come sudden upon they with their horse sweat out of haste and deliver their letter which be read it be even so say he to his fellow as unhappy I foretell for we must present return to Rome and so they do but as as soon as he be invest in the papal dignity he accomplish this long desire work and send other preacher he himself that their preach may take good effect fortify their mission with his pious exhortation prayer and reward in sum he send into the same island the servant of God Austin mellitus and JOHN with many other monk that fear England convert by s. Augustine a Benedictine monk God who in a short space convert the chief king that inhabit the head of the same island together with all his people and herein God grant they so great grace in do of wonder that they confirm the doctrine of faith which they preach with their mouth with the force and efficacy of strange sign and miracle whence it come to pass that within a few year the other king of the same island with their whole number of subject receive the christian faith of who deed conversion and the wonderful miracle do therein saint Gregory speak thus in the book of his moral behold the Britain tongue that heretosore know nothing else but rude accent of barbarism begin now late to warble forth the divine praise in the Hebrew language behold the ocean in time past swell with rage become obedient and calm under the foot of the saint and they who barbarous valour the prince of the world can not subdue with the sword be by the fear of God calm with the simple word of his priest and who sear not whole troop of arm infidel and fierce soldier do now tremble be faithful at the least word of humble man for have understand the divine tiding of the gospel make manifest with many miracle the virtue of heavenly knowledge be infuse into they that bridle with the terror of his divine majesty they be afraid to do ill desire with all their heart by doce well to attain to the grace of everlasting life all which that it may be bring to pass almighty God grant it unto s. Gregory in such sort that deserve the english people ought to call he their apostle for although to other he be not a apostle yet to they he be for they be the seal of his apostleship in our Lord 12 but now to ask whether this man of so great merit have be likewise famous in do of miracle be a superfluous question since it be as clear as the day that he by his own merit be able to show sign of virtue who can through the bounty of CHRIST obtain the like for other if occasion have require but for the better satisfaction of those allsoe who together with the jew require visible sign to show sainctity and for the great edification of those that by the example of saint seek to stir up and advance themselves to high degree of virtue I be determine to set down some few miracle which our lord wrought at his intercession thereby to rouse up the slothful dullness of our mind and strengthen the feebleness of our heart incline rather to want of belief than ignorance of what we rehearse 13 a noble woman in the city of Rome out of her good affection to devotion and religion be wont to make offer bread for the altar and every sunday to bring they to the church and deliver they to the holy pope himself presume on her custom and familiarity in so do one day it happen that when she come as the manner be to receive at the hand of the bless pope and he offer to give she the sacred eucharist say Jesu etc. she smile and that so broadely that the holy man perceave refuse to give she the communion but turn again to the altar lay that sacred particle by itself commend it to the deacon to be reserve until the rest of the people have communicate and the sacred mystery of mass be end b. Gregory demand of the woman what be in her mind which move she to laugh be about so dreadful a work I perceive say she that particle to be of the same bread which I make with my own hand and offer unto thou and understand it to be call the the body of our lord I can not but laugh then the holy bishop make a speech to the people hereuppon earnest exhort they to make humble prayer unto our lord that for the strengthen of the faith of many he will make that visible to corporal eye which the misbeleef of this woman aught to have behold with the spiritual eye of the soul and the light of faith and prayer to this effect be public make the holy man together with the people and the woman arise and return to the altar in the public view of the people that press on to behold that heavenly spectacle he discover the pall or corporal where he find the sacred host turn the sacrament appear in true form of flesh into the form of flesh and part of his little finger which touch it stain with fresh blood in the mean time the whole multitude of people and the foresay woman herself look on then turn to the woman learn now say he at least to believe the truth bear witness for itself the bread which i joan. 6. proof of the real presence give be my flesh and my blood be true drink but the foresee creator of our weakness by the same power by which he create all thing of nothing form unto himself the holy ghost concur thereunto a body out of the flesh of the ever-virgin Marie and by the sanctification of the same holy spirit and virtue of the Catholicque prayer he daily convert bread into his body and wine mingle with water into his blood for the reparation of our infirmity this say he command the whole company to beseech the divine power to reform that sacred mystery into its former shape whereby it may be make communicable for that woman which be present do and she afterward increase in strength to her faith and religion be consecrate in the participation of that bless sacrament and all that behold this miracle grow more fervent in the love of almighty God and more fortify in the Chatholicque belief 14 allsoe a man noble by birth and as powerful in authority according to the manner of his royal magnificence have by many between-messenger obtain the familiarity of the Apostolicque a nobleman send to he for relic sea and be sufficient instruct in the worship of God and his saint by the frequent admonishment of s.

but the prince of the dane desire to hide the wickedness of their own fact and darken the lustre of the martyr glory decree to drown he go to heaven a martyr his dead body in the river suppose thereby that the foulness of their crime will so much the more easy be keep close by how much the more the memory of the saint be blot out of the mind of the people but what the dane intend for his reproach CHRIST turn to his glory for all that multitude of people which by his preach have renounce their error stand up in arm for his defence choose rather to accompany he in death then to suffer his dead body by who mean while it live they have receive the ablution of life to be bury in the unsatiable a controsie about his body gulf of the water therefore that sacred relic be a cause of controversy between two people of disagee opinion remain unbury and undrowned but the consellour of both party meet in the evening with the force of reason to decide the cause of that contention it be conclude by common consent of both side joint to make intercession to the saint himself that if he be of any power or estimation before the face of almighty God he will show the strength of his authority in the decision of this doubtful question behold say the impious dane a bough cut from its nourish stock deprive both of bark and moisture if this imbrue in ELPHEGUS his blood shall appear the next morning flourish in the green weed of summer it shall be grant that we have put to death a just and holy man and you shall have power to bury he with as much honour as you please but if this will remain dry and wither as now it be it shall be lawful for we to say that you have be blind in your affection towards he and it shall be in our power to dispose of his body as we think best 14 the condition be willing accept on both side to a notable miracle the end it may manifest appear to the world that s. elphegus his death be not a death but a beginning of a better life that wither branch in the space of one night begin to flourish and wax green and albeit it be plant in the ground but the evening before yet it be find adorn with the green livery of spring the next morning whereupon their obstinate mind beginning to relent they strive to prevent one and other with embrace and kiss the dead body humble bow down their stubborn neck and bathe his deaths-wound with the flood of their repentant tear therefore his body be lift on the shoulder of his enemy be carry in triumph to the new bear tree as to the flourish trophy of his glory accompany in the way with almost innumerable miracle send from heaven as testimony of his cause and goodness for the sick receive their health the blind their sight the deaf their hear the dumb their speech and the many miracle lame the perfect use of their limb

of revengeful punishment against the author of his death that one of the captain be the bloody cause of his one death a other cut his own throat to avoid further inconvenience a priest that hide the holy martyr cross be cross out of this life with the sword and one of the same function that presume to wear the holy saint pantafle be before all the people cruel torment by the devil and so horrible a terror seize on all the davish prince that not dare to trust themselves on the foot of the land they will needs adventure their line at sea immagen there to escape the holy martyr anger who the earth can not keep in safety from it but they find the sea a far more implacable element to suffer such impiety for they be no soon launch into the deep but the bluster wind raise such tumult in those

Canutus king of the dane come turkill worthy punish with a great navy into England where fall out with turkill for some wicked and perfidious action of he he destroy the whole remnant of his impious

country till at length be murder by the base common people his soul be send to the reward of her impiety and his body throw into the open field to be bury in the gut of raven and wild beast but after this Canutus perceive his people to be continual slay by the english army and find that the neighbourhood of necessity compel he to think of yield he consult with some of the wise Englishmen that have flee to he for refuge to know what may be the cause of those many mischance that have befall he they all with one voice say that it be according to the prophecy of the holy martyr s. ELPHEGUS who in his affliction by the dane his predecessor foretell that they shall take no sure root in the kingdom of England but shall perish by a worse death than Sodom now therefore say they if thou desire to pacify that holy saint during the time of thy reign promise he that thy affair succeed well thou will cause his sacred relic to be honourable transport to his own archiepiscopal seat of Canturbury and bury Can^tus promise to trauslate his body to Canturbury there amo^gst his predecessor which promise faithful make by have within a while obtain peace and after peace the own half of the kingdom and after the half the whole be as faithful perform for ten year after the holy martyr death Canutus send for Egelnoth archbishop of Canturbury who come to London go direct to the cathedral church of s. Paul where the king present give he the meeting and declare that the cause why he send for he be to make use of his authority and counsel in the translation of s. elphegus his body to Canturbury 16 the archbishop much amaze at the breath of this proposition answer that sure his majesty have not take mature deliberation and consider sufficient the reason and ground of adventure on so great a enterprise and moreover that for his part he fear lest he will be tear in piece by the londoner who will rather loose their life then be deprive of so great a treasure and patron and you see say he further that we have here only ourselves and two monk and the stone that cover his monument be of that weight and bigness that some yoke of ox be scarce able to move it but the king arm with the shield of a most invincible faith answer that god and the holy martyr assistance if that translation be please unto they will not be want in a time of such necessity therefore the labour be commit to those two monk one of they be call alsward in time pass of familiar acquaintance a strange m^racle with s.

Auselme ask the habit of a monk be deny habit of a abbot of that country who fear his father displeasure that be ignorant of anselm intention herein refuse to grant his request but Anselme constant in his holy purpose make his prayer to almighty God to send he some corporal sickness that so at lest he may become a monk and a patient in religion to cure the disease or rather conserve the innocence of his soul his prayer be hear and his request grant when languish in his desire sickness he send to the abbot with many earnest entreaty to be admit into his order for that now he fear death be at hand but he upon the same humane respect as before again deny his petition 2 afterward his health return again worldly pleasure and prosperity so sweer smile upon he now in the flower of his youth that the fervour of his former purpose and desire begin by little a little to grow cold especial after the death of his good mother who he high love and respect and he take again to himself free scope to follow the inclination and desire of his sensual not only forget the spirit of his first vocation but allsoe omit his study in science which before he have so careful his father anger against he follow but while thus he hunt in the train of his own passion it please almighty God to look upon he with the eye of a merciful clemency and permit his father to enter into such a extreme dislike of he that he can not afford he as much as a good look hate and disdain in his son as well the good as the evil when on the other side nether his filial humility or duty be of power to appease or any way satisfy his angry father whereupon he choose rather to renounce all his worldly inheritance then to endure the storm of such fury fear to run the hazard of further inconvenience therefore judge his friend and domesticque to be his great enemy he forsake his father house to seek his content and repose elsewhere he depart with one only companion and partly in France partly in Burgundy he spend the space of three year but the worthy fame of lanfrank piety and learning come to his ear he range himself into the list of many other young man of his virtuous school in the benedictin abbey of he become schol ler to Lanfrank bec in Normandy when it be rare to see how Anselme be not so joyful to be a scholar of so excellent a master as Lanfrank be glad to be a master to so worthy a scholar the master care and labour in teach be reward in the scholar with a extraordinary diligence of learning what he teach in so much that in a short time he not only make a great progress into the knowledge of holy scripture and other good doctrine but allsoe exercise himself in watch and prayer and other act of devotion he become very desirous to attain to the height of virtuous perfection for the familiar conversation he use with his good and virtuous master s. LANFRANK cause the light of his ancient resolution towards a monastical life again like a fair morning of piety to break out through the cloud of worldly vanity whole to dedicate himself to God service true it be that he be much perplex with difficulty to attain the end he aim at on the one side he find himself great incline to lead a solitary life in the desert thereby to apply and employ his thought more secure in divine contemplation on the other side he think it a more secure way to live under the rod of obedience in a monastery again his father have leave he heir of great land and good he be in doubt whether he may not do God great service live in the world and yearly distribute the best part of his mean to the poor and pious use in these perplexity this prudent young man will not of himself resolve any thing in a matter of so great moment but consult his master LANFRANK sincere lay open the secret thought of his heart full he consult lanfrank of choose a course of life resign his will into his hand with intention to follow the of his good counsel the master be unwilling to resolve his scholar in a matter of such importance but refer it to the judgement of the venerable prelate Maurill archbishop of Roan unto who they go both and propose their difficulty who have hear the cause counsel Anselme to embrace a religious and monastical life as the most perfect and assure way to heaven and follow this advice he resolve to humble his neck under the sweet yoke of CHRIST in the holy order of saint Benedict 3 but there remain yet a other difficulty of choose the place whether he shall take the habit at Clunie or bec at the first he think his labour and learning may be to many profitable at the other he fear it will like a little star before the sun be darken with the bright splendour of LANFRANK and so become of little or no service at all while his thought be toss with these waver opinion he begin to discourse with himself in this sort why Anselme what do thou mean what do thou think on do thou intend to make a monastical life the first step to obtain fame glory renown and superiority God forbid for the true scope of a monk must be to humble himself to other and he take the habit of s Benedict utter to despise all title of honour and dignity and this thou will attain to at the abbey of bec or no where therefore without all delay he go thither and put on the habit of s. benedict order in the say monastery where the venerable man Hurluin be abbot who out of his own mean and patrimony have first build and found that abbey Anselme be then at the age of 27. year when he become so careful and attentive to imitate the virtue of his other brethren that at the term of three year he become himself to be a bright mirror of religious perfection and monastical discipline to the whole convent so that B. lanerank be take from the priorship to be make abbot of the monastery of cane Anselme much against his will be create prior in his place which title of he be make prior honour do not only not hinder he in the way to perfection but be rather a mean more free to apply himself thereunto by the continual practice of divine contemplation and heavenly discipline follow with so great fervour that he attain to suchan height of speculation that he discover and maintain with evident reason many question and assertion of the divine nature never hear off before his time lie one night awake in his bed he have many doubtful thought how the prophet do not only see thing present but thing to come allsoe foretell they as distinct as they have be

of wisdom he have such a certain discretion of spirit that he easy pierce the great light of his f^^le the manner and inclination of all that come to he even to the knowledge of their secret thought

efficacy in give of counsel that the very spirit of all good counsel seem as in a throne to rule and reign in his breast his continual exercise in fast watch prayer and other mortification of body to

admirable especial towards those who be less obedient than be requisite among who be some who great envy that he be prefer before they to the priorship and other who do carp and back bite all his saying and do against these and their malice the prudent holy man fight with so great discretion in show they all duty of fraternal charity that with the sweetness of his demeanour he break their stonic heart and with the majesty of his humility and modesty he reclaim they to the level of his own will this sweet and meek spirit which our lord bestow upon he appear more clear in that which pass between he and a young monk call Osberne one of a pierce wit and good ability but a very libertine in his manner of a turbulent and detract spirit and in all thing so contrary to his superior that he disdain to give he a good look when he be admonish to follow the rule of modesty and virtue he run headlong into the ruin of his one osberne i^ateth s. Auselme own soul s. Anselme undertake to cure which he perform with wonderful great art and prudence for perceave his course to be in a desperate violence incline to vice he do not present thunder against he with the terror of sharp word and correction anselm pious craft to reduce he to good but first shine in all love and meekness towards he give scope for a time to the reins of his inordinate passion when OSBERN^ perceive how he enjoy his pleasure under the wing of his allowance begin exceed to love he and whole to put himself into his hand off which desire occasion the holy man take hold he begin with a little more sevetitie to curb his deprave manner to cut off all his boyish action and to admit nothing worthy reprehension in he which be not sharp revenge both with word and stripe whereby it come to pass that he who before be on the brink ready to tumble into a precipice of vice be bring to the firm land of religious and regular observance whereon he keep sure foot to the hour of his death which follow short after during the time of his last sickness s. Anselme wait himself upon he and after his death either say or cause when he can not a mass to be say every day for the health of his soul the space of a whole year and by his mean many other servant of God do the like a good example for all superior to learn how to carry themselves in win and correct the sometime turbulent spirit of their subject how to deal with their sick and last how they ought to pray for those that die under their a good les^o^ for superior charge 5 he show no less charity towards a other monk gray in old age but green in virtue who by the instigation of the devil be grievous incense against the holy prelate so that he can not affoor he a good word or look this poor monk happen to fall sick and come to such extremity that he expect nothing but death he seem to behold two cruel wolf which take he about the neck and endeavour to strangle he whereat he roar and cry out so dreadful that s. Anselme then busy in the cloister run towards the infirmary to know the matter and enter see the virtue of the ^oly cross into the chamber make the sign of the holy cross upon the sick man say and straight he be quiet confess that when Anselme make the sign of the cross he see as it be a fiery lance shoot out of his mouth which fear away those ugly wolf that seek to devour he then be exhort to penance for his sin he confess and be absolve by s. Anselm who allsoe foretell he the hour of his death all that hear and see what pass be great edify with so great charity of the saint and amaze at the wonderful light of his soul the like bounty and goodness shine in he at other time in his great care towards the sick visit comfort rejoice and with his own hand serve they and do the part not only of a true father but allsoe of a most charitable mother among they so that in all their necessity the monk have recourse unto he with as great confidence as the child have in his mother lay open before he all the secret passion and wound of their soul which he like a holy physician because he know the root and of they all easy cure this union of the part of the body with their head and subject with their superior be the nurse and soul of all religion 7 he willing employ himself in bring up young youth of young gentleman bring up in monasteric a middle age judge his pain therein to be so much the more profitable as that age like unto soft wax be apt to receive and conserve all the lineament of virtue imprint therein it be a venerable custom in those time to nourish and bring up gentleman son of the best sort in monastery of s. benedict order either to become religious if they be so addict or by that virtuous education to make they more capable in their ripe year to profit the common wealth a abbott in great reputation of holy life come one day to vistt s. Anselme and discourse with he of the government of monastery begin great to complain of the liberty and disobedience of the young gentleman under his charge and that he watch night and day over they and make their fault to be severe whip and chastise and yet it seem that the more he keep they under the worse and more incorrigible they grow and what say s. Anselme become of these child when their be at age or what profit reap you out of all this whip and scourge gentleness most requisite in bring up youth for the most part reply the abbott they grow to be great ignorant dolt then s. Anselme this manner of education of youth seem to i most uncertain for even as if one who by hedge in of young plant do so choke they up with thorn that they can neither grow nor put forth their bough will consequent bring no fruit nor profit so in the nourishment of child who be rich and delicate plant to bring they to good one must use a fatherly love towards they give they a gentle and discrete liberty and not always make they slave with fear threaten and stripe because when they do not acknowledge and find in their tutor and master that guide they the cordial affection and love of a father they think whatsoever be say or do to they proceed out of chollar hatred and malice and as they grow in age they grow allsoe in a great defiance of their master of who they have as great horror as a thief of his executioner rule for superior in their government in fine s. Anselme teach the abbott that true government ought to know how to temper sweet with sour clemency with severity and to cure wound not only with the sharpness of wine which close up but with the suppleness of oil allsoe which soften and open the sore for although hard bread and crust be good for those that have good tooth yet suck child can eat it and if a superior will guide all his inferior the same way without discern the different condition and inclination of the person who he govern he will certain commit many gross fault to the great affliction and loss of his suiect the fame of s.

receive he very courteous and hold he in great esteem than many of his courtier desire for envy be the ordinary fruit that grow at court. then Dunstan albeit he be conversant in the palace of a terrene king yet do he nothing swerve from his exercise and resolution of true religion and virtue but by how much he preceave himself to walk more dangerous among the occasion of vice by so much he endeavour more strong and careful to keep himself up from fall and know idleness to be swear enemy to the soul he apply he his practical exercise self to diverse honest practical labour the exercise where of may keep he do and the diversity avoid tedious loathe for in the art of writing paint engrave in wood or bone and work in gold silver or iron he so excel that he be a admiration to many

rise in goodness use many crooked back bite mean to diffame his virtue with the black mark of hypocrisy and the better to authorise their calumny they bring in this that happen in the viol affirm it to have be do by art magic what more this wicked rumour increase daily till the king and other of the nobility take hold thereof Dunstan grow odious in their sight therefore he resolve to leave the

Dunstan already great incline to a course he take the habit of s. Benedict of virtue and piety to forsake the state of marriage which he intend and whole to dedicate himself to a ecclesiastical course therefore without delay he go to the famous Benedicti^ abbey of Glastenbury where he bid adieu to the world and put on the holy habit of saint Benedict and afterward in due time by the hand of the same bishop his cousin he he live in a mo^^ narrow cell be promote to the sacred dignity of priesthood near unto the church of our lady of Glastenbury he build himself a little cell so straight that all that see it be astonish how a live man can dwell in it for I myself say the author of his life have measure the place contain but four foot in length and two and a half in breadth the height be proportionable to the ordinary stature of a man in the midst of the door be a little window in this slender lodging he lead his life in prayer and contemplation work in such thing as the narrowne of the place will permit but above all thing labour to please almighty God in all and through all his action he braue' vanquish the de vill daily gain to himself a high place in his divine favour but the devil envy his pious exercise endeavour to disturb his devotion present himself one day unto he in the form of a maid that feign to be in want of his help about some piece of work and as the holy man prepare himself to satisfy her demand he perceive that enemy of mankind to transform himself into diverse shape that he seem to see the form and hear the voice now of a old man now of a young man and straight of some lascivious woman that stand before he then understanding what it be he catch the fiery tongue out of the fire and take that hellish monster by the nose and hold he fast there then be to be see a brave combat between the friend and enemy of almighty God till at length saint Dunstan remain conqueror the devil flee away with confusion horrible roar and complain that his pride and cavie have receive the foil and never after adventure to molest the holy man in that place when from this time Dunstan be endue with so great purity of heart and his rare purity of mind and body such a rare chastity of body that he more ressemble a angel of heaven than a mortal man whence it come that many poor and rich flock unto he from all part to use his counsel for the health of their soul and to be by he inform and direct in the way of good life and virtue among other that come to be instruct by his zeal and prudence one be a virtuous matron call elsgine who when he have pious direct and well ground in the way of virtue for a long time and

five monastery build by his mean and with the rest and his own inheritance be the only child of his parent he build and enrich afterward five monastery and fill they with holy conuent of Benedictine monk 7 not long after king Ethelstan be dead Edmond his brother succeed in the kingdom of England who understand of an. 940. the rare prudence sanctity and discretion of saint Dunstan send for he to his court that by his worthy counsel and industry he Dunstan in great favour with king Edmond may the easy rule the sceptre of his kingdom with justice Dunstan offer this service to God and the good of the common wealth condescend to his desire when it be rare to behold how prudent he behave himself in dispose of the affair of the realm in compose of contention that arise and establish true peace and concord among the subject to the great comfort and joy both of the king and noble nevertheless within a while he lose all favour and grace with they both by the envious detraction by enui^he he i. expel the court. of those that can not support the lustre of his resplendent virtue nor endure one alone to bear more sway and be in great credit than all the rest what shall I say the malignant word of his adversary prevail so far that Dunstan be not only deprive of all ancient honour but also banish the court. this do after three day the king go on hunt and be carry by the untamed courage of his horse pursue the game towards a mighty precipice that threaten both he and his beast with destruction see imminent death before he the injury do to Dunstan come sudden into his mind whereat sigh from the bottom of his heart he be much grieve promise straight in his mind that if by God help he escape that danger alive he will again receive he into his favour when to his great comfort and admiration his horse which before no force can hold stop sudde on the ridge of that huge downfall he be recall to savour and deliver he from his expect ruin then have relate this accident to his noble and cause Dunstan to be send for he humble demand pardon for his fault do worthy peanance for the injury and restore he to his ancient honour place and dignity faithful promise to be his true friend and protector ever after moreover as a testimony of his future friendship he give he the land of Glastenbury where he be bear and breed to be dispose according to his good will and like saint Dunstan by the king mean build there a goodly monastery and gather he build the monastery of Glastenbury into it a worthy convent of Benedictine monk who he himself govern in quality of abbot so that by his good example and industry that abbey increase wonderful both in the excellency of monastical profession and in the abundant possession of temporal good and that place become a nursery of learned and holy man that through all England cast the foundation of a religious life under the rule of saint Benedict like so many pillar of the Catholic church and now it come to pass that as in this church as it be about say the whole multitude of people recover light from saint Dunstan mother candle so out of this place thus institute by the learning and industry of Dunstan himself all the church of England receive the light of true religion and monastical discipline by the example and virtue of many worthy man call hence to the dignity of abbot and bishop in the kingdom 8 amid these thing the holy life and conversation of saint Dunstan purchase he wonderful hatred from the devil the perpetual enemy to the Benedictine order but he always find he to be as his name signify a firm rock of the mountain he hearet (@) the song of angle who all the hellish practice of that master of mischief can not move from the ground of virtue and by so worthy triumph over that infernal monster he deserve to to be partaker of the sweet harmony of angelical voice which at the instant when king Edgar son of Edmond be bear he hear sing a Anthime foretell peace to the english church by that happy birth allsoe at the church of Bathe be very serious detain in his prayer he behold the soul of a young monk who he have bring up at Glastenbury carry up by troop of angel into heaven and it be find that that youth the de^ill appear die at the same instant be afterward in his journey to the king who in great haste have send for he he be meet in the way by the devil who very petulant and like a buffoon rejoice and sport himself before he be demand the cause of his mirth he answer that the king Dunstan friend will short die which shall be a cause of great trouble in the kingdom and he hope that the next king will not favour Dunstan nor his adherent but this master of lie can the death of king Edmond as 946. not utter two true tale together for albeit it fall out indeed that king Edmond be slay in his

Cuthbert appear unto he he to go again to Jerusalem to be make partaker of Christ cross and after his return to inhabit the desert of Finckley not far distant from Durrham who admonition without any delay he obey and perform a journey so laborious and painful that true even out of this so great labour and ardour of the way he may just be think to have participate of the cross and passion of JESUS-CHRIST for he use no other meat by the way but barley bread that now be well dry and harden with age his second journey to Jerusalem his drink be only pure water and his clothes and shoe he never either put off or change so that the sole of his shoe be wear and he neglect to mend they certain lump of dirt and gravel grow together stick to the sole of his foot which give he a feel of most grievous pain nether do he desist therefore from his journey nor shorten his daily accustom length thereof his admirable devotion there 4 be come at length to Jerusalem the long desire end of his painful voyage it be wonderful to be speak how great pleasantness and agility of mind and body he find and feel in himself with how great ardour piety and devotion he watch and pray in those holy place with what stream of tear he water the sacred sepulchre and the other sorrowful monument and trophy of our lord bitter passion and our redemption then together with other he enter into the river Jordan which be the first time that he put off his garment since he begin this tedious journey he return barefoot home have there make a religious and solemn vow never more to wear shoe while he live after his return into England he go to a ermitage in the north at a place in time past Streanshall but now more usual call Whiteby famous for the Benedictine monastery of saint Hilda where when he have remain a year and some month he depart to Durrham and there he not only frequent the church for his devotion his desire to learn psalm but allsoe the child school and diligent listen to hear they recite their lesson to their master whereby he learn many psalm hymn and prayer for he be bend with a devout earnestness to learn the psalm by heart and the book of they he always carry about with he hang by a string to his little finger whereby it come to pass that that finger be always bend crooked all his life after but now he be total carry towards his desire solitude and at Durham he earnest implore s. Cuthbert the chief captain and foreman of his undertake that by the help of his intercession and prayer he may fight valiant and fruit full for the health of his soul in the ermitage of Finckley allot for his habitation in which once enter he remain afterward for the space of threescore and three year he live threescore and three year a ermite and never go out but thrice in all that time which be to Durrham three mile distant the first time that he go be on a Christmas night to be present at the divine office and sacrifice of the monk when there fall a incredible abundance of snow which be second with a most sharp and bitter frost so grievous wound the bare foot of the holy man that every step he make leave behind it a bleed witness of his sufferance at a easter again he come once to Durham to receive the dreadful and venerable sacrament of the altar and the last time he come be send for by the bishop v. now if one will as the greatness of the matter require exact set down and describe all the manner of life of this thrice happy saint whilst he live in this desert he may fill whole volume of wonder we it shall ^uffi^e to give the reader some little taste thereof and to gather as it be a short table of his famous deed in sum this I will say that in he there appear in England a second Cuthbert a new HILLARION and a other Anthony will you know what clothing this worthy champion uf true his rude clothing to outward show he wear such that albeit they be his manner of life yet be they not token of so great austerity but under these next unto the bare skin o unspeakable rigour either a most rude shirt of haircloth of which kind he wear out many in that desert or a iron coat of mail of which he allsoe consume three in the space of fifty year or both these rough garment together night and day brace his invincible body will you know with what dainty meat he live very for a time with no other than what the wild and horrid desert afford his hard and spare diet to he live in commons with other beast till after some year he be wont to make his own bread of barley flower mingle with a three part of ash which he will not use until it have be dry and harden for the space of three or four yea sometime six month whereby it lose all gust and savour of bread instead of herb and salad he make himself a kind of strange gruel or pottage of the wild and savage leaf and weed of the desert pound and beat together in water and so boil without either salt or spice which allsoe fear too dainty a feed he will nether taste before it be grow age with hoarne nor make new before the worm and maggot begin to take possession of the old nether do he ever use any other food but this nor any other drink but pure water unless when the extremity of his hunger or thirst be such that it threaten he with the loss of his life sometime he continue his fast for the space of three whole day together and sometime more to this so rare and spare diet his sleep be allsoe correspondent which he do not take in bed but his manner of sleep lie upon the ground or lean his weary limb to a stone or wall never yield to this short and hard allowance of rest until the very necessity of nature by force compel he thereunto after the heavy toil of his day and night-labour^ his continual labour for he labour not only by the sun but by the light of the moon also as well in the parch heat of summer as through the rigid sharpness of winter frost and snow be in the mean time always load with his coat of mail and in these exercise as often as he be not busy in meditation and prayer although indeed at this time he be not idle from both he spend his whole night and day banish from himself thereby all sign of sloth and dullness of mind and body 5 but amid all these labour he severe exact and oblige his daily and nightly prayer himself to certain set hour and time by night and day in which according to the custom of the church he perform his whole and daily task of prayer as at midnight at sunrising at the three six and nine hour and evensong at which time no occasion or hindrance never so great can withdraw he from his devotion and the punctual observance of his time of prayer and divine office which be not that of the church to which his learning will not reach but such psalm as he himself by a divine grace have allot to himself for his devotion and to these time of prayer he call himself and his fellow by the sound of a little bell prepare for that purpose and because over and above this exercise he be wont to add a great number of other prayer at each of they lest he shall omit some through oblivion he lay by a little stone to signify how many be pass and how many be to come give himself also a triple remembrance at the end of each prayer with three blow on the breast the better to incline almighty God to mercy but of all these praise nothing deserve more fame and admiration then that when not only in the summer but allsoe in the cold winter and chief those night in his invincible patience which the water be cruel freeze break the ice he will enter up to the neck into a freeze pond and watch a whole night therein in prayer tear and a self-punishing sufferance all which austerity of cruel winter cold by the force and power of the flame of the divine love that inhabit his soul he easy either contemn or patient and courageous endure and when the vehemency of the cold make his tooth to chatter and beat one and other for heat when all his limb be stark and stiff with that extremity he use these word to himself these suffering be indeed grievous enough but nothing in comparison of hell torment such a generous he endure many disease and unshake mind this brave champion bear in the sufferance of worldly pain of which I know not whether he ever give a more lively example then in the painful disease which it please the goodness of almighty God to send he for the great trial of his patience and more glorious increase of his heavenly crown and reward which divine trial he be so far from take in ill part that contrariwise he most dutiful render thanks unto almighty God as to a most indulgent father who voutchase to chastise his unworthy child and servant with temporal and light punishment and merciful to free he from the eternal pain which he deserve 7 but what he not only endure with a quiet mind these note a rare example of patience grief of proof send from heaven but cause unto himself a new pain no less grievous and painful than the former for when his whole body be cover over with loathsome ulcer and clothe as it be in a horrid scurf of ugly scab which open and separate themselves in many place from the flesh set forth to be see the picture of a most ill-faucured and foul spectacle how gentle and courteous say he our lord deal with i by prevent my eternal torment with such mild and sweet remedy but why be i myself so remiss and so great a sluggard in punish and expiate my own offence and present he cause salt to be bring and pour into those gape and open ulcer and move with a cruel piety he make his servant rub and scour those place with a rope of rude straw in most doleful and pitiful manner in which labour when his servant do sweat with torment and he be not weary with suffer he take the rope himself and with much more pitiless violence he chafe and rub the same vex sore o miraculous example of patience in which and many other virtue his wonderful hum^^^e although he be excellent and great yet he never seem great in my eye than when I consider the humble meek and low mind of the man and so far from all that vain human praise and glory the only plague that many time be wont to defile yea and utter to ruin the famous deed and praise of worthy and renown man but our GODRICK suffer not his praiseworthy deed to come to light and the knowledge of man but endeavour by all mean to suppress they under the veil of humility nay to he it be a grief to come in person to the sight and speech of man whence it be lawful for no man but on certain day in the week and that but with the good leave of the benedictin prior of Durham under who obedience he live to have access unto he the author of his life a man very familiar with he be his confessor desire upon a time that with his good leave he may write his life entreat the holy man to reveal some thing himself touch that matter which to man be unknown see godricks opinion of himself indeed answer he thou have undertake a goodly piece of work for behold here thy wretched GODRICK who in time past be in good state live as a hog of epicure flock a fornicator a usurer a flatterer and a perjure creature but now he be become a base and abject fellow of no reputation a conterfait hermit and a deceiver the false picture of a religious person a idle snort sluggard one that unprofitable consume the pious alm of good man ambitious of honour and unsufferable imperious over his servant with these and other such like title of praise thou may adorn and set forth thy GODRICK to the world which answer so amaze the other that he dare make no further suit unto he in that matter but some year after he give he licence to write have first tie he in the bond of a religious vow that during his life all thing shall be seal up under the lock of silence 8 when the devil the ancient of mankind the devil make wary against he behold these and other such famous virtue to shine in this b. saint they be torment with a new hell of envy against he and use all their deceit tile all their engine and make show of all their terror to entrap he and work destruction either to his soul or body and as in time past saint Cuthbert HILLARION and Anthony and other ancient father so do our GODRICK be assail diverse way by that hellish crew gain at length a glorious victory and triumph over they when first he enter into the ermitage of Finckley a ugly wolf or rather the devil in the shape of a wolf of greatness and fierceness both unusual horrible invade they be vanquish he who by prayer the sign of the cross and a constant and unmoved faith he easy vanquish and put to flight as he afterward do other infinite deceit of those infernal monster and particular when the devil endeavour but in vain to smother he be at his accustom prayer in the cold water who perceave his diabolical wit and force can nothing prevail against he he take his clothes off the bank of the river and run away with they but be recall by saint GODRICK he be force to lay they again in the same place this wicked spirit change himself into a thousand shape to deceive he see the deceit of the devil sometime he put on the form of a ox other time of a bear now of a eagle then of a raven anon of a poor pilgrim and a religious man and at last to omit other of the same kind of a fair woman endeavour to draw he to naughtiness all which with the only form and figure of Christ holy cross and the force of his faith and prayer he easy vanquish sometime a huge troop of infernal spirit provide and arm with fiery sword flame torch club hammer tong and other diabolical weapon with a horrid noise and tumult will rush in to fright he from his devout exercise all which vain mockery of they he will not so much as behold but with his eye shut up contemn they and all their hellish practice which make they depart with shame and sorrow once when the two unresistable companion of mankind he fight with the devil sickness and old age have confine his weak body to entertain they both in his bed for the space of five year together in such sort that he be not able without the help of a servant hand to rise out of his poor couch yet be terrible assail by one of these importune fury of hell he rise without help and naked as he be grapple and fight with that master of mischief from one of the clock till nine and at length put he to flight many year before this time the holy man be wont to sit continual by the fire when behold sudden one of his ancient enemy give he such a mighty blow on the head that he have almost lay he prostrate on the ground which kind of vexation be often use against he but he molest he in nothing more cruel then in stir up many dishonest and tickle motion of lust in his mind and often present himself unto he in the false form of a most beautiful woman which hellish goblin holy GODRICK put to flight with sprinkle the place with holy water 9 and these most cruel assault and skirmish he endure for his great d (...) in overcome unchaste temptatious the space of forty year after his first entrace into the camp of this spiritual combat which unlawful and filthy thought when he can not repress nor overcome neither with watch long then custom pass three and four night together without sleep nor with great fast which he sustain sometime for three or four day sometime for a week undiscontinue nor by the power of his daily prayer he mortify his naked body as we have say in the freeze water up to the neck night and day neither do his rigour stay here but that he may with more ease extinguish those coal of filthy lust which the wicked spirit suggest follow the example of our holy father saint Benedict he ^ambleth naked in the brier he throw himself naked into a thick brake of thorn and brier and tumble up and down therein he miserable rend and tear his flesh rebellious against his mind that by that mean at lest he may oppress all sensual pleasure of the appetite with the feel of a outward pain at length after forty year he get so absolute a victory over this foul tempter and firebrand of dishonesty that either he be not assail at all with any such filthy motion or if he be he easy repress they with the only virtue of his prayer and by the sprinkle of holy water and thus much of the trouble and affliction which the wicked spirit raise against saint GODRICK for it be to long a thing to rehearse they all in particular x. nether ought any one either to wonder that this pious man be afflict with such grievous disease or assail with these horrible deceit and vexation of the wicked spirit since all these thing through his gentle sufferance and patience increase and heap up in his soul new treasure not only of eternal reward and glory to come but also of divine consolation virtue and many heavenly gift and grace in this his temporal and transitory with which the divine goodness so admirable ennoble he that he may sing that verse of the royal prophet a^^^raing to the multitude of my grief thy consolation have rejoice my the wild beast and serpent obey he soul moreover GODRICK obtain command and obedience not only over be wild beast of the desert but allsoe a great multitude of serpent that without any harm frequent his company obey his desire and these be not only to he unhurtful but fawn in a manner upon he remain with he in his cell not without his consent but lest their familiarity and aspect shall hinder and distract the intention of his mind fix in the meditation of heavenly thing he command all these viper and serpent to depart and no more to frequent his lodging to which his command as the wild beast at other time have oftentimes do so now the serpent most exact obey 11 furthermore he be endow with such a rare gift of his rare gift of prophecy prophecy that with the spiritual eye and light of his clear soul he see thng that be absent and distant in remote place as plain and distinct as if they have be within the reach and sphere of his corporal sight and at the very instant that many thing be do in far distant place he will faithful relate they unto those that be present as it be many time find by experience and so often he foresee and foretell thing to come that it be a great work to rehearse all the particular among which one and not the lest be that he foretell what shall befall unto saint THOMAS of Canturbury long before it happen he foretell what shall hap pen to s. Thomas of Canturbury for when that renown bucklar of the church flourish yet in great grace and favour with king Henry GODRICK foretell that he shall short loose that place and be cast into banishment and bid he withal to be of a courageous and manly resolution and not to droop under the good cause which he have take in hand to defend for it will come to pass that within seven year he shall return to great honour out of banishment then ever he enjoy before but the same year that saint THOMAS come out of banishment he send a messenger to this holy hermit to know what he shall now expect after his long exile and what will be the event of his totter state that stand now almost out of all hope to who GODRICK in the presence and hear of our author answer that a kind of verbal peace shall be make between THOMAS and the king before the end of the next six month follow and that within nine month more he shall be restore to his archiepiscopal sea which he shall not long enjoy before a happy death that shall be to he healthful and glorious and to the whole country profitable do end the whole controversy between they and at the same time this holy man he foretel his own death foretell that the time of his own death shall be within the space of the six month follow all which most certain happen as he have foretell for saint THOMAS return be make legate of the sea apostolic a honour which he enjoy not before and be crown at his death with the glory of a most happy martyrdom 12 but now of how great reverence and admiration be this to he have the guiac of tongue be esteem in saint GODRICK that both at other time and principal at the sacred feast of Pentecost he be sudden by a heavenly grace adorn with the gift of tongue which on that day be bestow upon the apostle so that he both understand those that speak Latin of which tongue he be whole ignorant before and speak many thing in latin very ready and distinct again he command the water how notable and excellent a wonder be this that when the river be with a mighty inundation overflow all the adjoin country and possess place far high and strong yea overwhelm and overturn many tree and house yet the humble and almost straw-built habitation of GODRICK be not touch with one drop of water stand safe among those confuse stream to the great amazement of the whole country that judge he and house both to be bury together in destruction an other time when the same river begin furious to run over the bank he go forth as it be to meet that inundation and set up a little cross three pace from his poor cell he command those water in the name of our lord JESUS-CHRIST not to come beyond that mark when it be strange to see the water be come to that place swell up in height like unto a wall so that his humble cottage stand upon a dry shore entrench round about with a bulwark the fire obey (@) or sconce of water and in like manner as the water so do the fire likewise obey the voice of this holy man when have furious lay hold of his weak building it be sudden deprive of its devour force and at his only command ceaf from make any further spoil he raise a dead man 13 and now if according to the dignity and worth of the matter I shall set down the holy cure of afflict and lose person which by miracle he perform in so much that he raise one to life that have lie three day under the cruel arrest of death that alone will require a long discourse much exceed the bound of my purpose then which his so great good exercise towards the soul of the dead who by his devout prayer watch fast and other holy work he deliver from the cleanse pain of purgatory to the possession of the joy of heaven seem to i to be a benefit far great and more to be admire but above all these admirable work of GODRICK this hold the high place in my opinion that he be so divine adorn with such a heavenly grace that be yet in this mortal state he understand and see not only the soul of his fellow-champion of who we have already speak but allsoe the spirit of many other bless man both reward with eternal glory and receive into the heavenly dwelling and out of his divine manner of life which he lead here on earth he deserve to enjoy the company and conversation of angel and other heavenly citizen and especial of our great 8.

Marie Magdalen bless Marie the mother of CHRIST yea and CHRIST himself of who he receive many heavenly and ravish consolation far beyond the force of weak word to express and namely by the bless virgin Marie he be teach a divine canticle or song which afterward with great devotion he use oftentimes to repeat this allsoe be a most wonderful and a unspeakable benefit show he by s. PETER the apostle who celebrate the sacred mystery of mass before he s Peter give he the b. sacrament and have hear the confession which GODRICK make of all his sin give he a general and a apostolical absolution and minister the dreadful sacrament of the altar unto he and when our author come thither the same morning to say mass and demand in honour of what saint he shall celebrate that divine mystery of the bless virgin Marie answer Godrick for before thy come saint PETER the apostle have here offer the same sacrifice in honour of the most bless (@) but we shall never come to a end if we eudeavour to lo^^^ this paper with all the virtue grace and wonderful work of this bless man 14 therefore when he have live in this admirable manner his last sickness in one and the other desert for the space of threescore and six year and be as a oracle that astonish all England with his holy life so great a swell take possession of his face and all the other limb of his body that he appear not to be like unto the former shape of a man in his entrails he endure a cruel gripe pain as it be of live worm which run up and down his belly and consume he for which punishment as heretofore for other more grievous he give humble thanks unto almighty God that so gentle he voutchafe to purge he from his sin in this world and to good purpose say he do these worm consume my body in this life that the never-dying worm shall not gna^ and tear my soul in hell for the space of almost eight year he lay languish in bed be not able to rise but by the help of friendly hand at length his sickness daily increase and have now almost conquer his old age he send for his brethren who be come take he out of his bed and according to the manner of those devout time lay he upon the ground on a haircloth strew with ash put on his stamin and cowl for long since he have be a Benedictine monk of Durham and so that bless soul depart happy out of the thraldom of this his happy departure vale of misery to receive the perfect consummation of that heavenly life with CHRIST which he have begin in this world and at the same instant be hear a most heavenly melody ascend from his cell towards heaven he die the one and twentieth day of May in the year of our lord 1170. the same year that the worthy archbishop of Canturbury saint THOMAS suffer martyrdom for the defence of the church his body be bury in the chapel of s.

the sacred scripture whereby he exhort his scholar and brethren that be about he to awake out of the dullness of the soul by the remembrance of the last terrible hour add a speech in the mother-tongue of the fearful separation which death make between the soul and the bodi^ then he will sing hymn and anthime to the great consolation of himself and all the assistant till tear of devotion trickle

GUDWALL be of so he be make bishop great estimation in the world that he be advance to the height of ecclesiastical dignity and make bishop when by how much he be exalt high to honour among the people

Alban be apprehend lodging search narrow in every corner thereof and fill the whole house with noise and tumult till come to the little cottage where he and his master have pious spend their time the day before they find s. Alban in a strange habit barefcot humble pray before the sign of Christ holy cross then rush furious in troop upon he they apprehend he bind he and violent hale he some by the garment some by the hair to the presence of the judge who at that time in a great assembly of people be bysy employ in offer sacrifice to his diabolical idol but see Alban lead in that manner his heart boil with rage and fury against he because of his own accord he perceive he bend to hazard his life for who he have entertain therefore he command he to be draw before the idol threaten to make he suffer all the torment due unto his sacrilegious guest so his wicked tongue term holy because as a contemner of the god he have presume to conceal he from the officer and now seem himself to be depart from the profession of his ancient religion but s. Alban he contemn the threat of the judge who have willing betray himself to the persecutor of the christian faith without any sign of fear let pass the storm of the prince threat and fury and arm with the shield of the spiritual warfare bold and plain affirm that he will not obey his command then the judge demand of what family and race he be it appertain not to thou answer Alban to know my lineage but if thou desire to understand the truth of my religion know that I be a Christian and one that embrace all christian duty my parent call i Alban and I adore and worship the true live God the maker and creator of all thing then the judge swell with wrath and fury if thou desire say he to enjoy the happiness of life offer forthwith sacrifice to our great god these sacrifice reply saint Alban which by you be offer to devil can neither help the supplicant sacrificer nor accomplish the end of their desire but reward they in the end with the everlasting torment of Hell v. at these word the judge can no long contain his fury but command the holy confessor of CHRIST to be cruel beat he be cruel beat and torment hope with stripe to overthrow the resolution of his constancy which with word he can not move therefore the lictour execute their office of cruelty upon his holy body in most rude manner when amid the noise of their pitiless whip he joyful call upon the name of our lord JESUS-CHRIST make a willing oblation and sacrifice of himself to his divine goodness till the tormentor be weary with their vain punish and he nothing weary with constant suffering the people obtain to have he imprison for the space of six he be commit to prison month hope that time will wear out the purpose of his resolution in the mean while the heaven witness the injury do to the holy martyr for from the first day of his apprehension to the day of his martyrdom such a intolerable drought by the extremity of the sun heat rage in that province that the fruit of the earth be quite burn up and destroy which the heathen who heart nevertheless be freeze up against the holy flame of true charity judge to be do by the art magic of the imprison Christian therefore the wise of the country be assemble together to discuss this point saint Alban be call out of the horror of the prison to answer for himself at the bar he be release of their examination and be find not guilty they all grien at the injury and suffer in his suffering in so much that a sedition be rise among the citizen and his friend all stand up in his defence and free he out of his belove chain by which they think he injure have all way have the name and fame of a man of good life that he may render a account of his deed before the judge but saint Alban take this kind of mercy as a act of the great cruelty great fear lest his martyrdom shall be defer he exclaim a against idol 5 therefore stand in the midst of the whole assembly he make a new invective declamation against the weakness of their profane god and their blind folly in worship those blind idol whereby they be all incense afresh against he and with one voice pronounce he guilty of death then arise a great contention among they in define with what kind of death to punish he some as a disciple of the crucifix judge he to be crucify other will have he bury alive as enemy to their god the rest think fit to have his eye dig out and send so to seek out his master in fine the ^udge and all the people agree he be condemn to death and condemn he to loose his head therefore be again bind in chain he be rude drag to the design place of his martirdom call Holmhurst on the top of a fair plain hill who pleasantness seem worthy to be consecrate with the blood of our glorious martyr but the throng multitude of people that hasten to see this strange spectacle be so great that come to a large river over which they must pass to the hill the bridge be not able to receive they many that for haste endeavour to wade or swim over be by the fury of those wild stream carry down to a untimely death mean while s. Alban much grieve in mind to see the ruin of those perish soul and perceave his journey to the desire place of martyrdom to be hinder by that huge concourse of people fall down on his knee and humble make his prayer to he who side flow water and blood for the redemption of the world to give a safe passage to that people so desirous to be present at his death then by the almighty power a notable miracle of he that divide the red sea for the israelite the fury of that great river be stop and the channel make dry for the holy martyr to pass the flow of his prayer and tear before almighty God take from the river the power of flow and lay open a fair passage for himself and the people through the water 7 but the virtue of this wonderful miracle give grace to the officer that be appoint to be albans executioner to cast off all the executioner convert thought of such like wolvish cruelty and become a meek lamb of Christ flock for throw away his sword that shall have do that bloody deed he fall prostrate at the holy martyr foot confess his error and humble demand pardon cry aloud that there be no other true God but the god of the christian and earnest desire to die in steed of he who he be command to put to death but his belief move the rest of those minister of mischief to great rage and fury and fall upon that new confessor of CHRIST they beat out his tooth tear his mouth that have give testimony to the truth and so bruise all his limb with cruel blow that in his whole body scarce any one part be leave unhurt yet in heart he remain firm and sound in the confession of his faith but leave this wretched creature in that miserable plight they arrive at length be cruel beat to the top of the hill where a infinite number of people be expect to behold the action of this tragical scene who be general torment with a extremity of heat and drought he obtain a fountain by his prayer s. Alban by his prayer obtain to have a clear fountain spring out of that dry earth by which the multitude quench their thirst yet always thirst for the effusion of his blood by who merit they have receive that benefit so great be the ungrateful cruelty and cruel ingratitude of their blind mind which ascribe all these most sensible miracle to the power of their own senseless god 8 therefore whet still the edge of their own fury on the unshake rock of the holy martyr constancy and virtue they he be behead be more and more incense to the shed of his innocent blood a new executioner be choose to give the deadly blow for they all who at once make a cruel separation of his head from the body that his bless soul may take a happy flight to the crown of everlasting life which our lord have promise to those that suffer for his sake but the cruel executioner be not permit to triumph in his wicked fact for his eye ashamed as it be to the punishment of his executioner behold their master cruelty fall miraculous out of his head at the very instant that he give the martyr his death so that lose the guide that have direct he to do what he do he lose allsoe the power to see what he have do which miracle cause many of the gentile there present to confess that he be just punish mean while the poor soldier who they have leave half dead below have crall to the top of the hill and come to the holy body of saint Alban he be present restore again to the perfect use of all his limb but that happiness be soon after second with a far great for make profession of the faith of a soldier martyr CHRIST he be forthwith behead and by be baptize in his own blood be make worthy to follow his leader saint Alban into the everlasting joy of christ-iesus the eternal crown and glory of his martyr s.

Alban who at the earnest desire of king Offa and the whole country he have enrol into the number of canonize saint be know to be the first martyr of Britain so the abbot of his monastery shall always have the precedence before all the other abbot of that country and that abbey be account the principal and head of the rest the abbot of this s. Alban the head ab^ey of England monastery in time past be baron of the realm and parliament man and from the abbey the town build there ^ be to this present call by the name of Sainct-Albans 11 but a far great and more excellent honour come to this monastery by the wonderful miracle which almighty God wrought there by the merit of this glorious martyr s.

Alban three hundred forty and odd year after s. germane come into England as Matthew Westminster William of malmesbury and other english writer do testify therefore his body can not be carry out of England by saint German moreover in Surius who I take to be the chief author of the adverse opinion I can but admire one thing as a sign of great partiality in he for have gather the whole life of saint Alban out of venerable bede he willing pass over in silence that act of saint germane put the relic into saint Alban tomb and carry away of the earth imbrue with his blood and why do he so I leave the reason to the judgement of the judicious reader be loath to touch the authority of so great a man it may be because he be himself of Cullen he have rather for the honour of his town report it to be enrich with the whole body of saint Alban then only with some of the dust of his tomb use a figurative speech of rhetorician and put the whole for a part. or else the identity author that affirm his body to be a s. Alba^s of the name of saint Alban martyr of Mentz and our saint Alban of England draw he to report that of we which he shall have say of the other howsoever he be deceive this much we can say on our own behalf ommit to make a argument of the unliklihood of the contrary assertion that Matthew Paris in the year 1179. Matthew Westminster in the year 1259. Walsingham in the year 1313. Henry Huntingdon in the nine book of his history Thomas Rudburne in his great chronicle and other english writter of great credit and authority and far more conversant in our history then any stranger can be do constant affirm that the sacred relic of saint Alban remain always in his own monastery in England and this the ancient record of the same place which I have in my hand do large testify by the undiscontinued relation of the yearly miracle wrought at his tomb to the reign of he^^y the second and in the year of grace 1257. certain workman that be busy in repair the church of saint Alban dig somewhat deep into the ground happen upon the marble tomb in which his body have be lay present after his martyrdom at which time a heavenly splendour shine over his grave and the ravish note of angelical harmony warble four the praise of the holy martyr but the garment of saint Alban his garment find spot with fresh blood master in which saint Alban suffer martyrdom be afterward carry to the benedicti^e monastery of Ely and there in a certain tomb reserve which king Edward the second cause to be open in his own presence when it be find uncorrupted and stain with fresh spot of the blood which he have s^ed for CHRIST who be for ever glorify in his saint amen all ecclesiastical writer make very honourable mention of s. Alban of who among other Fortunatus sing this verse and hiericus a Frenchman who flourish seven hundred year ago have these verse of he in the life of saint German in which he mention the executioner loss of his eye his life we have gather out of venerable bede in his history of England and a other old author ancient than bede which we have in write hand and beside the writer above name Gyldas epist Geffrey of Monmouth hist. brit. lib. 5. cap. 5. the roman martirologe Vsuard Molanus and other do large speak his praise in the Sarum breviary he have a office of nine lesson and in a ancient manuscript breviary of s. benedict order which belong to Burton upon Trent he be serve with twelve lesson whereof eight be proper and which make large mention of his life and miracle a appendix to the life of saint Alban contain the passion of saint AMPHIBALUS and other martyr at the same time june 22 out of a ancient manuscript cite before the famous miracle which go before and follow the death of our glorious protomartir saint Alban move the miracle of s. Alban convert many many of the astonish assistant to be far better affect to the christian faith than they be in so much that have they have but a teacher it seem they may easy be bring not only to approve but to embrace it for truth be of their own accord already well incline thereunto nether be the divine goodness want to their good will in this point by who instinct one bold than the rest stand up and in this manner speak unto they if only with word o fellow-citizen Alban have maintain the truth of a citizen speech to his fellow his faith it be not to be admire if all man have reject it as vain and unprofitable doctrine condemn by public law and contrary not only to the institution of our ancestor but even to reason the guide of all thing but now since he have confirm his word and faith with such admirable work whosoever shall presume to deny it will seem in resist Alban to resist God himself by affirm that these wonderful sign proceed from any other author but God or that that faith be not ground in truth which be authorize by the testimony of such divine work for when I pray you do our god ever perform the like when be the like hear off in our religion moreover the singular integrity the praise of s. Alban meekness patience constancy piety and other virtue of of this divine man do set he forth among his other wonderful work for the great wonder be vex with so many taunt and reproach he revile no man be afflict with so many injury he be so far from make the lest show of any indignation of mind that he seem more tobewayle our case then his own nay he go with so joyful and clear a countenance to his last deadly punishment that one will have judge he go to a banquet of mirth and not to the scaffold of death who do not see in this man a divine power great than humane frailty if than these gift do proceed only from God sure he be not wont to bestow they on wicked impious and sacrilegious person but on those that pious and holy serve and worship he nether be it to be doubt but that he will adorn we and our common wealth with these and far great gift than these if we show ourselves pliant and dutiful to his divine call let we therefore follow Alban our captain and courageous embrace his faith and piety which God grant to be fortunate and happy to we our child and our common wealth 2 these and such like word be speak in a great assembly of the citizen of verulam all public proclaim that then the religion of CHRIST nothing be more divine nothing more holy nothing more true therefore they resolve to search the whole country over to find out AMPHIBALUS A^BANS guest who be a teacher of the christian discipline but he be go into Wales where with so happy success he have cast abroad the divine seed of the gospel that he have fill all the country thereabouts with fruit of the evangelicall harvest and the sweet odour of his own fame and name whereupon the citizen of verulam to the number of about a thousand leave their house and home and follow the send of his holy deed and virtue come at length to AMPHIBALUS who have understand of the martirdom of his dear host Alban they be baptize and the cause of their come thither receive they all to the sacrament of the christian faith which they desire and they joyful embrace those divine institution be incense daily with so ardent a desire to profit and perfect themselves in their new-receaved faith that the multitude of faithful christian grow every day great in number and more famous and renown in sanctity 3 but the ancient and common enemy of mankind perceave the evangelicall kingdom to be amplify daily with such joyful increase and his possession to be great diminish by these purchase judge it high time to oppose himself against those proceed and to that end he incense the citizen against their fellow-cittizen those remain at verulam against the other who AMPHIBALUS have now make citizen of the kingdom of heaven against who the burgess of the earth be incense with the fury of the prince of darkness determine to raise a cruel war ground their quarrel on no other theme than that their fellow citizen have forsake the desire and love of the world and be by the mean of AMPHIBALUS range into the warfare of Christ a thousand christian cruel murder holy gospel march therefore against they when they perceive they to be so resolute in the opinion of their new-receaved faith that with courageous mind they be ready to expose their neck to the furious sword of their persecutor set aside all thought either of the name of fellow-cittizen or affinity of blood or dignity of their innocence they make a furious assault upon they be unarm and in most cruel manner bathe their sword in the blood of their own fellow and countryman they in the mean time joyful and willing offer their body to the deadly blow of Christ enemy whereby his triumphant church be adorn with the fresh rose of new troop of holy martyr 4 but apprehend the captain of this holy war AMPHIBALUS reserve for great pain in the midst of those murder body they bring he back to verulam to be there reserve for great and more exquisite torment whither when the news of his come arrive all the town flock out to meet he though not in courtesy but to revenge on he the loss of their fellow-cittizen and kindred of who slaughter they judge he to be the sole and principal author therefore fall violent upon he with so great inhumanity they torment and beat the body of the holy man that they leave no place thereof without the cruel mark of many hurt and wound all which he be report to have endure with so great fortitude of mind that no sign of anger or trouble appear in his countenance when all man hold it for a miracle as indeed it be that his age body be able to endure so many and so great torment with such a unmoved constancy and that they can not force his soul out of that weak lodging with such pain the lest whereof seem more than sufficient to martyr the strong champion in the world v all be astonish and many much grieve at this spectacle many convert to Christ make as the manner be diverse interpretation and construction of the matter some impute it to witchcraft other to a divine power in so much that there want not those that affirm it to be a most unworthy act to exercise so many torment on a innocent man which without note of great cruelty can not be inflict on the wicked malefactor that ever be for what offence be it say they to draw man from the horrible rite of profane sacrifice and from a savage manner of life to a holy and pious way of serve God therefore because AMPHIBALUS teach these thing we ought rather to honour his virtue with all due reverence and with benefit to requite he labour for the common good then so ungrateful and cruel to persecute his innocence and this proceed seem to they to besoe unwarrantable that they feafeared not to affirm the patient to be most grateful to God in suffer such cruelty for virtue sake and the doer themselves to they be martyr with s. be of God most hate for so outrageous persecute a poor innocent on these then speak in this manner and recommend themselves to CHRIST and the prayer of AMPHIBALUS the

in so fair a throne of beauty but she contemn all worldly pleasure aspire only and whole to the bedchamber of her eternal spouse christ-iesus for who love she desire always to preserve her chastity untouched sing continual spiritual hymn and canticle to his honour and praise and daily sacrifice herself unto almighty God in the mean time the divine wisdom so dispose it and that her unshake resolution of chastity may in this world be make more famous and deserve a great crown of victory and triumph in the next she be earnest she marry against she will desire in marriage by one Tunbert a prince of the south part of the i will of Ely who have obtain her father consent judge himself sure of his desire till the flat refusal of the holy virgin make he perceive that more than one word be requisite to a bargain then her father interpose his royal authority his virtuous daughter etheldred obey use violence to her own desire to make they subject to her father will therefore be marry in royal manner to the forename prince behold that which amaze the fond world and worldling she be find worthy to imitate the bless virgin Marie and to lead a chaste life together with her husband if he may be call a husband who never rob a chaste marriage bed his spouse of her virginity but albeit they be not as two in one flesh yet be they both of one mind in devotion pass over their day in prayer alm deed and other good work for both party be consent to the observance of chastity till a happy death make a separation of that pious union and call Tunbert into a other world to receive the everlasting reward of his continent and chaste life when he have live in the band of a unexperienced wedlock the space of almost three year 3 than although our holy virgin etheldred pious lament she retire to Ely the death of her husband yet in heart she rather rejoice that now she be free from the yoke of matrimony hope by that mean more easy to escape the vain allurement of the world therefore in her own house at Ely she begin to lead a most retire and devout life hope in that place which be a island encompass with store of shady wood more secure to avoid the vain honour of the world there her devotion increase daily and her pious desire be more and more enkindle with the fire of the holy ghost but now her former labour be overcome she be to be draw out and range into a great conflict that the palm and glory of her virginity may more excellent be make manifest to the world for egsrid king of the Northumber make very earnest suit to have she for his wife to which his petition although her second ma^^^ge to king ^gfrid to she it seem rather odious then glorious yet be overcome by the importunity of her friend she unwilling yield and for the gain of a great triumph over those vain pleasure again she put her virginity to the hazard of marriage but with king Egfrid who be a young man that boil in the flower and ardour of youthly year she endure a far great combat always remain unconquered in who the love of heaven be so powerful that it still preserve her holy purpose free from all carnal desire a stray resolution of c^asttie and in her king palace where other lady be wont to be inflame with those unchaste fire she burn with the flame of his heavenly love who the angel desire to behold and gaze on in a word for the space of twelve year our pious virgin etheldred live in a holy marriage with her husband king Egfrid without suffer any the lest blemish to her virginity a thing so worthy of admiration that it be hard to say whether the constancy of she or the patience of he that boil with love be more to be praise and admire sure I be that among many thousand you shall scarce find one able so to bridle the unbridled desire of the rebellious flesh 4 in the mean time king Egfrid who be desirous to have king egfrids desire to overthrow her chastity heir to succeed he in the kingdom labour by all mean set violence aside to get his wife to consent unto his desire and yield unto he that only desire the right of matrimony etheldred on the other side who have dedicate her virginity to the king of heaven can not be remove nether by the allurement of his pleasant word nor with the terror of his rude threat to betray the resolution of her holy purpose therefore the king who by nature be of a courteous and please inclination of mind although by how much the more constant his wife deny his request by so much the more eager his love burn in the pursuit thereof for thing deny be more greedy desire yet he always withhold his hand from violence and to the end he may leave no way unbeaten that may lead to the mark of his affection he commit the matter to s. wilfrid archbishop of York hope that his authority will be powerful enough to beat down the fortress of her resolution and the rather because he know how great confidence the holy queen repose in the man but s. wilfrid quick find all his labour in persuade to be employ in vain so unconquered the holy virgin remain in she foretaken purpose of chastity v. nay she not only refuse to condescend to the point of the etheldred labour to have her husband consent to a divorce king desire but allsoe cease not with her daily prayer to solicit he that with his leave and licence she may be free from the bond of matrimony and betake herself to embrace a single and private manner of life which at length by much importunity she obtain for Egfrid who be a prudent prince can not choose but love and honour the purpose of chastity in his wife know that she have dedicate it to CHRIST JESUS therefore etheldred be now mistress of her desire liberty retire herself to a monastery she take the habit of a nun of Benedictine nun at a place call coldingham in the confine of Scotland where bless EBBA aunt unto king Egfrid be abbess of a holy convent of virgin among these our holy etheldred make her royal robe give place to the humble weed of a nun and instead of her princely diadem of sovereignty she adorn her head with the poor veil of humility make herself from a commandress a subject from a princess a handmaid from a queen a servant yea now it be that this holy woman judge herself true to reign when be free from her terrene kingdom she be range into the service of CHRIST and undertake for his love the rule of monastical discipline she subject herself to the rod of holy obedience and find by she own daily experience that the yoke of our lord be sweet her holy conversation and his burden light in this place she attain to so great a height of holy conversation and show so perfect a example of humility that her life appear to the rest of her sister as a true pattern and mirror of all monastical perfection 6 but king Egfrid impatient bear the departure of his belove queen begin at length to be much contrislate thereat and by instinct and instigation of his noble he endeavour with violent a strange miracle mean to take she out of the monastery which his intention be understand by the holy virgin she recomend her virginity to almighty God and with two other of her fellow flee for safeguard into a hill near adjoin where by the divine power of he that govern and command the wind and sea she be miraculous preserve out of his hand for the sea overflow its usual limit encompass that hill about in such sort that the king admire the accident dare attempt no further but return sorrowful Thomas Monach. in hist. that he have go so far and the author hereof do testify that while she live with her company on the top of this hill she obtain by her prayer to have a fountain of clear water to spring out of the earth to comfort they in their extremity of thirst and allsoe that the impression of her footstep ascend and descend the same hill remain visible in the rock unto the same author time all which do most evident prove of how great meritt her holy life and untainted chastity be in the sight of her dear spouse christ-iesus the fountain and head of all purity but because we be fall into such time that a great part of the world hold vow of chastity to be unnecessary and the virtue of chastity itself impossible especial between marry folk therefore it shall not be amiss here to set down the testimony of venerable bede and saint wilfrid for a unresistable proof of our holy etheldreds virginity when the matter be by some call in question say s. bede wilfrid bishop of bless gest an. lib. 4. cap. 6. a notable testimony of her virginity memory affirm to i that demand it that he himself be a most certain witness of her virginity in so much that king Egfrid promise he a reward of many land and treasure if he can but persuade the queen to yield to the use of marriage because he know she love ^oe man better than he nether aught we to mistrust that also in our age that be possible to be do which our faithful history relate to have be do in former time by the gift of one and the same lord who promise to remain with we to the end of the world for the divine miracle whereby the flesh of the same woman bury can not be corrupt be a sign that she remain incorrupted from the touch of man thus saint bede whereby be make manifest the undefiled integrity of this holy Virgin who albeit she shed not her blood by martyrdom yet she may be just entitle etheldred a martyr with the name of a martyr when fight glorious against the vice and concupiscence of this world she daily carry our lord cross in her body and if she have happen in the bloody time of Nero or diocletian without doubt like unto other holy virgin and martyr of God church she will of her own accord have endure the torture fight with the wild beast go through the fire and not have fear to have have her body tear in piece with the instrument of study cruelty which the iron-heart of those time make use off but let we go on with her life 7 a year after she have receive the veil of religion in the monastery above name she return to her own possession in the i will of Ely which be her dowry give by her first husband Tonbert and the place destine for the perpetual habitation of she and her successor but travel this long journey on foot accompany only with two other sister be all more than usual weary with the labour and heat of the way they sit down under the protection of a shady grove a while to refresh their tire body with a desire rest where after a short sleep they arise and as it be a strange miracle constant report by the author of her life they find the holy virgin staff which she have stick in the ground at her head to be miraculous grow into a fair green tree which afterward come to be a mighty ash big than any of the same kind in all that country and the place be ever after call by the name of Etheldredstowe where a church be build in honour of the holy virgin and in memory of this miraculous accident 8 at the i will of Ely therefore she at length arrive where in Ely first build by s. Augustine time past as many author affirm saint Augustine our apostle have build a monastery at the charge of ethelbert king of Kent and dedicate it to the bless virgin Marie and place therein a convent of Benedictine monk about the year of our lord six hundred but afterward when Penda that tyrannous king of the mercian have lay to waste all the country of the east-angle that monastery be allsoe make to fall into the confusion of a untimely ruin which now our holy etheldred not only re-edify again but allsoe restore to a far great state of glory when many other virgin draw thither with the fame of her holy life and virtue range themselves into the discipline of a regular life under her government for by the authority of s. wilfrid she be make abbess of the same place so that within a short time she etheldred make abbess of Ely have gather a worthy convent of holy Benedictine nun that night and day sing the praise of almighty God and lead a most strict and holy life then by the mean of the same saint wilfrid and the instance of our holy virgin this new monastery of Ely be establish with many privilege and liberty by the authority of the pope and exempt from the jurisdiction and power of bishop 9 but with how great sanctity virtue and pious example of with how great virtue she govern life our holy etheldred govern the same monastery with how great continency she live and with what heavenly gift and grace she be adorn by almighty GOD it far exceed the weakness of this pen to rehearse from her first entrance into the monastery she never use any other clothing but of woollen which she wear also next unto her skin she seldom make use of warm bath a thing much practise in those day but against the great solemnity of the year as easter whitsuntide and the like nether then will she take they but after all the rest of her sister when she have first play the part of a diligent servant in help they in that act in her diet she be so spare that she always content herself with on small meal a day unless either the solemnity of some great feast her own infirmity of body or some other great cause compel she to enlarge her ordinary allowance in divine prayer and contemplation she be so untired that after the performance of the midnight office in the choir she always continue her devotion in the church till the next morning hereupon the divine goodness that be never want to his servant adorn his virtuous spouse with the grace of do many miraculous cure on the body of possess and disease person and also endow she with the gift of prophecy by virtue whereof she foretell the come of a inevitable sickness to the monastery which to she and many of her sister shall be the messenger of death specify withal the certain number of those that shall come under the cruel arrest of that fearful seargeant x. at length the time draw near in which the spouse of all she fall sick pure soul christ-iesus have determine to take this his belove spouse out of the frail bark of this mortal state to the heavenly dwelling of his glorious kingdom she be attach with a sickness which bring with it such a cruel swell and imposthume in her neck and throat that her body grow daily to lower and low degree of weakness she be compel to entertain both those incommodity in her bed when albeit the swell give her most sharp feeling of her pain she nevertheless be attentive to her accustom devotion cease not to render thanks unto almighty God who use the scourge of a pious chastisement to correct those he true love then nothing but weep and lament be to be see or hear in the house her family and the people adjoin grieve to loose so good a mistress and her holy and chaste choir of virgin sorrow more than can be express with fear to be divide from so good a mother only she herself for who be make all this lamentation seem in heart and countenance most joyful who confidence in the divine goodness be such and so great that she be nothing terrify with the apprehension and fear of death and when the pain of her imposthume give she the sharp remembrance she seem much delight therewith and endure it as the delight and ornament of her glory use these word to the bystander most certain I know that I deserve suffer this swell in my neck about which in my youth I be wont to wear many vain bracelet and golden ornament of pride therefore I give hearty thanks unto the divine goodness that thence my grief spring where I be wont to make show of a delightful vanity and I believe and trust that my pious redeemer by afflict i with this pain will merciful absolve i from the punishment due unto my former levity a rare example of virtue * * Harpsfield saec. 7. c. 24. our english woman be wont to wear about their neck a certain chain make of fine small silk which we call etheldreds chain it may be in memory of what we have here say and will to God this monument will stir up our mind as indeed it ought to imitate the virtue and holy life of s. etheldred which sure be the end for which it be first institute and use and the same I wish unto those peer and noble man both of England and other nation who carry a chain about their neck call a collar of s. s. which letter signify the name of saint Simplicius who bear of the blood of roman senator generous suffer death for the love of CHRIST true then these chain will become of no less ornament both to man and woman then in time past that chain be to Titus Manlius the roman which be provoke to battle he have take from his conquer enemy whereupon he afterward be surname Torquatus from which in latin signify a chain but let we return to saint etheldred 11 therefore whilst this holy virgin lie amid the torment of a most cruel sickness give thanks unto her creator for so pious a visitation boil with a desire to be dissolve to live with CHRIST some of the assistant in who yet remain a small hope of her recovery cause a skilful chirurgean to lance the swell place and make way for that corrupt matter to issue forth as be stuff to base and loathsome to be imprison in so pure a body which do the holy virgin seem for two day space to be great ease of her pain and to wax better in health so she seem to recover that many conceive a new hope that she may escape this danger which be cause of great joy unto her friend and sister but all this be but as a glimpse of lightue before death for the three day when all wound and incision be most panifull she herself perceave that the happy minute of her wish departure be at hand cause the whole convent of nun to be gather together about she unto who have first signify that her hour of death be come she impart as well as the violence of her pain will suffer she the die word of her last farewell so full of the sweetness of divine document and devotion that she wonderful move the mind and heart of they all to the love of heaven and heavenly thing then have strengthen her journey with the of our lord holy body she render up her pure soul into the pure hand of her creator and end this mortal her happy de^th life enter into that which never end leave the whole convent of her devout sister so overcharge with sorrow that not be able to contain so hard a burden within door their compassionate eye let forth lively sign thereof to ease the heaviness of their pious heart this glorious virgin die the 23. day of june in the year of our

eminent place in the church therefore a day be appoint for the more solemn execution of this translation a great multitude of devout people flock thither to be present at that act among who also be s. wilfrid archbishop of York and Kinefrid the chirurgean that two day before her departure have make the incision in her neck which we speak of before but before they open her sepulchre the holy abbess SEXBURG send some of the monk to provide a tomb^stone miraculous find for her body a stone to be the tomb of those sacred relic who because the i will of Ely itself be a place encompass round with water and marsh be void of all manner of stone of such greatness go to a little town not far from thence call Grandacester where near unto the wall of the same town they straight find a fair tomb curious cut in white marble with a cover of the same matter most just fit thereunto all much amaze at this good fortune especial because the neighbour people affirm that they have never before see any such stone in that place they understand that our lord the wonder-working spouse of the glorious virgin etheldred have miraculous prosper their journey and provide a shrine for her holy body therefore sing hymn of praise and thanks unto his divine goodness they bring the new-found tombstone to the monastery which be a great comfort and encouragement to the virtuous abbess to hearten she to proceed in the execution of her intend purpose her body find uncorrupted after sixteen year 13 therefore all thing be worthy order and prepare the whole convent come in procession and stand sing about the sepulchre which be cover and hide under a pavilion then the abbess with some other enter into it to take up the holy body which be discover they find to be as whole fair fresh and uncorrupted as the

be now so perfect cure that there remain only to be see a small and slender scar as a token of what it have be before so that the earth which be wont to corrupt and consume the dead body of other mortal man serve here as a sovereign balm not only to preserve her virginal flesh uncorrupted but even to cure and heal the wound make therein then the body be elevate to the public view of the whole

chastity during her life have preserve her body allsoe from all spot of corruption for the space of sixteen year after her death and of this be witness beside many other great s. wilfrid and Kinfrid the chirurgean who be a faithful recorder of this accident be gest lib. 4. c. 9 wont to relate the same as it be here write unto venerable bede and other as bede himself do testify affirm also that not only the body but the linen clothes in which it be wrap be find also to be as entire and new as the first day they be employ to enclose that chaste body 14 than have wash the sacred body and shroud it in fresh clothes fit to contain so worthy a treasure they place it with great reverence in the new and miraculous tomb of white marble which they find to be so fit in length and bigness to

which she have found in her life time this translation or elevation of her holy body be perform on the seaventeenth day of October and sixteme year after her death many great miracle be afterward wrought there at her tomb and the only touch of the clothes that her body have be wrap in drive devil out of the body of possess person and cure many disease by the power of he that be all way wonderful in his saint and the wooden chest in which her body have be first bury heal many of sore eye by only lay their head close unto it and in their prayer call on the help of almighty God and the intercession of his glorious virgin s. etheldred also out of the place where she be first bury spring forth a fountain of clear water which be prove to be most sovereign for many disease even until the time of our author who have see the experience thereof himself diverse other miracle be faithful relate by this author Thomas of Ely to have be wrought in the same monastery by the merit in the cript history of Ely of this glorious Virgin there the blind recover their sight the dumb their speech the lame the use of their leg the their hearing and almost all kind of disease person be restore to perfect health as may be see at large in the history of Ely 15 but as this holy virgin be pious gracious to all that devout the divine punishmennt against one that wrong her tomb implore her assistance in their necessity so be she many time no less terrible in punish those that malicious endeavour to wrong her tomb church or any thing belong thereunto for proof whereof it shall suffice to relate one example only in that outrageous spoil which the barbarous Danes mad throughout the kingdom of England during the troublesome raignee of the two king etheldred and Elfred when all church Monastery and religious house together with their inhabitant be commit to fire and sword the monastery of Ely be also make a prey to their untamed cruelty when one of those pagan more prone to wickedness then the rest attempt to break open the holy shrine of saint etheldred hope to find it furnish with store of golden treasure which his covetous mind great thirst after and have with much labour make a hole through the marble chest which remain in the same until our author time the divine punishment be so sudden against he that his unworthiness be not suffer to behold the treasure contain therein for at the very same instant his eye fall out of his head and he himself fall down to the earth vomit out his miserable soul to carry news to the next world how severe God punish those that wrong the relic of his saint and his wretched end teach his fellow not to presume to touch that sacred tomb albeit they commit the church and monastery to the unsatiable flame of fire but after a long desolation in the time of the peaceable reign kind Edgar repair the church of Ely of the most noble king Edgar the same monastery be magnificent restore to its former and a far great glory by the royal munificence of the same king and the secular clerk that have creep into it in the mean time be for their incontinency and bad life cast out by the mean of that worthy pillar of the english
