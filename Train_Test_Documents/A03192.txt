A CURTAINE
LECTURE.
CHAP. I.

Rare things in women. Nature
teacheth them modesty.
Of those that inveigh
against their sexe. Many
illustrious women remembred
as presidents for
others to imitate.

IT was the opinion
of Pythagoras that a
serpent is engendered
from the marrow in the

backe bone of a man deceased,
and cast into the fields
without buriall: upon which
it is observed, that as the fall
and death of man came by
the serpent, so the life of the
serpent comes by the death
of man. And since the first
back-sliding of Adam there
hath beene such an antipathy
betwixt the seed of the
woman and the serpent, that
if the naked sole of her foot
shall tread upon his head,
though never so lightly, yet
the weight thereof is more
ponderous and fatall unto
him, than if he were beaten
with mallets, or a rocke or
mountain should precipitate

it selfe upon him; for with
her bare touch he instantly
expireth. But if hee shall
but bite the heele of a man
(for at that still is his aime)
the poison disperseth it selfe
through all the parts of his
body, from which proceedeth
speedy and inevitable
death.
A second thing worthy
remarke is, to consider how
provident nature hath beene
to teach women bashfulnesse
and modesty in their
lives, by concealing their
immodest parts after their
deaths: for it is familiar amongst
us, that if a man be
drown'd, his gallis no sooner

burst, but he riseth with his
face upward: but if a woman
perish in the water, she
swims with her face downward:
of which some give
this reason, Omne leve fertur
sursum, etc. As every
light thing naturally ascends
up into the aire, and
that which is weighty stoopeth
it selfe downe to the
earth; so a man being broad
and heavie in the shoulders,
and but thin and light in the
breasts, the more ponderous
parts sinke, and those lesse
heavie appeare above the
waters: when on the contrary,
a woman being narrow
and spare shouldred,

but more fleshie and tumerous
in the breast, by the
weight thereof they smother
and obscure her modest
cheekes in the water, as if even
in death she apprehended
that the rest were unseemly
to be exposed unto
the aire.
But in this my progresse
intended to the praise of
their much honoured sexe,
I encountred with many
difficulties and interposures
able to deterre me from my
purpose; for in turning over
the leaves of some both
moderne and forreigne writers,
I have met with so many
satyricall invectives aimed

directly against it, and
some of them so pathetically
bitter, that I am halfe perswaded
they had quite forgot
themselves to have been
borne of mothers. Mantuan
in one of his Eclogues
writes thus:
Foemineum servile genus,
etc.
which in my thoughts, in
the generality is so adverse
to all charity, and refractory
to common experience,
that I am loath to make it
vulgar, or teach it to speake
our English language. Plautus
in Milite saith, What

thing can be worse or more
audacious than a woman?
And in Bacchid. Nothing is
more tempting or contagious
to the life of a young
man, than the opportunity
of night, the operation of
wine, and the blandishments
of a woman. Ovid in his
fi^st book of Elegies, though
not in the same words, yet
includes the same sense: and
these, with many other, he
reckoneth, not as accidents
appertaining to some, but
adherents belonging to all;
as borne with them in their
infancie, encreasing with
them in their growth, and
inseparable from them

till their last dissolution: others
for divers irregularities
task them in particular.
Ovid tells us there is no
heed or regard to be taken
of their teares, as commanding
them at their will, and
exposing them at their pleasure.
Neve puellarum lacrymi^
moveare caveto, etc.With womens teares be not
thou mov'd at all,For as they please they keep
or let them fall.
And in another place:
What cannot Art? They to
deceive poore menHave learnt by practise how
to weep, and when.
Elsewhere he inveigheth
against their fantasticall habits,
paintings, borrowed or
bought haire, etc. Some
call them unfaithfull, light,
inconstant, as Catullus: others
more moveable than
the winds, as Calphurnius:
some hold their societie
meerly unnecessary, as
that an house or familie is
much better and more quiet
without them. Plautus saith,
Mulier recte olet cum nil
olet, a woman is then at the
best when sh^ is not at all.
Againe, a question being

asked whether it were better
to marry with a maid or
a widdow? Answer is returned,
Malum quod minimum
est, id minimum est malum.
He that can avoid their
fellowship, let him shun it;
let him beware the day before,
that he repent him not
the day after. Of their frowardnesse
and perversenesse
Terence admonisheth us,
saying most truely and essentially,
I am acquainted with
the wits and dispositions of
women; they will not when
thou wouldest, and when
thou wouldest not, then
they will. Of their wrangling
and litigiousnesse Iuvenal

thus speaketh:
Nulla fere causa est in quam
non foemina litem, etc.There is no cause in Court,
nor act in State,From which a woman cannot
ground debate.
And to that purpose hee introduceth
one Manilia, a
bold-fac't Roman Matron,
who being full of cont^oversie,
and through her
wrangling having many
suits in agitation, blusht not
in open Court to bee her
owne Advocate, and plead
her owne causes in publike

assemblies. They are further
challenged to effacinate
the hearts and spirits of the
most valiant, to tame even
the Giant tam^rs; neither
their manly courage nor
invincible puissance being
^ble to resist their whorish
seducements: for so saith
Seneca in Hercule furente.
Many more to this purpose
I could produce in priorem
partem, but I am affraid
lest these few may (to
some) appeare too many. I^
therefore followes that
these discouragements past
over, I come now to emboldening
and animation;
which I shal better illustrate

by pr^sident and example.
For, as Epicuru^ saith, more
faith is to be given to example
than precept. A^d Seneca
in his Epistles saith*
long is the journey that is
taken by precept, but short
and speedy that which is
proposed by example. Omphulus
in his booke De imitatione
thus discourseth:
The greatest commendation
both of ingenuous arts
and civill actions is comprised
within the limits of
imitation: the studie of
which, either in managing
publike or private affaires,
begetteth in us both an alacritie
and magnitude. For

by calling to remembrance
the famous and notable acts
of illustrious persons, and
conforming our selves unto
all such things as were in
them worthy both of observation
and imitation, it inflames
us with a noble desire,
and an exurgent ambition,
by their president and
examp^e to aspire unto that
celsitude of honour and renowne*
to which they arrived
before us. This counsell
I therefore purpose to follow:
and, beginning with
those created in the beginning,
d^aw a president of
good women, even to these
our later ages.
Adam and Evah were
our first parents; and hee
who gave names to all the
creatures of the earth, called
her Hevah, which implies,
the mother of mankind;
from whom are descended
even those degenerates that
so maliciously calumnizethe
sexe: just like the young
Asse colts, who having
suckt their fills, kicke their
dams; for so it was said of
Aristotle for spurning at his
master Plato, from whom he
had suckt and drawne all his
rudiments of Philosophie.
But as there was an Evah
by whom sin came into the
world, to the utter subversion

of the soule of man; so
likewise there was a Mar^e,
the pure, bless^d, and immaculate
Virgin, through
whom was repaired and
restored what in the other
was fo^feited and lost. To
fetch our imitable women
as farre as from the time of
the first Patriarks: Abraham
had a Sarah, and Isaac a
Rebecca. Come to the
Judges: Lapidoth had a
Debora, who was a Prophetesse,
and a deliverer of I^rael.
We reade that Ioachim
had a Susanna, and that
churlish Nabal had a liberall
minded Abigail; and of
Manasses widow Iudith,

who taking upon her a masculine
spi^it, Virago-like cut
off the head of Holophernes.
Come to the nationall
Kings: Ulysses had a constant
Penelope in Greece, and
King Priam was the husband
of a fertile Hecuba in
Asia. Amongst the Romans
Iulius Caesar, the first perpetuall
D^ctatour, had an
indulgent Calphurnia; and
Augustus his Successour a
Matron-like Livia. In the
time of the Consuls, Collatine
might boast of an un^imitable
Lucrece; and the
first Africanus of a Tertia
Aemilia, for her vertues

scarce to be parallel'd. Strabo
tels us of an Arte^isia,
Q^eene of Caria, the illustrious
wife of King Mausolus;
and Livy, Frontinus,
and others, of an excellent
Chiomara, the wife of Origiant^s
Regulus.
Come to the ancient and
grave Philosophers: Plato
had his Astionissa, and Aristotle
his Hermia; the famous
Physician Nicostratus,
his Antecyra; Periander,
one of the seven Sages
of Greece (as Pythenetus
Lib. de Aegina relates) was
enamoured on the vertuous
Melissa; and the grave Socrates
(as Xenophon makes

mention of him) was devoted
to the love of Theodota;
and the famous Marcus
Cicero to his Terentia, etc.
If wee examine the ancient
Poets, not one of them
but had a Mistresse whom
to celebrate. Amongst the
Romans, Tibullus had his
Delia, Lucan his Argentaria,
Horace his Lycinia, Terence
his Leucadia, Propertius
his Hostia, Cornelius
Gallus his Lycoris, and so of
the rest.
Amongst the I^alians,
Dantes had his Beatrix,
Petrarch his Aureta, etc.
And amongst the Spanish
Poets, Crespi Valladaura,

Sezephia Centella, Guid^
Cavalcante, Almudavar,
Bonavida, Lopez del Vigo,
with infinite others, all eminent
Poets: and not one of
them, whose pen was not
imployed in the laborious
encomiasticke of some excellent
Lady or other.
The like I may say of the
Germanes, as Iohannes Gulielmus
Rosbachius, Matthias
Baderus, Lambertu^
Ludolphus, Frenzekius,
Franciscus Modius, Bebel^lius,
etc. Amongst th^
French, Marrot, and others.
And of our English, I will
only, at this time, memorize
two; famous Mr. Edmund

Spencer, magnified in his
Gloriana; and the most renowned
Sr. Philip Sidney,
never to bee forgotten in
his Pamela and Philoclea.
Nay, none of these Satyrists
against women, but
with easie examination, I
could bring their owne
works to witnesse against
themselves; but more needfull
occurrents take mee off
from them: I will therefore
leave them to their contradictions,
with that of Terentius,
in the Prologue to
his first Comedy called
Andraea:
--ut quiescant porro moneo,
and desinantMaledicere, malefacta ne noscant
sua.I warne them their ill speeches
to forbeare,Lest of their owne ill deeds
they further heare.
For it is the fashion of many
to prie, and seeke to have
a deepe inspection to the actions
and behaviours of
others, whilst they are
meerely carelesse and negligent
in managing of
their owne manners and deportment:
which Horace
ingeniously observes, and
with which I conclude this
Chapter:
--Egomet mi ignosco Maevius
inquit,Stultus and improbus hic amor
est, dignusque notari.Maevius doth say, My selfe
on my selfe dote;But foolish is this love, and
worthy note.When purblind thou, thine
own cheeks canst not see,Why dost thou looke so
fixt on him or mee?For now thine eyes so nimble
sighted are,The Eagle or the Serpent
to out-stare.



CHAP. II.

Of virgintie, and the excellencie
thereof. The punishment
of the incestuous
Vestalls. How chastitie
was honoured amongst
the ancient Spartans.
How farre virgins may
extend their words, writings,
or gestures.

BEfore I come to dissect,
or take upon mee to anatomize
the conditions o^ ^wives,
it lieth in my road^
way to speake something of
virgins; for all women
were first maids before they
came to bee married. One

saith of women in generall,
that they are wonders in
nature, if they would not
wrong nature. And another,
that they bee admirable
Angels, if they would
not be drawen with Angels
to become Devils. And of
virgins thus: If they bee
faire, they are to bee won
with praises: and if coy,
with prayers: if they bee
proud, with gifts: if covetous,
with promises. And
as it is naturall in them to
despise what is offered, so
it is death to them to be denied
what they demand.
Some compare their hearts
to the Cotton tree, whose

fruit in the bud is as hard as
a bullet of iron, but being
ripe, it bringeth forth nothing
but soft wooll. But
give me leave a little to deviate,
and leave them for a
page or two, to speake
something of the excellencie
of virginitie it selfe.
Pope Gregorie hath these
words; Quanquam laudationem
virginitatis non suscepi,
expressionem tamen,
etc. Though I have not
undertooke to give virginitie
the due praise, yet I will
afford it some expression*
and first shew you in what
countrey she was bred, and
by what parent begot. If

that be our countrey where
our dwelling is, then is Heaven
the mansion of chastitie.
It hath here a pilgrimage,
there a permanence.
For what is virginall
chastitie, but an integritie
voyd of all contagion?
And whom can we call the
father thereof, but the immaculate
Sonne of God,
whose flesh saw no corruption,
and whose Divinitie
was not sensible of putrefaction?
How great then is
the honour of virginitie,
when our blessed Saviour,
a virgin, came of a virgin?
A virgin the Mother, a virgin
the Sonne, begot of his

Father before all worlds,
borne of his Mother in the
world; the first proceeding
from his eternall goodnes,
that the second might bee
conducible to our everlasting
glorie. So likewise
the holy Mother Church,
his Spouse, is immaculate in
her conception, and yet
fruitfull in her issue, a Virgin
in her chastitie, a Mother
in her children: being
a virgin shee generateth us,
not by the aid of the flesh*
but by the assistance of the
Spirit; not with the throwes
and paines of the womb,
but by the joyes of Angels:
she gives us suck, not with

the milke of the breast, but
the doctrine of the Apostles.
A virgin is the daughter
of Sion, a virgin is
the new Jerusalem, into
which no flesh can enter
that is common or uncleane.
Note but how farre the
name and vertue of virginitie
ex^endeth: for though
amongst those that be married,
the title and honour
se^meth to bee lost, yet
ought we to know that everie
chaste soule, which abstaineth
from things unlawfull
and forbidden, keepeth
it still. For the Church,
which consisteth of young
and old, male and female,

married and unmarried, everie
member thereof is
honoured with that sacred
title, Virgin.
For many causes (saith
Iohannes Episcopus) did the
Saviour of the world chuse
to be borne of a wife espoused
to an husband: first, to
take away all aspersions
that might bee alledged against
her by the Jewes,
who urging the strength of
the Law, would have stoned
her, being the punishment
imposed upon an a^dulteresse:
next, to prevent
all occasions from immodest
virgins, lest they
should listen unto any false

suspitious rumours, by
which our blessed Saviour
might bee injured or defamed:
that in going and returning
from Aegypt, shee
might have the company
and comfort of her husband
Ioseph, not a protectour
onely, but a witnesse of her
continued virginitie; as also
to beguile the Devill, the
open adversarie of all mankinde,
who by reason of her
marriage, might be in some
hesitation and doubt whether
she were a virgin, and
therefore grow diffident
whether our blessed Saviour
were the Sonne of God,
or no.
Pope Leo, Parturiente
Maria, natus est nobis Dei
filius, etc. Mary being delivered,
or bringing forth,
to us and for us was borne
the Sonne of God; borne
of an untoucht woman, that
his humane birth might assure
us that he was perfect
man, and her immaculate
virginitie confirme to us,
that he was perfect God; of
whom Maxinus Episcopus
to this purpose testates.
Though when hee was
borne, earthly swathings
contained him, yet that hee
was not of earth, heavenly
signes witnessed of him.
Whilst he lay in the cradle,

he shined in the clouds; hee
cryed as an infant amidst
the Jewes, he raigned as an
Emperour amongst the
Gentiles: whilst hee suckt
amongst the Bethlemites,
hee was a worshipped^ and
adored by the Chaldeans;
when hee was visited by
Shepherds, he was honoured
by Kings; when he was
obscure in the stable, hee
was visible amidst the
starres. Hee was poore in
habit amongst the Jewes,
he appeared in glory amidst
the Gentiles.
Therefore (saith a learned
Father) let all virgins rejoyce,
for Mary the blessed

virgin hath brought forth;
let all widowes bee glad,
for Anna the widow acknowledged
Christ in his
infancie; let all wives exult,
for when Mary came to visit
Elizabeth, the wife of
Zacharias, the babe sprang
in her womb; let all children
give praise, for Iesus
himselfe hath vouchsafed
to become a child; let all
old men give thanks unto
the Lord, for old Simeon
did not depart the world, till
his bodily eyes had seene
his spirituall salvation: and
this shall suffice for a sheet-discourse,
concerning the
honour and vertue of (neve^

too much to bee praised)
virginitie.
The Romans so honoured
chastitie, that such of
the Vestall virgins, as were
knowne to violate their
strict vowes of virginitie,
were called incestuous
(which word comes of Caestus,
a virginall girdle, never
untyed but on the night
succeeding the day of marriage):
and being convicted
of the fact, their judgement
was to bee buried alive.
They were Votar^sses, sacred
to the Goddesse Vesta,
which implyes as much as
Earth; for Vesta and Earth
are all one: as Ovid Fastor.

lib. 6. with great elegancie
delivereth it in these words:
--Ne viva defodietur
Humo:Sic incesta perit; quia quam
violavit, in illaConditur: and tellus Vestaque
Numen idem est.No Vestall Priest, to break
her vow be said,Lest shee (yet living) in her
tomb be laid:The injur'd Earth, th'Incestuous
must devoure,Because the Earth and Vesta
are one power.
Moreover, their persons
were had in such reverence,
that the people gave them
almost divine adorations,

and the Senatours and Princes
at meeting gave them
way.
Amongst the Lawes that
Lycurgus made, one was,
that no virgin, of what estate
or condition soever,
should have any dowrie allotted
her to her marriage:
and being demanded the
reason thereof, he made answer;
lest those that be rich
should bee desired for their
wealth, or those that want
be despised for their povertie:
so that by marriage, the
Maid and not her meanes,
beautie and vertue would be
acquired solely. He also appointed
at what yeeres either

sex should marrie,
which was at a mature age*
that from able bodies might
be propagated the stronger
issue. Neither would hee
suffer them to bed together
the marriage night, unlesse
by stealth, but to keepe the
Bride-groome and the
Bride (if it were possible)
many nights asunder, by
conference and company:
and being askt the cause
thereof, hee made answer,
Because they should still
prevent satietie, keepe thei^
bodies strong and in health*
which would preserve their
love fresh and new, prevent
distast, and continue indulgence.
Unguents and tinctures
he banished the Citie, imposing
mulcts and fines on
all those who were found
to use them: and in his
dayes, such was the rare
modestie both of their virgins
and matrons, as that adulterie
was so little practised,
that the name thereof
was not knowne amongst
them. For Plutarch in Lacon.
Apotheg. reports, that
a stranger asking one Geradata,
a matron of the old
Spartane race, what punishment
their Lawes inflicted
upon adulterers? She made
answer, Lycurgus had made
none, for there was no such

monster to bee found amongst
them. But hee replying:
but say any such
should be, how then? Why
then (saith she) he must bee
fined to give a Bull with so
long and large a neck, that
shall stretch over the mount
Taygetus, and drinke of
the river Eurota. Which
hearing, he said, that was a
thing impossible. As impossible
a thing (said she)* it
is in Sparta to finde an adulterer
or adulteresse.
Now whether it be lawfull
or comely for a Vestall,
or profest virgin, or any other,
in her single and uncontracted
estate, to bee

pleasant in lookes, free in
language, wanton in carriage,
to poetize, or the like,
(howsoever she be of modest
and chaste condition)
may be any just taxation of
her continence, it is a question
disputable. Seneca in
his controversies, speaketh
of a Vestall virgin, who but
for writing this verse,
Felices nuptae, moriar nisi
nubere dulce est.
was summoned into open
Court, and pleaded against
in these or the like words:
Felices nuptae, .i. happy are
those which be married.
These be the words of one
that longs for marriage,

which the Vestalls ought
not to doe. And Moriar*
.i. may I die but: in whic^
she prefers humour before
honour, and lewdnesse before
life. Nubere dulce est
sweet it is to marrie: whic^
implies she is either raptur'd
with the thought o^
what she hath already proved,
or extasi'd with th^
conceit of that she hath no^
yet tri^d: neither of whic^
pollutions ought to be (...)
one of her profession. Sha^
the magistrates submit th^
maces? the Tribunes the
types of renowne? Sha^
the Consuls and Preto^s
Dictators and Flamins, giv^

way to her in the Forum?
Shall any one of her contagious
humours be held capable
of such canonicall honour?
The Vestall Priests
protest seldome, or (if at
all) by the Goddesse Vesta:
but Let me die: Doth not
this shew that Vesta's living
fiers are now quite extinct
and dead in her? Let me
die but: In these words
proclaimes she not that she
preferres the spotted bed of
the married before the un^efiled
alt^r of the Goddesse?
whom I invoke to
be as rigorous in punishing,
as she hath beene rebellious
in provoking her. Beseemes

it a Recluse to become so
rude? or a Votaresse to
shew her selfe so full of vanitie?
What, a Virgin to
versifie? Shall that hand*
onely reserved to offer (...)
the Temple, now be officious
in penning nothing bu^trifles?
Or if shee have a
mind to write in praise o^
marriage, why makes shee
not chaste Lucrece her
Theme, and her imitable
death her Argument? O
thou worthy of all sever^
punishment, that holde^^
any thing dearer to thee
than thine owne sacred
Priesthood! But to marrie^
thou saist it is pleasant, it is

sweet. How expresly uttered,
how intimately concealed!
as impudently proclaimed, as incontinently
apprehended. Being one
that undoubtedly having
done the act, now most undecently
seemes to delight
in the ill. Nay such a one
as may be truely called Incesta,
who though she never
did the deed, yet in her
heart hath desired it.
This was (I must confesse)
inforced to the full: but in
stead of playing the Advocate,
and shewing what answer
she might make for
her selfe, I will breake off
with this gentle admonition:

If one facetious line, wri^
(perhaps) rather to shew
her wit than any wantonnesse,
and that any charitable
censurer might rathe^
impute it to fancie tha^
follie, might be so traduc^
and farre stretcht, as no^
onely to blemish the fame,
but take away the life of so
respected and reverent a
person as a Vestall; how
charie ought all Virgins to
be? how carefull and cautelous
in all their deport^ments?
to be wary in the^
words, and weighty in their
writings, that their countenances
bewray no lightnesse,
their eyes no loosenesse:

that their carriages
be not complementall, but
courteous: their gestures
not grosse, but gracious:
their language fashionable,
not frivolous: And to
the name of Virgin still remember
to add that best
becomming attribute and
character, Vertue. Observing
these and the like, there
is no doubt but as in your
single estate you live like
excellent maids, so the time
will come when you shall
become eminent Matrons.


CHAP. III.

Encouragements to young
Virgins and Damosells to
behave themselves well in
their single estate, that
they may become eminent
Wives and Matrons, by the
example of others, drawn^
from divers selected Histories.

TO encourage all maides
how to behave themselves,
that they may be the
better married (for as yet
they are not come to the
rudiments of reading a Curtaine
Lecture, for that only
belongs to wives; the very
name whereof will instruct
them soone enough (if not
too soone) in the practice:)

I hold it not impertinent to
the present tractate in hand,
to shew you an history or
two (and those not common)
how some Virgins,
but of meane condition and
quality, have, by their vertues
meerely, and generous
behaviour, attained to great
preferment and honour:
for varietie of Historie, intermixt
with discourse of
times, makes the Argument
lesse tedious to the Reader.
Thus therefore it happened,
Pulgotius the Historian being
my Author, who remembers
me of one Galdrata
Bertha, the daughter
of a private Florentine, but

of extraordinarie beautie
and vertue.
It so happened, that the
Emperour Otho, the fourth
of that name, upon some
urgent occasion comming
to the great Citie of Florence,
he was entertained
with all the sumptuous and
triumphall shewes which
could be then provided, as
best suiting with a State Imperiall.
He being one day abroad
to take the aire, a
great confluence of people
gathered about him, of all
degrees, to behold his person,
whom till then they
had never seene, and to bestow
on him for his welcome

into the Citie, the
lowd acclamation of Ave
Caesar. Amongst all the other
Virgins and Damosels
there assembled, he cast his
eye upon this Galdrata Bertha,
and on the sudden was
much taken with her beautie;
in so much that, not able
to mother his affection
(for he had taken a most
especiall notice of her) after
he had retired himselfe unto
the Dukes Palace, where
he was at that time bounteously
feasted, he began openly
at the table to speake
of this Damosels beautie,
giving her a character of
prioritie before all that he

had before time seene.
Her father, whose name
was Bellincionus, there
attending at the table,
finding by the Emperours
description that there was
no other likelihood but that
it was his daughter of whom
he gave such an extraordinarie
approbation, because
he reflected upon her stature,
feature and habit, sends
for her privately to Court,
and commands her by the
duty of a child, all delayes
set apart, to make there her
present and personall appearance.
To which the innocent
Damosell (ignorant,
and no way suspitious of

any such treason intended
against her chastity, especially
from a father) assented,
and came. The banquet
being ended, and the table
withdrawne, the father
(worse than the Roman
Cabbus or Phuillus, branded
with eternall infamy, who
though honoured with the
stile of Equites Romani, either
for gaine or flattery
were guilty of their wives
prostitution) he (I say) whispered
the Emperour in the
eare, and told him that he
would presently bring him
into the company and acquaintance
of her whose
beauty and feature he had so

liberally extolled. The
Prince gladly imbracing
the motion, he retired him
into a private and remote
chamber, where she was attending
her fathers command;
the Emperour at the
first enterview acknowledging
her to be the same:
when the most unworthy
Parent of so accomplisht a
child, thus said unto him: Lo
here the Virgin by you so
much praised ready to prostrate
her self to your Majesty,
whom you may with all
freenesse kisse and embrace
at your pleasure. At which
words Otho, almost extasi'd,
came toward her to take her

by the hand, and proceeded
further to have toucht her
lips: but she astonisht and
abasht at her fathers unnaturall
levitie and besenesse,
denied the Emperour her
right hand, and with her
left modestly put him back,
uttering these words: With
pardon to your high and sacred
Majesty (Royall Sir)
n^ither of these your faire
proffers it lies in me to grant
you, having made betwixt
my Saviour and my selfe
such an irrevocable vow
and contract, that I will never
lend that hand or these
lips to any, of what state or
condition soever, whom I

shall not undoubtedly know
to be my Lord and Husband:
(at which the father
frown'd) and she further
proceeded and said (falling
low upon her knees, and many
tears dropping from her
eyes) Hee onely insidiates
my life that se^kes to take
away the least part of mine
honour; and there she paused.
Which in the apprehension
of the Emperour
was uttered with such a
bashfull shame, and well-becomming
modesty, that in
the Prince it tooke a very
sudden and solid impression;
who comparing the villanie
of the father with the vertues

of the daughter, and
setting the base Pandarisme
of the one against the rare
prudence of the other, it
compelled him into a divided
and distracted countenance.
For with a stern and
supercelious brow bent against
him, but a smooth
and unwrinkled front applied
unto her, he made this reply,
aiming his speech unto
her: Delicate and sweet
Virgin, are you then already
disposed of? or by private
contract engaged to any
man? To which she with a
low and well-beseeming obedience
answered, that she
had not as yet devoted her

selfe unto any. Will you
then (replied the Emperour)
faire Damosell, give mee
leave to provide you of an
husband? Who answered
unto him, that it might appeare
in her great rudenes and
indiscretion withall, not to
agree to such a motion, and
therefore with all obedi^nce,
submission, and grati^ude,
she surrendred her
selfe wholly to his Highnesse
choise, assuredly presuming
that since he him^elfe
was indued with such
rare continence and vertue,
he could not choose but be
^ble to distinguish the like
in others; holding it a great

felicitie and fortune that a
Prince of his knowne piety
and goodnesse, would be so
gracious as to solicite in that
nature for his so unworthy
and dejected hand-maid.
Which language was delivered
with such discretion
and mod^stie, that Otho was
therewith much taken; when
presently calling for a Gentleman
of especiall remark,
who waited on him in his
chamber, called Guido Germanic^s,
of a no^le House
and Familie, whom hee
much favoured; hee told
him* that he had at length
found out a gift to reward
him, and to remunerate his

long and faithfull service;
such a one as might be^ome
the giver, and (withall) prove
worthy his acceptance: and
in the closure of these words
presented unto him the Virgin
Galdrata Bertha. These
two at the first enterview so
well loved and liked, for as
Ovid saith,
None ever lov'd that lov'd
not at first sight.
that by their mutuall consent
they were in a royall
assembly publikely contracted
by Caesar, who gave
her for her dower that spacious
valley which lieth beneath
the hill Casentius, and

the fields called Agri Aren^in^,
which soone after he
made an Earledome, and
conferred that noble Title
upon him; and from these
two succeeded the famous
and warlike familie of the
Guidons (so renowned in
historie) which hath continued
unto many sucessions.
Paulus Aemilius tells us
that Manesteus the Athenian,
and sonne to Iphicrates
that famous Captaine, took
unto his bed a maid of a forraine
Countrey, but so low
degreed that the historie
affords her not so much as a
name: who though she was

poore in estate, yet was she
rich and aboundantly qualified
both in the riches of
the body and the mind. The
son being demanded which
of his two parents he affected
most, his father or his
mother? he made answer,
that in his fi^iall duty and
affection he gave the precedence
unto his mother. But
he that proposed the question,
knowing the difference
in their birth^ and breeding,
demanding the reason thereof,
he gave him this satisfaction;
True it is (saith he)
that m^ (...) her h^th made
me an Ally and Countriman
of Thrace, but my mother

hath made me an Athenian,
and the son of a noble Captaine.
Bersane was the daughter
of one Arbassus a private
souldier in the Camp of Alexander,
who, as Quint.
Curtius, and Aul. Gelli^^, affi^me,
was of sweet grace,
and amiable aspect, that like
the Sunne appearing out of
a cloud, so out of the darknesse
of her neglected fortune
there shone such a majesticall
lustre, that he who
was then the worlds sole
Monarch, preferred her before
the wife a^d beautifull
daughters of Darius, whom
he had late vanquished: in

so much that it is related of
him by the forenamed Authors,
that after his first familiaritie
with her he was
never knowne to cast an incontinent
looke upon any other,
nor to have congresse
with any third, onely his
wife Roxana, and this Bersane,
whom he commended
to his Queene, and made her
his ^ole companion.
It is likewise reported of
the famous Rhodope, that
she was at the first but servant
to Iadmonsamius the
Philosopher, yet by her amiable
feature and dexterous
carriage she afterwards was
advanced to such honour as

to be wife unto Psammeticus
King of Egypt.
Lardana, from whom
the renowned family of the
Heraclidae boast their descent,
was a Damosell of a
very low and meane parentage,
and indeed no better
than an hand-maid and servant,
yet by her rare and unmatchable
vertue she after
raised her fortunes to the eminence
to be a fruitfull seminarie
of many noble and
renowned Gentlemen; for
so Herodotus witn^sseth of
her in his Eutarpe.
Pysostrates, as Phelarchus
historifies, matcht himselfe
with a Virgin of rare beauty,

but her birth so obscure
and ignoble, that the stori^
affordeth it no name; yet
after, she by her wisdome
and counsell adv^nced him
from being a Gentleman of
private condition, to a Monarchall
government. Of
her Clademus in his book^
intituled Redd^tionum, reports,
that she was for sta^e
a Iuno, for wisedome a Pallas,
for beauty a Venus, and
worthy to be stiled the
daughter of Sacrates. It is
moreover said of her, tha^
she dealt Scepters, and disposed
Crowns at her pleasure;
so great was her power
in the place in which she
governed.
I will end with Asputia
the daughter of one Hermotinus
a man of low condition
(as Aelianus the approved
Histo^iographer in
his book De varia Historia
relates) who being snatcht
from the armes of her father
by a Persian souldier,
was for the excellency of
her feature and beauty, by
him presented to King Cyrus
the son of Darius and
Parasatides. Her vertuous
education, unmatchable
beauty, singular modestie,
and approved wisedome,
were the immediate steps
to purchase her such favour
with the Persian Monarch,

that he not only made her
his Empresse, but so tenderly
aff^cted her, that notwithstanding
his choice of
wives, and multiplicity of
concubines, from the first
houre that she grew into his
knowledge and acquaintance
he never embrac'd the
company of any other woman.
And after the death of
Cyrus, whose funeralls she
bewailed with unspeakable
sorrow, being afterward as
highly favoured by Artaxerxes
who succeeded
him in the Empire, who desired
to make her a partner
in his bed and Throne; yet
was it with long suit from

him, and great unwi^lingnesse
in her, before she could
be won to participate in either
of them.
And these out of infinite
I have collected onely to
shew unto you that Virgins,
howsoever obscurely descended,
who from their
Ancestours could neither
boast of wealth or Gentrie,
yet by their vertues, beauty,
and generous behaviour,
have not only attained unto
matches of most especiall
remarke, but some also to
dignities imperiall.
Famous unto all ages, even
to the perpetuitie of
memory, shall be that great

Arch-champion of virginitie,
Virginius, that brave
Roman knight, whose name
was given him in his childhood
as a good omen, presaging
what a defender of chastity
he would after prove
who because his sole and
only daughter. Virgini^
should not fall into th^
hands of Appius Claudius
one of the Decemviri, to b^
vitiated and dishonoured
when he perceived by th^
corruptnesse of the Judge
and the perfidiousnesse (...)
the false evidence, that (...)
was ready to fall and suffe^
under his cruell mercy, (...)
the open face of the (...)

at the barre at which
her cause was then pleaded,
^e ^lew her with his owne
hands, so vindicate her inno^ence;
desirous rather (as
Valerius reports of him) of
^n innocuous child to be the
deaths-man, than the father
of a defiled daughter: of
whom Silius Italicus l. 13.
Bel. Punico thus speakes:
--Virginia juxta
Cerne, cruentato vulnus sub
pectore servat.Behold before thee where
Virginia's plac't,Her white breast with a
griefly wound defac't.The bloudie knife doth witnesse
the sad stroke,Which freed her body from
lusts servile yoke:Whose modest innocence
so farre extends,Her fathers act she in her
death commends.


CHAP. IV.

Of election or choice before
marriage. The conveniences
and inconveniences
belonging unto marriage
disputed, and compare^
with the honour and dignity
thereof.

BEfore I come to wedlocke
it selfe, it is very

pertinent that I speak something
of choice before marriage.
Saith one, Liber esse non
potest cui affectus imperant,
and cupiditates domi^nantur:
he cannot be truely
said to have a free choice
and election, in whom his
affections rule, and his appetites
governe. The Queene
Artemisia being asked by
one of her Nobility what
choice should be used in
love? replied, All persons
ought to imitate the skilfull
Lapidaries, who measure
not the nature of the gem
by the outward hew, but
the inward vertue. We have
an old Adage frequent amongst

us, which for the
most part proveth true, that
choice is soonest deceived in
three things; namely, in
Brokers wares, Courtiers
promises, and Womens constancies:
therefore it is
good for all men to looke
before they leap; for it is
generally found,
Qui non ante cavet, istePassus erit quod sit triste.That man deserves of ^orrow double share,Who once forwarn'd, will after not beware.
In choosing a wife, looke
not upon the feature of the

body, but search into the
fancies of her mind; and
take her not for her outward
person, but her inward
perfection. For if
thou makest election of
beauty, it fadeth; if of riches,
they soone waste; if of
fame, it oft proves false; if
of vertue, that only continues.
For as Theopompus
tells us, If the eye be the
chuser, the delight is short;
if the will, the end is want;
but if reason, the effect is
happy. And Bias, one of
the Grecian Sages, was
wont to say, that he that
marrieth himselfe to a faire
face, oftentimes tieth himselfe

to a foule bargaine.
But there are some that
scarce will admit of any
choice at all, and say, Who
that is free will willingly
run into fetters like a foole?
For whosoever maketh
himselfe a Captive without
constraint, incurreth the
imputation either to bee
counted wilfull or witlesse:
and amongst such, one deeply
entire unto me, who was
in a great hesitation whether
to marry or no, shewed
me a fancy of his written to
that purpose, which was as
followeth:
What kind of wife were I
best wed? A maide?Shee's young perhaps, and
knowes not how to trade.A widow? Who stale leavings
can endure?One old? Thou of a crabbed
match art sure?One fruitfull? Numerous
issue will aske cost.One barren? Youth and
strength in vain are lost.One rich? Shee'll domineer,
and master prove.One poore? Whom want
oppresseth who can love?One mute? Her tongue will
not delight mine ^are.A prater? That's a burden I
most feare.One faire? Such aptest are
to be mis-led.One foule? Shee's tedious
both to board and bed.No marriage then, Ile keep
my single state,Since on a wife so many dangers
wait.But if heaven will that I ^
Consort have,O grant me one that's pious,
wise, and grave.
So much for choice: I
come now to discourse of
marriage it selfe, and the inconveniences
and conveniences
thereof. For though
Diogenes the Cynick Philosopher
was of opinion, that
for a young man to marrie
it was ever too soone, and

for an old man alwaies too
late; and Euripides the Tragick
Poet calls it an evill,
yet to be desired; and that
S^obaeus saith, a woman
bringeth but two joyfull
daies only in her whole life
time, which are, the day of
her marriage, and the day of
her death; and that Thales
seeing Solon lament the
death of his son, gave him
no other comfort than this,
that for the like reason only
he had refused to marrie;
and that Cleobulus meeting
his son in the way, having
finished the nuptiall ceremonie,
presented him with
a branch of Hen-bane;

thereby intimating, that his
sweet meat must be served
in with sower sawce, and a
terrible tempest was to succeed
so temperate a calme:
yet we reade on the contrary
part, that Lycurgus the
famous Law-giver branded
all such with infamy as refused
to marrie. And the Caspians
made an edict, that
whosoever past their yeeres
singly, and did not contract
matrimony before they
came to fifty, in all feasts
and assemblies such should
have the lowest and most
dishonourable places allotted
them, as those who had
neglected their prime and

most flourishing time of
their age, and done a thing
meerely repugnant to nature.
Homer tells us that the
Grecian Ladies in his daies
held wedlocke in such adoration,
as they reckoned
their yeeres from their marriage,
not their birth: and
we Christians hold, that our
spirituall marriage is contracted
in baptisme, confirmed
in godly life, and consummated
in a repentant
death. Now concerning
whether it be necessitous or
no, it may be thus disputed:
Matrimony is therefore

to be esteemed and honoured,
as being first ordained
in Paradise, and since continued
upon earth, and in a pious
gratitude returnes us
many pious and gracious
children, to be made Citizens
and Saints in heaven.
It purchaseth man the name
of father here below, as a
type of that great and Almighty
Father above: here
generating, as he there creating.
God made nature,
man here maintaines her:
and to such things as else
would perish by time (by
his posterity) he giveth perpetuity.
Marriage puts fortitude
into man, to fight

boldly in the defence of his
King and his Countrey.
For who can be a coward,
fearing his wife and children
may be made captives? It
maketh men wise, as carefull
to provide for them: it begets
temperance, and out of
voluptuousnesse breedeth
modesty: for it limiteth
lust within law, and prescribeth
a moderation to pleasure,
which in it selfe being
damnable, is by matrimony
made ^ufferable.
Now if some shall object
and say, Though marriage
with peace may be called
the worlds Paradise, yet if
it be with shrife, it may be

termed the lives Purgatory;
and that all such as marry
in haste may repent at
leisure: and some to the like
purpose, may quote Terence
in Adelphis, in these
words:
Duxi uxorem, quam ibi non
miseriam vidi? etc.What have I got by marriing
of a wife,But misery to attend me all
my life?Children I have, and that's
another care:The charge to keepe them
makes me poore and bare.In toile and travell all my
time I spend,But of my tedious labour
there's no end.Now I am old, and for my
age thus spent,What's my reward, but
hate and discontent?
Many no doubt have for
these and the like feares bin
affraid, and forborne to marrie
at all, thinking with
Plautus, that he who desires
to intangle and intricate
himselfe into a world
of troubles, may provide
himselfe of a ship to guide,
or a wife to governe. Another
will say, he that taketh
one who is faire and
false, weddeth himselfe unto

a world of miseries; or if
to one as vertuous as beautifull,
yet in possessing a woman
he at the best enjoyeth
but a needfull evill. To such
it may be thus answered,
that in this they rather accuse
fortune than wedlock;
for all things that happen
crosse and averse, are the effects
of chance, not of matrimony.
Much better it is
therefore carefully to respect
those good things thereon
necessarily depending, than
timerously to regard the
disasters accidentally reflecting.
Admit the worst that
can be objected, yet is not
marriage therefore to be

neglected; for if in all other
courses and passages of our
life we be crost, shall we
therefore be altogether deterr'd
from prosecuting
them, as things accurst?
Examine all trades, faculties,
disciplines, or professions:
(to instance some few
in behalfe of the rest) what
practise is it, though the
most necessitous and usefull,
which may not be cavill'd
at, or that we cannot find
some colour to accuse? The
Husbandman, though the
frost prove violent, the
snow unseasonable, the
showers intempestive or
immoderate, yet doth he

not therefore forsake his
fields, cease his culture,
and despaire of an happie
harvest.
The Mariner having endured
many stormes at Sea,
in which his goods have
been hazzarded, and his life
endangered, doth not instantly
upon his landing untackle
his ship, and having
brought her from the water,
break her up to the fire;
but rather proposeth to
himselfe those many benefits
which may arise by navigation:
as that no profit
can be made without perill,
and no delightfull gaine but
with some great difficultie:

^ee considereth, that the
temperature of weather
succeedeth tempests; that
wealth commeth not by
wishing, but watching: neither
can rest in age be procured,
where labour and industry
in youth is not practised.
Warres take away the
limbs and lives of many, yet
doth not that terrifie others
from the attaining unto
honour by armes: and ^o
of the rest. Good things
are not to be forborne for
the feare of evills that may
ensue, rather the worst
things are to be endured,
that the better may bee

encouraged. Were it not
then absurd that Husbandmen,
Navigators, and Souldiers,
shall not fo^beare to
use all diligence and exercise
in their severall qualities?
(as no way deterr'd by the
detriments belonging unto
them) and shall any man
forbeare ma^riage for the
multiplicitie of cares and
crosses which some (through
their vaine and idle feares)
would asperse upon it?
Shall a Virgin feare to
marrie onely with this evasion,
Say I should be a widow;
or having children
borne, O what a griefe it
would be to me to see them

buried? Let her know that
in this case death is to be
blamed, not matrimonie;
and she may as well accuse
nature for making us men,
and not Gods. If either husband
or children die, it is because
they were borne, and
their bodies created mortall,
and not immortall.
It may be therefore thus
further argued, that marriage
supplies such deficiencie
in nature: for by a second
nuptiall the wife loseth the
name of widow, and redeemeth
not only the late lost
name of husband, but to her
children the forfeited name
of father: by which marriage

maketh amends in what nature
seemed to doe amisse,
and is rather a restauration
than a deprivation to Orphancie
and Widow-hood.
If you shall summe up the
cares and troubles that depend
upon wedlocke, set but
against them the profits and
the pleasures, and they shall
farre surmount them both
in nature and number. What
greater content to a man,
than after the laborious travells
of the day to repose at
night in the bosome of a
sweet and loving bed-fellow?
What more delightfull
hope than the exectation
of an happy issue? The

throwes of the mother are
forgot in the birth of the
child, and the pleasures of
the latter farre surmount the
paines of the former: the
peevishnesse of the childs
infancie is quite forgot
when he begins to prattle.
What comfort their toward
youth breeds, and what
consolation their more staid
yeeres beget, I leave to their
consideration who have
beene the fruitfull parents
of a fortunate progenie.
If then by lawfull marriage
soules are here inspired
upon earth to become glorious
Saints in heaven, and
parents (in their issue and

succession) imitate the Creator
himselfe, by giving life
to others, that they by an
alternate course, as they receive
breath from their fathers,
may also returne it to
their own children (and so
till the last dissolution): if it
change the common titles
of man and woman to the
honoured names of father
and mother; if it beget temperance,
providence, and
the rest, and make these carnall
pleasures, which are otherwise
interdicted and
forbidden, honest and legitimate;
if the certaine comforts
so farre surmount all
casuall corsives, as it is so

graciously honoured, why
should it not be gen^rally
embraced? And though
Saint Ambrose saith, Nuptiae
terras implent, virginitas
Paradi^um; marriage peoples
the earth, but virginity
Paradise; yet Saint Austine
preferres humble marriage
before proud virginity. I
conclude this Chapter with
that of Claudian in Europa.

Nascitur ad fructum mulier
prolemque futuram.


A woman was made fruitfull
in her birth,
Still to continue mankind
upon earth.




CHAP. V.

How parents ought to dispose
of their daughters. The
miseries of enforced contracts.
The maner of marriage
amongst the Romans,
the Muscovites, the
ancient Britans, the
Gaules, the Germans, etc.

PLato in his booke De
Legib. tells us, that mankind
is by marriage made
immortall, and lasteth for
ever: for by leaving children
to beget children, the
father by successive genera^ion
is made immortall: of

which immorta^itie all such
are justly deprived, who abandon
themselves to a life
single and solitary. But
there ought to be a great
care in the Parents in disposing
of their children, the
better to continue this blessed
perpetuitie. The Emperour
Aurelius informeth us,
that there was a custome amongst
the Rhodians, or a
Proverb at least, that the
fathers to marry a son need
to spend but one day, but in
the disposing of one daughter
they ought to consider
with themselves ten yeers:
which were it even in these
times carefully observed,

and diligently imitated,
might be the prevention of
many inconveniences, or rather
palpable mischiefes, of
which we have had many
wofull examples.
Some through their base
avarice, not willing to allow
unto their daughters sufficient
dowers. Others (too
prodigall) have stretcht
themselves beyond their ability
and meanes, to be the
ruine of their children by
pride, and of themselves by
poverty. Others (ill advised,
or too selfe-opinioned)
by their too much dotage
on the sons have cast too
great a neglect upon the

daughters; by which, as
they lose time, so they forfeit
duty, and many times
chastity: for when they
come to maturity of yeers,
such as their fathers have no
care to bestow, have a will
to dispose of themselves;
the event of which is for
the most part disaster and
penurie. Others will enforce
them to marry where
themselves like, and not
where their children love;
the effects of which are
commonly discontent and
misery (for inequality either
in yeeres, fortunes, or
affections, is the road way
to spouse-breach and didivorce:

for where there is
dis-union of hearts, there
must needs be disorders in
the house.
How often have forced
contracts beene made to
add land to land, not love to
love? and to unite houses
to houses, not hearts to
hearts? which hath beene
the occasion that men have
turned monsters, and women
devills. I forbeare to
instance any, for in nomination
of the dead I might
perhaps give distast to such
of the kinred who yet survive,
who no question could
rather with that the memory
thereof were rather buried

than blazed abroad. Further,
who shall but follow
the Circuit in the Countrey,
besides these trialls
here in the City, shall seldome
find a generall Assises
without some evidence or
other giv^^ upon the like
tragicall accidents. But leaving
these, I purpose in the
next place to speake something
concerning the ancient
ceremonies observed amongst
the Romans, and others,
in their contracts and
nuptiall ceremonies.
The Romans called them
Sponsalia, a spondendo, of
the vow and promise made
each to other; which words

were writ downe, recorded,
and sealed before witnesses,
and those were called Signatores.
Before the ceremony,
the Bride and Bridegroome
consulted severally
either of them with a soothsayer,
to know what omen
should be in their future
marriage. Of which Iuvenal
in his tenth Satyr maketh
mention:
--Veniet cum signatoribu^
auspex.
.i. The Soothsayer comes
with those that signed to
the contract. Aul. Gellius
informes us that the young
man gave unto the Virgin a

ring, which she ware upon
her fourth finger on the left
hand, because to that finger
alone (as the best Anatomists
tell us) proceeds a
veine that hath its originall
from the heart. The word
nuptiae is derived from nubo,
which signifieth to cover:
and Plinie sai^h, that
the woman was presented
unto her husband in a yellow
vaile, which was called
Flamineum (which colour is
held to be the embleme of
jealousie) and with that she
covered her face. And in
regard of the good successe
which Romulus and his
souldiers had in their rape

of the Sabine Virgins, they
still continued a custome,
that the Bride-groome
should snatch away the
Bride from the lap or bosome
of her father, mother,
or the next of their alliance
and kinred: and after this
s^eming violence, her husband
was to part or divide
the haire of her head with
the point or top of a speare,
with which some Gladiator
or Fencer had before beene
slaine, and that was called
Hasta caelibaris. T^e morall
whereof (as the Author
informeth me) was, that nothing
but such a lance or
speare, or such like violence,

should after dis-joine them.
Plutarch in Roman. Quaestion.
87. demands why the
Brides haire from the upper
part of the forehead to
the crowne was separated
with such a lance or speare?
Was this (saith he) a symbole
or embleme that the
Romans first marriages were
made by war and rape? Or
is this admonition to the
Brides, that they being married
unto a wa^like people,
should therefore u^e moderation
both in their habit
and diet? Or (as Lycurg^s
commanded) that all the
gates and portalls of their
houses should (without

other curiosity) be only figured
with the sawe and the
axe, to signifie that nothing
vaine or superfluous should
enter in at those doores?
Or doth it imply (by circumstance)
that wedlocke
ought not to be dis-joined
but by sword and death?
Or is it because the speare is
consecrate to Iuno, who is
also called Pronuba, that
is, the Goddesse of marriage,
all her statues being
pourtrayed leaning upon a
lance or javelin? and that
she is called Dea quiritis?
and that a speare was anciently
called quiris? whence
Mars tooke his denomination

of Quirinus, etc.
The next day after the
nuptialls was a feast held, to
which all their friends and
kinred were invited, and
such they called Repotia:
their Aruspices or Witches
conjectured of their future
good or evill by a
Crow, because such is the
consociety of those birds,
that if one of the matched
couple perish by accident,
the other remaines widowed
and singular ever after.
There were then severall
waies by which a Virgin
became a mans lawfull wife:
The first was called (...), that

is, by prescription, that is,
if she were contracted by
her Parents or Overseers,
and continued with her
husband the space of three
entire yeeres, without being
absent from him three
whole nights in a twelve
moneth. The second was,
Confarreatione, which imports,
that when being married
before a Flamine or
chiefe Priest, before ten
witnesses, the married couple
eat together of a barlie
cake, before used in the sacrifice,
which was called
a Far, and the solemnities
(as Cicero pro Muraena averres)
were called Farracea,

from barley. The third
was, Coemptione, of buying
and selling: for the wife
bought her husband, under
a seeming pretence, with a
small piece of silver. Suetonius
speakes of a fourth,
which is titled, Sortitione,
which was by lot or lottery.
But in the former, which
is called Coemptione, where,
by the ancient Roman
lawes,
Nubentes mulieres tres ad
virum asses ferre solebant.
when the women that were
to bee married brought
three small pieces of money

to the Bridegroome, the
man was not called by his
owne name, nor the woman
by hers, but he Caius, and
she Ca^a, in remembrance
of the most excellent and
vertuous Matron Caia Caecilia,
wife to Tarquinius
Priscus. Then the new made
Spouse being brought home
by her friends to the very
doores of her husbands
house, she was to say, Ubi t^
Caius? Hic sum ego Caia:
which Erasmus thus interpreteth,
Ut tu Dominus, ita
ego Domina: .i. as thou art
Master, so am I Mistresse*
and she that was thus married
might justly challenge

the title of Mater familias,
or, Mother of the houshold.
The Bride was lighted thither
with five torches burning,
which did intimate the
great necessitie that married
wives have of these five
gods and goddesses, Iupiter,
Iuno, Venus, Suadela,
and Diana, otherwise called
Lucina.
There were no contracts
held to prove successefull
amongst the Romans which
were not celebrated with
the two elements of Fire
and Water. It is in one of
Plutarchs Roman questions,
What is the reason
(saith he) that in all nuptials

the Bride is commanded to
touch Fire and Water? Is
it because the Fire is an active
Element, and therefore
representeth the man;
and the water a passive, and
consequently an Embleme
of the woman? Or is it because
the Fire illustrates, and
the water purgeth: therefore
the wife ought by all
her endevours and industry
to preserve her purity and
chastity? Or is it because
that as Fire without humour
to feed loseth its fury,
^nd abateth its strength; and
water without some heat
groweth use-lesse and without
motion: so man and woman,

separated and dis-joined,
are of no validity and
power, but by conjunction
or commixtion of their severall
faculties, they by offices
belonging unto marriage
are made compleat and perfect?
Or doth the morall
extend so farre, that the one
ought not to forsake the other,
but to endure prosperity
and adversity alike,
though they be driven to
that extremity that they
have no other good thing
left them save only Fire and
Water to comfort them?
According to that of Seneca
the Tragedian, Amor perennis
Conjugis castae manet: .i.

The love of a chaste wife
lasteth for ever. Or as Ovid
writ in his exile unto
his wise in these words,
Nil opus est morte pro me, sed
amore fideque,Non ex difficili fama petenda
tibi est.Die not for me, no such
thing I desire:Thy love and faith shall
make thy fame aspire.
But to proceed with the
Roman Ceremonies: Servius
super Aeneid. observeth,
that when the woman
was brought to the doore
of the Bride-chamber, she

annointed the posts with
oile, and was called uxor,
quasi unxor, ab unguendo:
this done, the husband took
her in his armes, and lifted
her over the threshold with
a seeming violence, because
(in modesty) she should not
be thought to goe willingly
without some force unto
the place where she should
unloose her Caestus or Virgin
girdle. At her comming
in, all the company present
called with a lowd voice,
Talassio, Talassio: the reason
of which clamour Plutarch
renders us in vita
P^mp. as also in his 31. Roman
question, to this purpose:
In that great rape which
the souldiers of Romulus
committed upon the Sabine
Virgins, one of the fairest
among them being catcht up
by one of the meanest souldiers,
some of the rest, envying
his good fortune, would
have taken her away from
him by force; which he perceiving,
cried out, Talassius,
and that he was bearing her
to Talassius, who was then
a prime young Gentleman
of the Army, and of great
remarke amongst the Romans:
by which clamour he
was suffered to convey her
privately unto him. Since
which time they have observed

in all their marriages
to use the name of Talassius,
as in all the Grecian nuptialls
they sing Hymen, Hymenaee.
Many other superstitions
they have used, which
might seem tedious here to
relate, as their Nuptialia dona,
.i. Their marriage gifts
and tokens, the bed in which
they reposed the first night
being called Lectus genialis,
or (as some will have it) Lectus
genitalis. And if at any
time these were at difference
or dissention betwixt
themselves, they repaired
to a Temple or Chappell
erected to the honour of a

certaine goddesse called Dea
viriplaca, as much as to say,
the goddesse pleaseman;
where when they had staid
a while, and offered such
oblations as were by the
Flamines appointed to that
purpose, all their jarres as
they were before debated,
so they were then and there
ended, and they departed
thence well satisfied and reconciled.



CHAP. VI.

How marriage is solemnized
amongst the Russians, the
Gaules, the Assyrians, the
Greekes, the Namasanes,
the Sco^s, etc. The honour
of marriage, and of
twelve impediments that
may hinder is.

THe maner of solemnizing
Marriage amongst
the Russians or people of
Muscovie is different from
other nations: for the man,
though he never in his life
time beheld the woman,
yet is he not permitted to
have any or the least view

of her when he would solicite
her for marriage, but it
is done by his mother or
next kinswoman: and when
the match is agreed upon, as
well by the Parents as the
parties, (for without the
consent of the Parents no
marriage is held amongst
them lawfull) the father
and chiefe friends meet together
and conclude about
the dower. It is to be observed,
that the Virgin
brings the dower, but the
young man maketh her no
jointure unlesse she have issue
by him, and then shee
hath full interest in his estate.
And if she were never
married before, the Parents
and friends enter into bond
that she shall prove a Virgin.
The contract thus concluded,
they send tokens the
one to the other, but enterchange
no lookes all this
while. The Eeve before the
nuptiall day, the Bride is carried
either in a Callimago
or Coach, or if it be winter,
on a sledd (by reason of
the snow and ice) to the
house of the Bride-groome,
with her wedding clothes,
and the bed on which they
are that night to lie, which
for the most part is very
rich and costly. That night

she is accompanied with her
mother and her other
friends, but all this while of
him not seene. The next day
she is married in a vaile, or
rather an hood of knit^
wo^ke or lawne, which covereth
her from the Crown
of the head to the waste.
They and their friends ride
all to Church, being well
mounted, though never so
neere the place, and though
they be people of the meanest
quality amongst them.
The words and contract, with
the ceremonies, as the Ring,
etc. are almost one with
ours: and the nuptiall knot
being knit by the Priest, th^

Bride comes to her husband
there standing by the Altar,
and bowes her selfe as low
as to his foot, in signe of future
obedience: in requitall
of which, the Bride-groome
casteth his upper garment
over her, as a token or promise
that he will from that
time forward shield and protect
her.
To these two standing
together, come the father
and the next alli'd unto the
woman, and bowe themselves
to the Bride-groom,
and his father and friends
doe the like to her, as a tie
and union of love and affinity
betwixt the two kinreds

and families: to bind which
there is a loafe of bre^d presented
to the Priest, who
breaketh it, and distributeth
it amongst them, of which
they all eat, and protest
withall, that they are all a^
one loafe made of so many
severall graines, or as so many
guests invited to one table.
This ceremonie ended,
the husband takes the
wise by the hand, and leadeth
her to the Church
porch, (their fathers and
friends following them)
where they are met by others,
who present them
with bowles and cups of
severall fashions and siz^^,

fill'd with Meade and Russwine,
whereof the Bride-groome
first takes a Chark
or Chalice in his hand, and
drinkes to the Bride; who
opening her hood or vaile
below (yet so that her face
is still unseene) she pledgeth
him: this done, they part at
the Church doore, he goeth
to his fathers house, and
she to hers, where they entertaine
their friends apart.
At the entring into which
houses, corne is cast upon
them from the upper windowes,
in token of fertilitie
and plentie ever after to attend
them. The evening

come, the Bride is conducted
to her husbands fathers
house, and there
lodged that night, her vaile
still covering her head. Besides,
she is injoin'd from her
mother and other Matrons
her friends, not to speake
one word, because the husband
is neither to see her
face, nor heare her tongue,
till the next morrow after
their marriage; neither is
she that day to speake at all,
saving some few limited
words, meerely of forme,
nor three dayes after. If
she transgresse the least of
these ceremonies, it is a great
dis-reputation to her all her

whole life after.
The third day expired,
they depart unto their own
house, which is by this time
sufficiently accommodated.
And herein is to be observed,
that for the marriage day,
and the whole time that the
nuptiall feast is solemnized,
he hath the honour to be
called Molodax Knez, that
is, young Duke; and shee
Molodax Knezay, the young
Dutchesse.
Iulius Caesar in the 6. book
of his Commentaries tells
us, that amongst the ancient
Gaules (which is now the
French nation) the husband
brought so much goods, and

laid it down, as did amoun^
to the dower which his
wife brought with her,
and a just account being taken,
the stocke was put together,
the party surviving
being made full Executour,
and possessing both their
meanes to them and their
children.
Cornelius Tacitus gives a
noble commendation of the
Germans. The wife, saith
he, never bringeth or assureth
any dower to her husband,
but he to his wife, the
Parents, cousins, and friends
being present to approve or
dislike of all such passages
as are betweene them: neither

is there any enterchange
of love-tokens, intending
to delicacie, or to
corrupt the chastity of the
woman; but his present is
a couple of Oxen yoaked,
an horse bridled and completely
furnished, with a
Sword, Buckl^r, or Target,
and a Javelin: neither doth
she enterchangeably present
him with any gift, save some
weapons, either of offence
or defence. And that
the wife may not thinke her
selfe exempted from the
^ares, travells, and dangers
that the husband may either
by his industry at
home, or valour abroad incurre,

these yoaked cattle,
the Horse, and weapons of
warre, are a remembrance
unto her.
There are very few
knowne adulteries committed
amongst that great and
populous Nation, for the
punishment thereof is very
severe and speedy. For she
that shall be found guilty of
such an act, her husband
causeth her to be sh^ven, and
then stript naked, and after
brings her out of his owne
doores in the presence of all
his and her neerest kinred,
then beats her with a battoone
through the streets:
for there is no connivence

to be used, or pardon to be
granted to any woman who
hath once violated her wedlocke
chastity: neither can
her youth, beauty, or riches,
though all should meet together
in one, ever purchase
her to have the honour of a
second husband; so odible
and detestable is that sinne
held amongst them.
The Assyrians take their
daughters with them (when
they be marriageable) to the
market, and there such as
want wives buy them for
their money, or money-worth.
The like is in custome
with the Babylonians,
and people of Thrace: so

did the ancient Grecians
purchase their wives, either
for coine, or some other
commodity that was vendible.
The like the Indians
in many places observe.
Iphidanas the son of Antenor,
according to Homer,
gave fifty yo^ke of Oxen to
his father-in-law to enjoy
his daughter in marriage. In
Tapila a great Citie in India,
situate betwixt the two Rivers
of Indus and Hydaspes,
they entertain no wives into
their conjugall embraces
which they buy not at some
price. Strabo in his booke
of Geography, lib. 15. informes
us, that in some

Countries, as Carthage and
others, there was a custome,
that if a poore mans daughter
by reason of her poverty
could not compasse a husband,
she was brought to a
publike faire or market,
with trumpets and lowd
musicke before her, and
when a great confluence of
people was gathered about
her, first h^r backe parts
were discovered bare as
high as to her shoulders
from her heele, and then the
like before; and if upon
that view she were found to
be well featured, and no way
defective, at the charge of
the City she was to be provided

of a husband.
Plato in his sixt booke de
Legib. writes, lest any man
should be deceived in the
choice of his Bride, and so
after repent himselfe when
it is too late, that it was
thought convenient, that
divers assemblies of young
men and maids should be
permitted to wrestle, and
^rie masteries together, having
their bodies naked
from the neck to the waste,
as farre as modesty would
give leave. But St. Ierome
against Iovinian condemneth
this wanton and lascivious
custome, and so doth
Clemens Alexandrinus, pedag.

lib. 2. cap. 9. and St. Cyprian
in his booke De Virgin.
habit. in these words,
The honour and bashfull
shame of the body are both
preserved in the modest coverture
of the garment. And
Blandus supra leges interposit.
cap. 1. writeth, that the
very feare of shame, without
the terrour of death or
torment, is sufficient of it
selfe to put off a contract.
The Namasanes, a people
of Lybia (as Herodo^u^
informes us) had a strange
custome, to cause the Bride
the first night of her nuptialls
to prostitute her selfe to
all her guests, and then she

was injoined to preserve her
chastity for ever after. The
Anthropophagi, the Medes,
and some part of the Aethiopians,
after they be once
married, are admitted free
congresse with their mothers
and sisters. The Arabs
make their wives common
to all the kinred. The
Moores, Numidians, Persians,
Parthians, Garamantes,
the Turkes, and some
Jewes, take as many wives
as they can well maintaine:
and the ancient Athenians
made their wives and
daughters common.
It was once a custome i^
Scotland, that the Lord of

the soile might lay just
clai^e and title to every
Virgins maidenhead, who
was to bee married within
his Lordship. For by that
custome the Tenant held his
land; which was after quite
abolished by King Malcoline,
who ordained that the
new married couple should
redeeme her virginitie, in
which her Landlord pretended
interest, with a small
piece of gold, which in
many places of the Kingdome
is observed even untill
this day.
A young man of Lacedemon,
being seated in the
Theater, when a valiant

and ancient Captaine (a
single man and Batchelour)
but for his valour and famous
atchievements much
honoured by his Nation,
came to take his place, to be
a spectator of the sports and
games there presented; hee
denyed to give him place:
at which Callidus, for so was
the Captaine called, much
offended at the arrogance of
his youth, gave him course
and bitter languag^: to
whom he returned this short
answer, Thou hast (O great
Captaine Callidus) as yet fathered
no child, neither accasioned
the birth of any,
who comming unto my

age, may when I am come
unto thine, in this place arise
to do me a like honour.
Plato also in his booke of
Lawes, appointed single
men no place of dignity in
the common-weale, nor suffered
any to bee conferred
upon them; but caused them
to bee more charged with
fines and amerciaments than
any of the other married
Citizens. Socrates professeth
of himselfe, to have learnt
more morall philosophy
from women, than naturall,
of which he made excellent
use.
In marriage there is a domesticke
Common-weale,

in which the Father of the
family may expresse wisedome,
temperance, justice,
pietie, and all other vertues:
by loving his wife, instructing
his children, governing
his familie, ordering
his affaires, disposing his
goods.
The Romans in the yeere
that Quintus Me^ellus was
Consull, established many
famous and worthy Lawes
and priviledges, to incourage
people to marry, and
especially, unto those who
had numerous issue, and
great increase of children:
for without wedlock all alliance
would be extinct, all

Common-weales in short
time decay, and all sweet societie
be quite abandoned.
There bee twelve impediments
to hinder lawfull
marriage, or to dis-annull it
after it be once consummated,
which Cardinall Caj^tanus
comprehends in these
foure verses:
Error, conditio, votum, cognatio,
crimen,Cul^us disparitas, vis, ord^,
ligamen, honesta^:Si sis affinis, si forte c^ire
nequibis,Haec socianda vetant conubia,
facta ^etracta^^.
Thus paraphrased.
Errour, condition, parentage,
and vow,
Adultery (the law will not
allow
Disparitie in divine worship)
and
Violence or force, or where
we understand;
In priesthood; there's profanenesse,
or else where,
False faiths profest, wee
likewise must forbeare,
When there is precontract,
for honesty,
Affinitie, and disability:
These twelve from present
marriage us disswade,
Or can retract from wedlock
when 'tis made.
I end with this of Socrates:
Let men obey the
Lawes, and women their
Husbands, whose duty is to
bee wise in speaking, and
mild in conversation; circumspect
in promise, and
carefull in performance;
faultlesse in taking, and faithfull
in giving good counsell;
patient in adversity, and not
puft up in^ prosperitie; somewhat
indulgent over his
wife, but most industrious
in the education of his children.
And a good wife, according
to Theophrastus, must
bee grave abroad, gentle at
home, constant to love,

patient to suffer, obs^quio^^
to her neighbours, obedi^nt
to her husband. For silence
and patience are the two i^
dissoluble ties of conjugall
love and piety.


CHAP. VII.

What manner of Lectures
Wives in the Country re^^
to their Husbands. The
severall dispositions of
Wives, and humours of
Husbands, illustrated by
divers selected Histories.
The morosity of the marriage bed.

YOu see what marriag^ (...)
or at least what it oug^^

to be. But hitherto I have
onely read a Lecture unto
women, but I come now to
shew you what manner of
Lectures wives use to read
unto their husbands: and for
method sake I will devide
them into severall heads.
And first begin with the
Country. I find in a Prog^ostication
or Almanac^e,
continued from the date
^^ereof to the end of the
world, written by Iacobus
Henrichmanus, and (...)
to the generous S. Christophar^s
Baron of Schwarze^^berg:
and the illustrious
Poet Henric^s ^ebelli^s;
to this purpose. In this

yeere, saith he, Virgins an^
Wives shall have long
haire and short memories:
women shall participate in
their domesticall government
with their husband^*
and strive to rule alike, if
not with precedence; and
when they are willing to
sleepe, whisper many private
lectures in their eares,
which they would not listen
unto: old strumpets shall
be apt to negotiate betwixt
young men and new married
wives, to make sinfull
bargaines: moreover, there
are divers which shall be^
suspected to be honest, and
though they be not so, yet

shall they be glad to take the
injury upon themselves.
The same Bebellius, in his
fecetiae, saith, that from women:
themselves hee hath
received three things, in
which there is no credit to
be given unto them. First,
when shee weepes, because
she can command teares at
her will: next, if she feigne
her selfe to bee sicke, for
there is no trust to bee imposed
upon her till thou
seest her quite dead: and
lastly, if having invited her
friends unto a great feast,
she simper or eate nothing,
(...) is to be presumed that she
^ath first dined in the kitchen,

or else she hath reserved th^
choicest bit of all, to please
her owne palate after the
guests be departed.
Foure things ^ill a man
before his time; a sad or
sorrowfull family, meate or
drinke immoderately taken,
a pestilent aire, and a faire
wife. Foure other thing^
wee are also to take gre^^
care, that we fo^beare: first,
how we read another (...)
letters, the contents nothing
concerning us; next how
wee meddle with any thing
in a Smi^hs shop, lest (...)
burn our fingers; then to b^
carefull what we taste (...)

light upon poison; lastly,
how we adventure upon any
woman, to grow into any
private familiarity with her,
whose condition^ we know
not. Others have a proverb
frequent in their mouthes,
that those men grow soone
rich, whose Bees prosper
and their wives perish; or
whose sheepe and oxen
th^ive with them, and their
^ives faile them.
If a man would have an
exact wife, indowed with all
the gifts of nature, the better
to dec^re her, she must have
an hand from Prague, a face
from Brittaine or England,
breasts from Austria, a belly

from France, a backe from
Brabant, white thighes and
hands from Colonia Agrippina,
feet from the Rhine,
pudibu^da from Bavaria, and
nates from Suevia. But from
the constitution of the body,
I come now to the condition
of the minde.
As there are many sorts
of wives, so there are many
kinds of husbands: as one
for instance (I begin with
the country.) A plaine country
fellow, upon some extraordinary
occasion comming
from plow before his
houre, found a young (...)
his neighbours sonne, (...)
busie with his wife, and

came suddenly upon them
before they could any way
^vade it; which hee seeing,
said to his wife, O sweet
heart, what is this I see?
could'st thou not have pickt
out a more private place
then this? Ile put it to thy
selfe, how scurvily would
this have showne, if any
stranger but my selfe had
come in, and seene what I
doe how? and with this
gentle admonition departed
(...).
But all husbands (as I said
before) are not of the like
temper; for instance: An
handsome country-wife, and
well reputed of amongst her

neighbours, used every
night as soone as her husband
came to bed, to catechize
him, what companie
he had kept? and how hee
had spent the day? and
still used to keepe him waking
past midnight, when
the poore honest man, who
had travelled hard all the
day, had rather been at rest;
and that shee would have
read him asleepe. But at
length observing that shee
was somewhat precisely given,
and that shee used often
to goe to confession, he began
to consider what great
sins she might be guilty of,
of which she need so often

to desire absolution: and to
that purpose watching the
time when shee used to goe
unto her Confessour, he had
gotten into the Church before,
and privately hid himselfe,
so neere to the Altar
that hee might easily heare
whatsoever passed betwixt
them: and when amongst other
quotidian (or as some
call them venial sins:) she began
to proceed further, and
say that she had committed
adultery with such a man so
often, and so often with such a
neighbour: her Conf^ssor
began with her and said, indeed
sister the sinne of adultery
is a great and hainous

crime* and therefore leaving
the rest, I will begin to ^llot
you pennance for that:
at which word the fellow
rising out) of his place (...),
No good Sir you shall not
need to doe that, I pray you
absolve her of all the rest of
her sinnes, but for tha^ of
adultery ile give her such
pennance ile warrant her,
that she shall not need complaine,
and desire other
from you: so taking her by
the arme led her home and
basted her soundly.
Poggius the Florentine, an
excellent Oratour, in his F^cetiis,
reporteth this storie.
A woman amongst us (saith

^e) (...) so contrary unto
her husband in all things,
that whatsoever shee had
said, how absurd, ^oever it
(...)* (...) maintaine
it even to death; who scolding
and bitterly railing
against her husband, one
day amongst many other
^^veries which shee gave
him to weare for her sake,
she called him lowsie knave*
(...) which words (...)
wondrous (...), hee
beate her with his (...), and
^ickt her with his heeles;
(...):

(...)
so tired himselfe with ^ea^ing
her, that he was (...)
able to lift his arme so high
(...) his head, and yet vowing
to himselfe that hee would
then get the must^ry or never,
he b^th ought himselfe
of another (...), and tying
her fast to a cord, let (...)
downe into a Well, there
threatning to drowne (...)
unlesse she would (...) that
language: but the more (...)
menac't her, the lowde^ (...)
talk't, not changing a syllable:
at length he (...)
bodie so farre as to the (...),
and yet nothing was in he^

mouth but lowsie (...),
which she often repeated;
hee then ducked her over
head and eares; when not
being able to speak because
the water choa^ed her, what
^she could not doe with her
tongue she expressed with
her^ fingers, and holding
her armes above water, by
joyning the nailes of her
two thumbs together, she
did that in action, which she
was not able to deliver in
words; in so much that her
(...) obstinacy prevailing
above his punishment,
hee was forc't to draw her

a subject to her morosity

and (...)
Another Countrey (...)
wife, when no Lecture
she could reade unto her
husband (though (...)
him with many* and
those not empty of variety)
could prevaile with him,
when she found that she (...)
not able to being him (...)
her owne bow, in a (...)
malicious despaire (...)

and so drowned her self^.
At length the place being
shewed to the good man
where she plunged in, (...)
her body not appearing (...)
the water, he (...)
dragge for i^ against the

streame; but his neighbours
advising him not to take
that course, but rather to
search for her with the
streame; he made answer,
My good neighbours no
such matter, for know that
in her life time she was so
obstinate, froward, and contrary
to all reason, that even
in death her very body must
needs swim against the tide,
though it be preposterous
against nature.
This calls to my remembrance
that of the Cyn^^ke
D^ogenes, who was wont to
(...), he allowed of them
who were in a readinesse to
saile upon the sea, but sailed

not* who were about to gi^e
other mens children their
breeding, but bred them
not; who advised with
themselves to take upon
them the affaires of the
Common-weale, but tooke
them not; and who was alwaies
towards wiving, but
wedded not: intimating
those persons to be wise
who runne not rashly into
such things of which they
have not before made
proofe and triall. For when
men are once entred into
them, they forfeit their own
liberty, as not able to retract
or withdraw themselves at
their pleasure. Whoso committeth

himselfe to the
mercy of the seas, must
stand to the grace of the
windes and weather: whoso
undergoeth publike office
or magistracy, cannot at his
will (...) himselfe to a private
state and condition of
living: and whosoever marrieth
a wife, if he be said not
(...).
The same Philosopher
(...) a very faire woman
(...) in a^ horse (...) or
(...), he said to one that
stood by him, Now surely
another cage than that had
beene more (...)

of that kind: noting that
such froward creatures as
some women be, are more
fitting to looke out of a
grate than a casement. The
Le^tica in Greece, which I
here call a horse-litter, was
a certaine manner of ^eat
neere unto that fashion; in
which noble women and
great Ladies w^re used to
be born through the streets,
not by horses, but upon
some sixe mens shoulders;
being made with Lattice
windows, and grates cro^^e-barred;
which our late Sedans
in some things imitate.
Those casements were to open
and shut at pleasure, that

they might looke and bee
seen, or not: so that it shewed
and represented to the eie
the manner and likenesse of
a cage for birds, or a pen, in
which to keepe divers
strange beasts: which was in
great frequency among the
Grecians. And in such did
the wives of the Areopagitae,
or chiefe S^natours, and
other great Ladies use to be
borne through the streets;
and in imitation of them, oftentimes
loose and wanton
damsells: for great persons
cannot devise that for state,
which the proud (how poor
soever) will not strive to imitate.
I have read further, of a
Countrey-man, who had a
notorious scold to his wife;
and whether he came from
the market, or from the
field; or whether hee sate
downe to meat, or prepared
himselfe for bed, she was alwaies
thundring in his eares:
nay she would not cease doctrinating
him in his neighbours
house, but home and
abroad were both alike u^^to
her; and still the more he
threatned or cudgeled her,
her contumelious railing was
still more insolent and l^wd,
abusing him in language by
no allowance. At length he
thought to try conclusions,

and provided himselfe of an
harsh tun'd pipe, on which
he could not play any thing
that tended to musicke; and
ever when shee began to
s^old, he streight without any
reply began to play, but
so untunably and shrill, that
it almost drowned her language:
this fretted her
worse, in regard that he^
gave her no other answer at
all, whereby to give her
matter to worke upon, in so
much that for very anger
and despight she left off railing,
and fell to skipping and
dancing: of which being
weary, as having tired her
selfe, she flew up to his face,

(...)
other (having a shrew to his
wife); I marry Gossip, this
is a good sight, it were happy
for us in the countrey if
all the rest of our trees had
the like fruit hanging upon
them. I conclude this chapter
with that of Iuvenall
in his 6. Satyr.

The marriage bed hath seldome
yet been free
From mutuall braules and
nuptiall calumny;
Sleepe in their resting place
hath no abiding,
She'l keep thee waking with
continuall chiding.
Jealous shee must bee thou
hast gone astray,
Then worse than Tigers
(who have lost their prey)
She rageth, and t'encourage
this debate,
Those children shee best
loves shee'l seem to hate.
Some strumpet she will fashion
in her minde,
And sweare that thou to her
art far more kind.
With one or other shee up
braids thee still,
Then weeps amain, for sh^
hath teares at will.




CHAP. VIII.

The love that ought to be betwixt
man and wife. Why
women speake more and
lowder than men. Of a (...)
married wife. Divers
other Histories of pleasant
passages in the country.

A Question being asked,
why our first and
great Grandmother Evah,
was rather in her formacio^
taken out of the side of Adam,
than any other part of
his bodie? It was thus learnedly
answered: Because the
side is the middle of the body,
to signifie that the woman
is of equall dignitie

with the man; and therefore
shee was taken not from the
head, nor the foot; for she
must not be superiour or inferiour
unto him. It is probable
also that shee was
taken out of the left side:
for the heart of man inclineth
that way, rather
than to the other; to denote
unto us, that man and woman
should imbrace each
other with an hearty and intire
love: and as the left side
is the weakest, so the woman
made from thence, is
the weaker ve^^ell. Also all
male children are conceived
in the right side, and the females
in the left: and as the

sides are defended by the
armes, so ought a woman to
be by her husband.
Another demanding a
question, why women
were more apt to talke, and
for the most part, make a
greater and lowder noise than
men? Answer was returned,
that for that there was very
great reason to be given:
for saith he, wee know that
Adam the first man was
created from the dust of the
earth, which is of its own nature,
soft, pliant and tractable,
and in the handling yeeldeth
no noise or sound at all: but
the woman was made of a
ribbe (a bone taken out of

Adams side) which is of a
much harder temper. Now
for example, take a bushell
bagge or a quarter sacke, and
fill it with dust, or with
flesh, and tumble it or tosse
it which way you please, no
eccho ariseth from thence at
all; but empty them, and
fill them with bones, and
so shake and bowlt them together,
and you sh^ll then
heare what a ratling they
will keepe.
Of a more gentle disposition
than those before remembred,
was she of whom
I now am to speake, who instead
of a Curtaine Lecture,
read by her to her husband,

had a strange one read to
her; the manner whereof
followeth. Not farre from
Reevilling, a Towne under
the Imperiall jurisdiction, a
very faire country wench,
but very simple withall,
who was newly married to
one of the young rusticks
there by, some quarter of a
yeere after shee had beene
married, came to a Friar to
be confest, who casting an adulterous
eye upon her, and
finding her by her simple answer
to bee none of the wisest:
the businesse which she
came for, being quickly run
over, he presently fell upon
another matter, and told

her that she was run into
a great arrerage with him,
for not paying him Tithes.
The woman innocently demanded
of him what Tithes
were due to him? Marry
saith hee, for every nine
nights which thou liest with
thy husband, the tenth is
due to me. Truely Sir, replied
she, I pray you to excuse
mine ignorance, and
heaven forefend but whatsoever
should bee due unto
you from mee, should bee
fully satisfied. At which hee
retired her into a sequestred
place, and there abused her
honest simplicitie. After
which returning backe to

her house, shee began modestly
to chide her husband,
who would not tell
her of those duties and
tithes due to the Friar her
Confessour, and so told him
all the whole circumstances
before related. The man
said little, knowing the
weaknesse of his Wife, and
loath to have his owne
shame to be made publike,
yet vowing revenge in
heart; and fearing that being
a Churchman, upon his
complaint the Friar might
find some favour with the
great ones, he bethought
himself of a safer course, and
resolved withall to bee his

owne justicer: for, dissembling
the matter, and taking
no notice at all of any
such thing as passed betwixt
the Friar and his
Wife, he made meanes to
infinuate into his more familiar
acquaintance; to
which the Friar most willingly
assented, because under
that colour hee might
have the freer and lesse suspitious
consocietie with his
Wife. Upon this new acquaintance,
the rusticke invited
him to dinner, and defired
him to come alone;
which was a motion that he
willingly imbraced. The
day was appointed, and

good cheare provided: now
the good man commanded
his Wife to reserve all the
water shee made for two
dayes together, and keepe
it in a vessell by it selfe;
which was accordingly
done: hee invites two or
three of his neighbours,
whom hee durst best trust.
The Friar keepeth his appointment,
the dinner is served
in, and he set betwixt a
couple of them so close that
there was no rising from
the table without leave: the
first trenchers were not
changed, but the good man
takes a deepe bowle, and
drinketh it off to the Friars

welcome (of wine good and
wholsome:) the Friar vowes
to pledge him supernaculum,
and still casting a leering
eye upon the woman,
which the Host very well
observed; he whispereth to
have the Friars bowle brimmed
with his Wives urine:
which he taking and tasting,
spit it out and said, Now fie,
what tart and unpleasant
wine is this? if I should
drinke it, it would poyson
me. The good man replied,
Doth not then this wine tast
you well? He replied, No
by no meanes: No, saith the
Host? Ile assure you it was
drawne out of the same vessell

from which you received your
Tithes; and either drinke it
off at one carowse, or bee
assured that it is the l^st you
shall ever swallow. By
which the Friar finding his
former villany discovered,
tooke it off at a draught,
concluding with a sowre
sawce his former sweet bargaine:
and being dismissed
thence without any other
violence, vowed to himselfe,
never to come under that
mans roofe after.
I have read of a fellow
who travelled a great part
of the world over with a
paire of boots, which hee
had vowed to part with

to no man, but such a one as
had an absolute power and
Empire over his wife: he
had past through many
Countries, and offered them
to all that he met, but no
man was either willing, or
else durst not accept them
upon these conditions: at
length meeting with a stout
fellow, a Black-smith, he
asked him if he would receive
them upon the covenant
aforesaid? who answered
that he would, and
weare them in despight of
all the women in Europe:
(now the Smith had put on
a cleane shirt that morning)
Upon this answer the Traveller

replied, Then Friend,
here take them to thee, put
them into thy bosome, and
beare them home. The
Smith replied, Not so, I
know a tricke worth two of
that: if I should put them
into my bosome, and durty
my cleane shirt, my wife
would not be well pleased
with that, for we should
have no quietnesse in the
house for all this day.
Which the other hearing,
snatched them away from
him, and said, Get thee
hence in an evill houre, who
goest about to cheat me,
being, as all others, afraid
of thy wives scolding; and

so left him: nor have I heard
whether he hath yet delivered
them unto any even to
this day.
A Countrey fellow having
married a substantiall
Farmers daughter, found
her within a twelve-moneth
to prove not only an archscold,
still thundering in his
eares, but very lascivious
and unchaste, of which he
had manifest and infallible
proofes; and therefore hee
tooke occasion to complain
to his father-in-law both of
the morosity and inchastity
of his daughter. To whom
the good man gave this
comfort; Son, I advise you

to have patience, and be content
for a time: she is her mothers
daughter right, for just
such an one was she in her
youth, for I could neither
governe her tongue, nor--
but now she is growne old,
there is not a more quiet
and chaste Matron amongst
all her neighbours: therefore
arme your selfe with
patience as I did, and I make
no question but when the
daughter shall arrive unto
her mothers age, your wife
will prove as tractable and
quiet as mine is now; and
with this cold comfort dismist
him:
Another Rusticke being

married to a very handsome
peece, grew jealours of a
young fellow a Farmers
son, his neighbour (and
he had divers times upbraided
her with him:) at length
being angry, she bid him
not to feare any such matter
betwixt them, and protested,
she had rather prostitute
her selfe to ten Gentlemen,
than to one such clown
as himselfe, or him whom
he had so often cast in her
teeth.
Another Countrey woman,
following her husband
to his grave, not onely wept
and wrung her hands, but
tore her haire from her

head, uttering such lowd
cries and ejulations, that she
was much pitied, in regard
they feared that the very
sorrow for his death would
distract her of her senses.
Divers came about her to
comfort her, and they had
much adoe to keepe her
from leaping into his grave.
The like she did comming
backe. At length one that
was a widower, and well
knowne unto her, stept towards
her to lead her home
by the arme, and spake divers
comfortable words unto
her. To whom she answered,
No, she was undone
for ever, for she was left a

lone woman, and a widow,
and had none to manage her
affaires, or to guide her family.
Who replied, Let not
that be your care, I am, you
know, a widower, and if it
please you to accept of me,
my suit is, that I may be
your second husband. To
whom she still weeping and
howling made answer, I
thanke you neighbour for
your good will and friendly
offer, but indeed you
speake too late, for I have
already past my faith and
promise to another.
One related unto me of
one who pretended great
purity and modesty, who

could not endure any u^civill
speech or obscene talke,
and one indeed whom all
the young men desired their
wives to pattern themselve^
by; she being brought to
bed of a boy, which was her
first child, as soone as the
child was borne, all the women
came about it, and every
one gave their censure of
him, and concluded, it was
^ sweet babe, and like the father:
which shee hearing,
rowsing her selfe as well as
she was able, said, Why I
pray you neighbours, hath
it a shaven crowne? which
put them in mind of a young
Friar who had often before

frequented the house.
A Rusticke having the
day before beaten his wife
for reading a Lecture unto
him somewhat too lowd,
sent her the next day with a
Sow to the market to sell.
Her way lying through a
parke or thicke wood, and
she driving the Swine before
her with a cord tied to
the hinder leg, a young
Clowne of her former acquaintance,
and who had
long beene a suitor to her to
corrupt her chastity (but never
prevailing) overtooke
her just as she was entring
into the thicket; and having
first given her the good

morrow, began earnestly to
importune her about his
former fuit, alledging, amongst
other things, the opportunity
of time and place
but she still obstinately denied
him, and in such rigorous
words, that seeing her
resolution, he forbare to
speake of it any further, and
began to talke of other
things. But when she perceived
they were almost
out of the forrest, and that
they were ready to come into
the open fields, and remembring
how churlishly
her husband had dealt with
her the day before, she began
thus to break with him,

and say, You spake unto me
even now of a businesse I
know not what, and urged
me to a thing which I may
be sorry for I know not
when; but if I should now
be so mad or foolish to yeeld
to your request, I pray you
in the meane time where can
you find a tree in all this (...)
to which to tie the
Sow? Which being apprehended
by the other, she
found occasion to revenge
her selfe upon her husband.
And this is growne to be a
common Proverb in other
Countries, But if I should
be so foolish as to yeeld unto
you, where in the meane

time can you find a fit tree to
which to tie the Sow? From
the Countrey I come now
to the City.


CHAP. IX.

How Curtaine Lectures are
read in the Citie, and how
severally read by sundrie
Tradesmens wives, with
variety of delightfull histories
to that purpose.

THere be foure things
(saith mine Authour)
which women most covet;
To be beloved of young
men, To be the mothers of
fine children, To weare

rich and costly clothes,
and to domineere and beare
rule in their houses.
A Tailor in the Citie,
who kept his wife very gallant
(who was indeed a very
choice girle, and well became
those cloathes which
she wore) before he had
beene married a full twelve-moneth,
perceiving divers
young Citizens, and other
Gallants, often to pass by his
doore, and sometimes make
impertinent businesse to his
house, he thinking to prevent
the worst, call'd up his
wife one day into a private
chamber, and began to
question her about sundry

things, of which the woman
was meerely innocent: all
this would not perswade
the man, but being absolutely
jealous of her honesty,
he began to schoole her in
very rough and course language;
which wakened a fire
in her bosome which till
then lay hid, and now brake
forth at her tongue. Then
she told him what matches
she might have had when
she was a maid, and what
fortunes she had neglected
in making choice of him*
how she might have beene
married to a man, and now
she had cast her selfe away
upon a Tailor; with the like:

in so much that when shee
had once begun she knew
not how to make an end, but
call'd him foole, and jealous
coxcomb, putting him to
such a silence, that he had
not one word to utter; but
waiting till the storme was
over, he then began to flatter
her, and give her the best
language that he could devise,
with which they were
reconciled betweene themselves,
and made friends.
He then began to breake
with her further, that for
their continuance of love,
and to avoid all suspicion or
controversie that might after
arise betwixt them, she

would sweare unto certaine
Articles which he would
propound unto her? Who
answered, she would with
all her heart; but upon condition,
that afterall, he would
sweare her also to one thing
which her selfe would propound.
Who gladly answered
that he would. This being
constantly agreed betwixt
them, he began thus;
Sweet wife, will you never
depart over this threshold
without my leave, but acquaint
me first with the businesse
which you goe about?
Who answered him,
Sweet husband I will. Next
saith he, Will you never offer

to cast a wanton glance
upon any man? Or whosoever
shall offer to tempt
your chastity, to deliver unto
me his name? Willingly,
saith she. Will you also
sweare, saith he, whilst you
live to be true (...) my bed,
and never (...) that conjugall
tie (...) is past betwixt
u^? Who answered,
With all my heart. And observing
his palpable jealousie,
asked him if these vvere
all? Who answered, Yes: and
withall sweet wife (saith
he) novv vvhat is that further
vvhich you de^ire that I
should bind you to by oath?
Who replied, Onely this

svveet husband, that after
these oathes taken, you vvill
svveare me that I shall not
keepe any one of these articles
vvhich you vvould have
me svvorne to. Which said,
she stept out of the chamber,
dovvne into the kitchin, and
left him ruminating upon
this ansvver.
Another Tradesmans wife
(for I vvill name no particular
Trade, to avoid offence)
her husband being at a Faire
in the Countrey, the Foreman
of his shop, vvhom he
had left to manage his affaires
at home, cast many a
vvanton looke upon his Mistresse,
and she failed not

to ansvver him vvith the
like: at length he put on
that audacity to move her in
the businesse, but she counterfeited
anger, and seemed
altogether averse to his suit,
threatning him, if he persisted
to prosecute it any
further, she vvould acquaint
his Master vvith it at his
comming home; vvhich
made him at that time to
urg^ it no further. But still
such interchange of vvanton
glances continued betvvixt
them, that it emboldened
him in a second encounter:
in vvhich he desired her to
take the advantage of his
Masters absence; but still she

ansvvered him vvith No;
till at length hee urging
still further, from No shee
said nothing at all; vvhich
gave him such encouragement,
that the same night,
leaving his Mistresse making
her selfe unready in the
kitchin, hee stole into her
chamber, and stripping himselfe,
got into the bed, and
covered himselfe over head
and eares. At length up
comes his Mistresse, and having
lockt her chamber fast
to her, unclothes her selfe
to her next linnen; and before
the candle vvas out, opening
the bed to step in,
^pi'd him as he lay: at which

she began to rate him, and
call'd him all the bad names
she could (but softly:) at
which the fellow, fearing
she would have call'd out,
and made an uproare in the
house, and so have taken him
before he was napping, desired
her of pardon, and said
he would willingly rise and
goe from thence unto his
owne chamber. To whom
she replied; Fellow, thou
dost not heare me talke of
thy rising, nor of thy going
hence to thine ow^ chamber,
for it is not that which I
speake of; but it is thy saucinesse
and boldnesse that I
blame, who wouldst offer

to creepe into thy Masters
place without the consent of
thy Mistresse. Well, for this
time I pardon thee, but
charge you, without first
getting my good will, to do
so no more hereafter; and
without more words put
out the candle, and went to
bed to him.
The like to this was related
me of another, who importuned
his mistresse to
lewdnesse in the absence of
his master; to which act
shee would no way appeare
to give any consent at all:
but he thinking to prove
her to the full, told her that
he had vowed to steale into

her chamber that night, nay
more, into her bed. Wilt thou
saith she? doe it then upon
thine owne perill, and I
will leave the doore open
a purpose; but withall I
tell thee before hand, I will
lay a knife ready drawn under
my beds head, with
which (if thou offerest to
enter) I will kill thee. Night
came, and she stript her selfe,
put out the candle, and went
to bed: anone after in comes
hee* and softly stealing
(whilst she counterfeited a
sound and dead sleep) to the
bed side, he began to open
the sheetes, but finding her
not to move at all, doubted

to enter, left being suddenly
started, shee with the knife
might doe him a mischiefe;
and therefore thought to
goe ^oftly out as he came in:
which shee perceiving, as if
shee had suddenly awaked
out of sleepe, asked, Who
art thou? who is there?
Hee answered againe, It is
I. What I, saith shee againe?
So hee told her his
name. And whats your businesse
here at this time of
the night? Marry saith he,
I had thought to have come
to bed to you, but that I
durst not for your knife,
and therefore I am going
hence: which hearing, she

replied, Now beast that I
was to forget the knife,
and leave it below in the
kitchen; and therefore if
thou shouldest stay and venture,
there could be no great
danger in it.
A lusty stout fellow in
the Suburbs having a curst
shrew to his wife, for all his
valour could never master
her tongue, but early and
late shee would so whisper
in his eares, that all the
whole street might ring of
her. At length he beat her
so soundly, that shee durst
not thunder unto him for
some weekes after; in so
much that hee verily presumed

he had got the victory
over her, and so hee stick't
not to boast to all his neighbours
about: which vexed
her not a little, and therefore
she thought in her selfe,
to be revenged upon him at
one time or other, and for
that she but waited for some
fit oppor^unitie or other. (...)
hapned that upon a summer
evening, he and his Wife,
sitting amongst others of
the neighbours and their
wives, she made the motion
that they should goe to a
sport call'd All-hid, which is
a meere chil^rens pastime;
to which they, then being
set upon a merry pin, agreed.

Now shee had perswaded
her husband to creepe into a
Sacke, which he, in regard
of her late conformitie suspecting
nothing, was willing
to do: and when she had
tied the Sackes mouth fast,
she call'd in two or three of
her like conditioned Gossips,
to whom shee had acquainted
her project, and
they every one with a good
cudgell did so bast the gentleman,
that hee thought his
very bones to rattle in his
skin; and notwithstanding
all his intreatie or faire promises,
they would not let
him out, or suffer him to take
breath, till hee had sworne

unto them, not to take up
so much as a small sticke to
strike her ever after; to
which (being almost stifled)
he was forced to sweare; nor
did hee offer the lest blow
after, in regard of his oath.
But not long after, a great
Wedding being kept in that
street, and he and his wife
invited amongst the rest, after
dinner they fel to dance:
amongst the rest hee tooke
his wife to taske, and being
in a measure where the men
are to take the women in
their armes, and lift them
up from the ground, hee
took up his wife, and turning
round with her till hee came

to the top of the staires, and
then letting her fall headlong,
she tumbled downe to
the bottome, and great odds
she had not broke her neck;
and this hee did laughing.
But such was her good fortune
that shee was onely
bruised, as hee had before
been beaten; and finding it
no advantage for her further
to contend with him, shee
submitted her selfe, and hee
accepted of her submission;
which on both sides was
so unfainedly done, that
they lived in great unity and
love all the rest of their
life after.
But not altogether to tire

the Reader with quarrelling
and scolding: I was told of a
very faire virgin of the City,
who by her fathers enforcement
(but farre against
her owne minde) was compeld
to matcht with an ancient
and grave Citizen; who
finding her sitting very sad
and pensive the same day of
her marriage, came to comfort
her: and grasping her about
the waste, said, Bee of
good cheere my faire wife,
an old horse will travell and
goe through a long journey
as wel as a young. At which
words she fetching a grea^
sigh, and laying her hand
upon the bottome of her

belly, said, I, but I feare Sir,
not in this rode way.
Another Tradesman having
a drunken queane to
his wife, whom he could never
keepe from the alehouse,
but whatsoever hee
got she was ready to spend:
or if shee had no monie, she
would pawne vvhatsoever
vvas about the house; and
sittippling among her Gossips,
somtimes till past midnight,
and then be led home,
or carried when her owne
legs vvere not able to beare
her. And he having read many
a Lecture unto her (as
telling her vvhat a loathsome
sin drunkennesse vvas,

that the end thereof vvas no
other then hell fire, with
the like good admonitions,
but all in vaine. Upon a
night, vvhen vvith Ale and
hot vvaters shee vvas so overcome,
that shee vvas
brought home both speechlesse
and senselesse, hee
thought to trie a conclusion,
if possible it vvere to ^eforme
it in her: and causing
her to bee laid upon a cold
earthen floore, he made a
great fire, vvhich compast
her about, and calling in his
neighbours, for vvhom he
had provided (as for himselfe)
furies coates, and every
one with a fire-brand in his

hand, attending her awaking;
vvho by reason of
the heat which compast her,
rowsed her somewhat before
her time, and looking
about her, she began verily
to thinke shee vvas in Hell
fire, vvith vvhich her husband
had so often before
threatned her, and the rather,
because so many like
Devils stood about her:
then fetching a deep sigh,
the first vvords she uttered
vvere, Alas poore wretched
soule that I am, to be thus incompast
vvith the flames of
Hell: Is there never a ghost
amongst you all so thirsty
as I am novv, that vvill joyn

their pennie vvith mine,
that vvee may send for a
double pot of Ale? At
which the neighbours breaking
out into a lowd laughter,
they discovered themselves
unto her; and finding
her no vvay to bee reclaimed,
got her to bed, and
left her to bee a perpetuall
torment to the honest man
her husband.
(...) hath beene related to
me, that in the time of auricular
confession, three young
Citizens vvives came to
a devoute man, vvho vvas
their ghostly Father, to be
shriven: and he demanding
of them what grievous ^ins

they had committed, saith
the first, The greatest sinne
that I suppose my selfe to be
guilty of, was that upon a
time, I tooke a strange knife
which was not mine owne,
and put it into my sheath.
The good man not much
considering upon the matter,
but thinking that young
timerous vvomen vvould
take the least errour to be a
very hainous offence, past
it slightly over, and demanded
of the second, How
shee had offended? Who
made ansvver that shee had
put two into hers: hee past
her over with the like slightnesse,
and demanded the like

of the third? Who made
answer that indeed she was
guilty of putting three
knives into hers. Is this all
said hee? They answered,
Yes. Then, saith he, I will dispatch
you presently, and having
quickly absolved the
two first, and comming to
the third, he began to consider
with himselfe, what
sheath it was which should
hold three knives, when
hee never saw any that held
more then two and a bodkin;
and asked her what she
meant by those knives? To
whom she plainly answered,
that three severall men had
had the use of her body, besides

her husband: when
presently finding the errour,
he call'd the former whom
he had ignorantly absolved,
and said, Get you hence for,
three pestilent and cunning
baggages; I absolve
none of you all, you have
confest amisse: What, would
you make me beleeve, that
betwixt Penis and Cultellus
is no difference? And so
unshriven in a great anger
he dismist them.



CHAP. X.

Pleasant discourse betwixt a
Noble man and a Merchant.
Lectures read by
country Gentlewomen and
Ladies to their husbands.
By the souldiers wife, to
her Captaine or Leiv^enant.
And of Court Ladies
to their Lords.

A Nobleman and a worthy
Merchant jesting
together freely, without any
exceptions to bee taken,
saith the Nobleman to him,
I wonder at you Merchants,
who for the most part have
very beautifull and faire
wives, that dare trust them

here at home, whil'st you
take such long voyages into
Countries so farre remote:
surely it cannot choose but
bee a great trouble to your
minds being abroad, for
feare they should violate
their conjugall tie at home:
when wee Noblemen deale
more securely; for if we take
a journey either from the
Court to the Country, or
from the Country up to the
Court, we leave our Ladies
well accommodated and guarded
by Servants, Groomes,
and Pages. The Merchant
perceiving how hee plaid
upon him, said unto him
againe (by your Lordships

favour, and without offence
be it spoken) How comes it
to be a proverb, that Noblemens
children are not (for
the most part) so well featured
and favoured, as the sons
and daughters of Citizens?
If your Lordship will not
be offended, I can shew you
the reason. I pray thee doe,
saith the Noble man, I give
thee free leave and libertie
to speake. Then thus, saith
the Merchant, In the absence
of all such Merchants
as have houses in the City,
it being so populous, there
are choice either of young
Aldermens sons, or of such
lusty young Gallants as use

to insidiate the chastities of
beautifull women in the
absence of their husbands;
and they having their choice,
will commonly picke out
the properest men to transgresse
with; and so betwixt
them commeth a faire and
well featured issue: when
you Noblemen taking your
journeies, take all your Gentlemen
along to attend you,
leaving none with your Ladies,
but a Chamberlaine,
Cooke, or a Coachman, and
they in your absence being
glad to make use of such
course groomes, I suppose
that may be the reason why
your children are not so faire

and well favoured as ours.
At which answer, the Nobleman
smil'd, and taking
the retort as well as the
Merchant did the jest put
upon him at first, they parted
without any further excep^ion.
But ere I come to
the Court, I must first looke
backe upon the, Country,
and see how the Gentlewoman
there bred useth to
lecture to her Esquire or
Knight: and after how the
Souldiers wife useth to read
to her Lievtenant o^ Captaine.
An Esquires wife, being
an excellent housewife,
but of a very loud tongue

withall, used to taxe him for
being too free in his kitchen,
sellar and at his table;
for keeping too many inpertinent
servants, too many
horses and dogs, hounds,
grey-hounds and spaniels,
hawkes, etc. which drew
him to unnecessary charges.
Then laied the law to
him, what hee might save in
the yeere, which he vainely
and profusely wasted; with
divers other things to the
like purpose, with so often
iteration (as preaching still
upon one text) both at boord
and in bed, that tired with
her continuall clamours, and
withall shee often forbearing

his imbraces, unlesse
he would reforme all things
according to her minde, and
leave all his estate to her
sole management, he grew
not to love her so well as
at the first, and casting his
eie upon a pretty slut, his
Gardeners wife, hee neglecting
his own, grew very
much enamored of her, but
durst not come to the house,
by reason of his wives jealousie;
yet he wrought so by
one of his servants, who
dealt for him to the woman,
that shee was willing to
yeeld to any thing to doe
her Master a pleasure, so it
might bee done safely, and

without suspition, either
from her husband or her
mistresse. It was then concluded,
that they should
meet in a lodge some halfe
a mile from the Mannor
house, and to that purpose,
hee had sent his Gardener
some twenty miles out of
the towne; and the better
to conveigh her thither, he
commanded his man to provide
a large basket into
which to put the woman,
and cover it with strewing
flowers, hearbs, and sallets;
which was accordingly
done. The Master of the
house got up early to keepe
this appointment: so was

the Mistresse to dogge her
husband, as mistrusting his
early rising: and in the way
meets this fellow with his
basket, the bottome of
which, by reason of the
weight of the woman, was
quite broken, and her legs
and feet hung downe below
his knees: which shee
perceiving, call'd the fellow
unto her, and asked him
what hee had in his basket?
Sallets Mistresse; saith hee:
Sallets, and nothing else?
Nothing Mistresse, saith he,
but hearbs and sallets. Well
saith shee, carry them to
your Master, and tell him
from mee, this is a fish day,

and bid him beware what
flesh hee tasteth with those
sallets. The fellow nothing
perceiving all this
while* makes way to the
lodge, and delivers his burthen;
the Gentlewoman followes,
and before her Husband
discovers the woman.
The cause was at first somewhat
bitterly debated betwixt
them; but all the
choler being vented, they
fell to a more mild attonement:
in which it was concluded,
He would ever after
forsake his lust, so long as
shee would forbeare her
Lecture.
A Knights wife in the

Country was perfect in the
same doctrine, and read it as
freely as the former; and tiring
him one morning with
a tale of an houre long, he
not interrupting her in one
syllable, she vexing all this
while that he made her no
answer, at length for meere
wearinesse she gave over.
Then he knockt as lowd as
he could, till one came up:
he then commanded him to
call up the servants of the
house, men-servants and
maid-servants, up into the
chamber, and that instantly:
who presently ran downe as
he was commanded; she in
the meane time wondring

what it might meane: (I
forgot to tell you that hee
bade them to bring their
Church books with them.)
Well, all of them came up
thus accommodated, and demanded
what his Worships
pleasure was? Marry (saith
he) this was the cause I sent
for you, my wife hath preached
to me a very learned
Sermon, in which she borrowed
somewhat of the
houre-glasse, and exceeded
her time, and it is but now
ended, and I desire it may
not goe off without a
Psalme; and therefore saith
he (and was going on) when
she interrupting him, said,

Get you all downe about
your severall affaires, and
that I charge you instantly,
or you shall heare from me
in another kind. Which
they incontinently did:
when she, ashamed of the
^ricke he had put upon her,
desired him to use it or the
like no more, and she would
never trouble him either in
his nights sleep or his mornings
rest after.
I come now to the Souldiers
wife. It is recorded of
a brave and noble Captaine
to have a brauling shrew to
his wife, from which turbiflency
he could by no gentle
meanes reclaime her; and

therefore hee so awed her
with threats and menaces,
and now and then with a
kicke or a blow, that she
was forced to give her unseasonable
Lectures quite
over. Then she going often
to confession, still when she
came to her ghostly father,
in stead of her owne faults
reckoned up all that she either
knew or could devise
of her husband. In so much
that the good man meeting
with the Captain, gave him
courteous admonitory counsell,
as to leave drinking,
swearing, rioting, and the
like; by which the Captaine
might perceive that some

or other had complained
of him. Not long after, the
woman insinuates with her
husband, that for any thing
that had ever past betwixt
them either in words or
blows, in which she was the
sole sufferer, she did heartily
forgive him, and desired the
like forgiveness from him, if
by her lowd tongue she had
any way offended him, promising
a reformation of all
her misdemeanours for ever
after; and therefore that
lasting unity might continue
betwixt them, she desired
him to goe to her ghostly
father, and heartily confesse
him of his sins, which would

be a mean to ratifie and confirme
all conjugall love betwixt
them. The Captaine
was perswaded, and went,
and comming before the
grave Church-man, told
him he was desired to come
unto him, and now being
here (saith he) I would know
what your will is with me.
Who said, I would wish
you to consider with your
selfe, and rub up your remembrance,
and calling to
mind all your sins and offences,
riots and disorders, and
what else; for which (repenting
of them unfeignedly)
I will give you present absolution.
Nay if that be all

(said the Captaine) that labour
is sav'd already, and
needs no second iteration;
I know you are my wives
Confessour, and she hath
told unto you all my sinnes,
and more than I ever did
or thought to doe already:
and so bluntly left
him.
A brave Lievtenant amongst
many other wounds
lost an eie in the wars, and afterward
retiring himself into
his own Country, where
he had some meanes to live
on, bethought himself, after
all those tumultuous dangers
past, to betake himselfe
to a peaceable and quiet

life; and to that purpose intended
to marry. A match
was presently offered him, a
Virgin (supposed) both of
good feature and competent
dower. The marriage day
came, and was past with
great joy and solemnity,
and the Bride and Bridegroome
(according to the
custome) brought to their
bed. The curtaines were
drawne, and they left to
their rest; when he comming
to doe the office of an
husband, perceived she had
bin before devirginated, and
was not a true maide; and
thrusting her from him in
great anger, said, A way thou

strumpet, I tooke thee for a
perfect Virgin, and now I
find thee to be a woman
flaw'd and unperfect. Who
boldly answered him again*
And is not the match equall*
since I have accepted of the^
being maimed, and wanting
one eye? But (repli'd he)
I received my hurt from
mine enemie. And I (answered
she) received th^^
which so much troubles
thee from my best friend.
I must be sparing to speak
of the Court: yet no question
even your Court Ladies
are women, and have
tongues, though they know
by their noble breeding better

how to governe them,
than others, who have not
had their generous education
and breeding. Amongst
the rest, I have read one
short story in an approved
Au^hor, that a Basket-maker
in the country, having with
his best care and cunning
made an end of an extraordinary
Basket, which had been
bespoke, and finding it finisht
to his owne desire and fancy,
(his wife then sitting by
him) he said, Now God be
thanked, I have finisht my
Basket, and I pray thee wife
say so too. But she being
ref^actory and obstinate,
held her tongue; and the

more he intreated her, the
more adverse shee was to
him, giving him foule and
course language. Which (...)
not able to endure, fell upon
her with a good cudgell, and
beat her till she was forc'd
to crie out. A Noble man
comming then by accidentally,
with a great traine a^
his heeles, finding her weeping,
began at first to commiserate
the woman, and to
chide the man for striking
her: but being by him truely
informed of the cause, he
commended the fellow for
justly correcting her dis^^
bedience, and told her (...)
had her mends in her (...)

hands: so left them; and rid
home to his house. At supper
he related all the circumstance
(before discoursed)
to his Lady, and asked
her opinion of the matter.
Who answered, The Basket-maker
vvas a Knave to
offer to beat his wife upon
so sleight an occasion. Who
replied unto her, Why Madam,
vvould you be so perverse
and obstinate unto me,
if I should command you
to speake these words? Indeed
my Lord, answered
she, I would. How, saith he?
I charge you to say these
vvords before all this company,
God be thanked, I

have finisht my Basket.
Who answered againe, My
Lord I vvill die before I
vvill doe it. At vvhich he
mightily enraged; rose
from the table, and taking a
battoone in his hand, had he
not beene held by maine
force by his noble guests
and his Gentlemen about
him, there had been as grea^
a fray betwixt them, as there
vvas vvith the Basket-maker
and the shrew his vvife.
Now what manner of Lecture
she read after to her
Lord I cannot relate, being
then not present to heare it.



CHAP. XI.

Twelve things that have
been the Authors of much
mischeife. Of the famous
and notorious scold Xantippe.
A Curtaine Lecture
read by a Queene to her
Husband, worthy all womens
imitation.

TWelve things have bin
the Authours of much
mischiefe: Age without
wisdome: Prudence without
imployment: A Master of
an house without a familie:
Pride without riches: Riches
without honour: Nobilitie
without vertue: A people

without awe: A Citie without
Lawes: Office without
clemencie: Youth without
feare: A religious life without
peace: A woman without
shame.
And such an one was
Xantippe, the wife of Socrates;
of whom we will speake
something, onely to shew
that there have been scolds
of old as there bee now.
Some report that hee kept
two wives at once, the one
Myrtho, the other the aforenamed
Xantippe. And to a
friend of his, earnestly demanding
why hee kept two
such women at once, under
one roofe; especially being

scolding queanes, ever
brauling and chiding, and
did not beat them out of his
doores, and confine them
his familie? hee made answer,
These women teach
mee at home, the patience
that I must use in sufferance
abroad: for being throughly
exercised with these, I shall
be the better able to endure
the morosity of others.
Upon a time, when Xantippe
in the open Market
place had plucked his cloake
from his backe, and such of
his friends as saw it, said unto
him, Why Socrates do you
not correct this impudent
outrage in her, and chastice

her soundly for it? replied
to t^em, Yea marry, that
were a jest indeed, that when
we two be together by the
eares, all the whole market
folke looking uponus, may
cry, Hold thine own Socrates,
To him Xantippe: by
which meanes wee shall bee
made a derision to all men.
Another time, one Euthidemus
a Philosopher, and
one of his most intimate
friends, comming from the
wrastling place, S^crates
meeting with him, invited
him home to supper; the
meat being set on the table,
and they being in an earnest
discourse, more minding to

argue than to eat; Xantippe
being therewith very angry,
rose up from the place
where shee sat, and wished
them choaked with their
prating, if they would not
fall to their victuals whilst
they were hot, giving her
husband very bitter and
despightfull words: but they
by custome being nothing
therewith moved, talked on:
which she seeing, tipped up
the table over and over, and
flung downe all that was
upon it to the ground, and
so went out of the roome.
But when Euthidemus, being
very much moved therewith,
offered to rise up

and to depart the house:
Nay stay good friend, saith
Socrates, what harme hath
shee done? did not the like
thing happen unto you the
last time you bad me home
to dinner, when an hen leaping
up amongst us, cast
downe and spoyled whatsoever
was upon the table?
yet did we who were then
your guests onely laugh at
the accident, and neither
fret nor fume as you now
seeme to doe.
The same Socrates, after
hee had indured his wives
bitter railing in the house,
at last being wearied therewith,
hee went out, and sat

upon a bench that sided the
street doore. Shee at his departure
being much more
incensed, in regard of his
silence and quietnesse, as giving
her no more argument
to speake of; she presently
(seeing where he sat) went
up into the garret, and
poured downe a chamber
pot full of stinking water
upon his head: at which
those that passed by fell into
a great laughter; which
seeing, he laughed as loud as
they, and said, Nay, I thought
ve^ily, and was confident
thereon, that after so loud
thunder there must needs
follow a violent shower of

raine. But I have done with
Socrates, wishing that all
such as have the like shrewes
as hee had, might be indued
with the like patience to indure
them.
I come now (and that I
propose to be the conclusion
of this worke) to tell
you of a curtaine Lecture,
read by a vertuous Queene
to the King her Husband;
super-exceeding all the former,
and worthy the observation
and imitation of all
good women, of what estate
and condition soever. The
Historie thus followeth.
Amongst the Kings of
Arragon, there was one Don

Pedro (vulgarly Don Peter)
the seventh of that name; but
before his Inauguration,
Count of Barcellonas, who
tooke to wife a beautifull
young Ladie called Donna
Maria, daughter to the
Earle of Mount Pesulia, and
Nephew to the Emperour
of Constantinople; who
notwithstanding shee was
plenally furnished with all
the accomplishments both
of nature and grace; as knowing
that beautie annext with
vertue purchaseth praise
with immortality, and that
(as another saith) if chastity
and good name be lost, there
is nothing left in women that

can be praise-worthie; and
that she knew withall, that
true vertue was the beautie
of the soule, the grace of the
bodie, and the peace of the
mind; and that it might bee
said of her, as Seneca in Hercule
Furente speakes of Megera
the wife of Hercules:
Gravent Catenae corpu^, and
long a fameMors protrahatur lenta, non
vincit fidem, etc.Although my bodie be opprest
with chaines,And famine by a lingring
death constrainesMy wearie life, no violence
shall declineMy faith from thee, I'm
still (Alcides) thine.
Notwithstanding all this
goodnesse inherent to her
greatnesse, the dissolute
King, growing neglectfull of
his first faire choice, bends
his inordinate affections fully
upon fresh change. Hee
sleepes now onely in the
bosomes of Catamites, and
base prostitutes; whil'st her
company and consociety
is both at boord and bed
quite abandoned.
But the good Queen, lesse
troubled with the want of
his boord or bed fellowship,
than grieved with the dispaire

shee had of hopefull
and princely issue; knowing,
as Basil saith, that barren
marriage is seldome without
braules, she bethought
her selfe, how by redeeming
the one, she might recover
the other. And to that
purpose she dealt privately
(being wonderously for
her vertues sake beloved of
all) with one of the Pages
of the Kings bed-chamber,
whom he most imploied in
his private prostitutions, to
bring her covertly to the
Kings bed, to supply the
place appointed for one
of his best loved mistresses.
This was as effectually performed,

as considerately
plotted: so that the King
once more injoyed his
Queen, and was as prodigall
of those favours to her, as
he pretended to another.
The morning growing
on, and he now sufficiently
sated, hastens her departure,
both for his owne honour
and her credit. But shee taking
hold of the present occasion,
began to discover
her selfe in these or the like
words, and read unto him
this short Lecture: My gracious
Lord and Husband,
if I have offended you in
the fervencie of my love, I
here voluntarily submit my

s^lfe to the ty^annie of your
hate: yet if it please you
considerately to examine
the cause of my hither com^ing,
it was neither to
quench any immoderate desire
in my selfe, nor envie to
intercept any of those favours
you intended unto
another: it was not lust, but
love, hoping that this nights
unexpected passage may
blesse us with issue, and
beautifie the Kingdome
with a joyfull heire. For
why should strangers inherit,
where there is yet
hope left that we may have
of our own to succeed. Nor
will I leave your side till

you call into your chamber
some persons of honour and
^rust; to the end that if heaven
be so gracious unto us,
that royall fruit (by me so
much desired) may ensue by
this adventure, the world
by their testimony may
take notice, that it is legitimate,
to crowne me with
the name of an happy Mother;
and not adulterate, to
brand mee with the title
of a lewd and lascivious
strumper.
The King, though he seemed
somewhat troubled at
the first, yet better recollecting
himselfe, was not any
vvay displeased vvith the

Q^eenes honest deceit: but
presently called in two
Gentlemen of his chamber,
as witnesses of that truth;
considering it touched his
own honour as much as the
Queenes desire. The event
of this stratagem proved
fortunate, both to the Parents
and the kingdome: for
by that meeting she conceived
vvith childe, and according
to the season of vvomen
vvas delivered of a son,
on the first day of February
in the veere of Grace 1196.
The Father and Mother,
when the solemnity of his
Baptisme vvas to bee celebrated,
differing about the

name, they caused twelve
torches of equall length and
making to bee alighted at
once, they bearing the
names of the 12. Apostles;
with this omen, that the
name of that torch vvhich
vvas first burnt out, should
bee given to the Infant:
vvhich happened to be that
of S. Iames; and so was hee
called Iames, being the chief
Saint whom the Arragonians
celebrate.
He proved a rare and an
unparalleld Prince, as well in
forrain warres as domestick
government: he was beneficiall
to his servants, and
bountifull to his souldiers:

his courage vvas full of constancy,
and continued vvithout
change; proving such an
one as Socrates characters
for valiant. Great attempts
he undertooke vvithout diffidence,
and managed them
vvithout feare. Making invasion
upon the Mores, he
pierced vvith a great army
the Ile of Majorque, then in
their possession, and after
many skirmishes brought it
under his owne subjection.
Hee invaded Carihage, and
made his name famous in Africa.
He had a faire and fertile
issue, sonnes and daughters.
His eldest was Don Peter,

who succeeded him in the
kingdome of Arragon: his
second, Don Iames, whom
hee made King of the two
Iles, Majorque and Minorque:
his third vvas Archbishop
of Toledo. His eldest
daughter, Donna Tollant,
vvas Queen of Castile: the
second, Donna Isabella,
Queen of France: the third,
Donna Urracha, vvas married
to Don Emanuell Prince
of Castile. His sonne Don
Pedro espoused the daughter
of the King of Navarre.
Great pity therefore it had
beene that the meeting of
that happy night had beene
intermitted, in vvhich the

royall father of so kingly ^
progeny vvas begot. He lived
72. yeeres, and died ^^^ligiously,
retiring himself
to a sequestred life. For being
troubled vvith a gri^vous
disease, which ma^
him unable for governmen^
hee disposed of his scep^^
and estate, and expired in th^
City Valentia in a Monast^ry,
in the yeere 1266. abo^
the beginning of August.
I need not to have travell^^
so far for an history to (...)
purpose, vvhen our ow^^
kingdome hath afforded ^work^
like, betwixt persons of (...)
greatest quality, who by the
like sleight practised by (...)

forsaken Ladies, have not
^eene onely a meanes of re^onciliation,
but of happy
propagation and issue. Great
^hen hath beene the vertue
and patience of those noble
Matrons, to suffer such corrivalship,
in conniving at
their owne maid-servants
and Gentlewomen; considering
that (as Crates saith)
nuptiall faith is seldome violated
vvithout revenge. Besides,
there can be no greater
temptation to corrupt the
constancy and loyalty of a
married woman, than when
shee perceives her husband
to discharge upon her his
discontents and virulencies,

and reserve all his time and
consocietie for the person of
another.
Aristotle affirmes, th^^
man or woman is worthy
to be accounted stout, bold
and valiant, who doe no^
onely with patience, indu^^
injuries and rebukes of
fered them, but strive to
repay the best good for th^
worst evill. For patiencei
of such similitude, and nee^^
alliance unto fortitude, th^^
shee is either her sister or
her daughter. And thoug^
this vertue (as Cicero saith)
being often provoked with
injuries may breake out into
fury; yet in such distraction,

it is good for wronged
women, to thinke upon
the worst how to better it,
and to wish the best with
intent to further it, and
whatsoever shall happen
patiently to indure it. For
the onely remedy for injuries,
is to study how to forget
them. I conclude with
the Emperour Aurelius,
who tells us, that it is more
safety to forget a wrong
than to revenge it; to suffer
infirmities, and dissemble
mishaps: the one is the office
of a constant sicke man,
the other of a cunning
Statesman. But for a wife to
beare with the weakenesse

and imperfections of (...)
husband, is the true Character
of a wise and
vertuous woman.

Gaudet patientia Duris.
