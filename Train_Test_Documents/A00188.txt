the court of king JAMES after that I have resolve and with myself determine illustrious and thrice noble to a preamble wherein be brief discourse the cause of this treatise divulge and set forth unto public view somewhat concern the life of a courtier and have spend much most serious and incessant deliberation and constant consideration to who I may exhibit and present this offspring and tender infant of i the fruit of my labour at last I most fortunate think upon your right ho. lordship for which I most submisly crave your lordship pardon and most humble desire that you will vouchsafe to entertain so courteon a persuasion and favourable a opinion of i that I have not either with any impudence much less imprudence attempt aught herein many of my near and dear friend assure i that it will be worth the labour persuade yea constrain i by (...) this most humble present the (...) most royal king unto your honour in (...) you right noble lord for your (...) singular both internal and external virtue and endowement do most resplendent glister and shine like a most precious jewel rich garnish in the pure Gold therefore it can doubtless be impudency in i thus to endeavour and desire that these my labour may have your lordship worthy approbation who daily endeavour be most industrious employ in the negotiation of the profitable affair of your king and his commonwealth and to this end and purpose and for this special cause do I most prostrate proffer and present unto your honour this small volume (@) (@) title of the court of JAMES king of great Britain neither yet do I doubt but that this my labour herein will receive a grateful acceptation from all those who not so much with their corporal as their mental eye of intelligence do see and thorough see into the generosity of your lineage the great and most grave wisdom which do inhabit in so green and young a breast your modesty affability and great humanity a fig for envious critic therefore of most deject and degenerous condition who practise nothing so much as base and malignant to censure man person fault and infirmity but the judgement of the most judicious and just judge may give both (@) and all good man full content principal the great love and ^^^our of our most potent and prudent king who back gracious elect and make choice of your honour as a man most excellent most accomplish on who many other be neglect he may confer yea accumulate the favourable effect of his princely benevolence bounty and benignity this your honour lovely lot and felicity no doubt may bite to the quick and even as it be boil the heart of the malicious but good and honest mind man who be the lover and embracer of your honour virtue and integrity do contrariwise undoubted rejoice at and hearty congratulate the same thus have I I hope free myself from suspect of impudence now again if any accuse i of imprudency to avoid this imputation I thus answer that I undertake not this work by my own authority motion or instigation but as have be urgent solicit thereunto by the vehement persuasion of some worthy personage who themselves have observe diverse pamphlet touch the court to have be former publish which seem rather to have be compose in the disgrace of prince and derision of their follower then sound or sincere to instruct or show they what be to be follow what to be avoid I also for my own part do assure know that there be and have be both in our own and in the memory of our forefather such man who be as it be natural bear to pervert and deprave thing both well speak and as well perform who custom and counsel I utter detest and in this treatise do faithful protest that I have endeavour what in i lay to lay hold on the goulden-meane for what soever I have judge commendable I have according commend and what soever I have contrariwise think to be culpable I have likewise condemn which my impartial and indifferent deal herein I hope no good man no honest heart man will disallow as for dishonest (...) follow whether they praise or dis (...) herein neither I nor any wise man shall (...) ourselves hurt or take it to the heart yet this (@) confident avouch that if I have a intention to (@) over all thing that have be promiscuous and confuse both say and write by many man against courtier the court will I be persuade be most distasteful to many to who I know it be now most pleasant and delightful but this my little volume I hope shall be profitable to many grateful to the good hateful to none but to the impious and envious I do herein frequent admonish those courtier who have a determination to hoyce up sail and to launch out into the deep of this difficult and turbulent sea that wise and (@) they sail with a fortunate and favourable gale of wind lest by the sirenlike allurement or rather the most violent and tempestuous storm of immoderate desire they be desperate drive upon Scylla or Charybdis or be dash against the wrath and indignation of their prince as against a dangerous death-threatning rock these admonition have I for this cause think most pertinent and necessary because now a day almost all thing universal be full yea too-too-full of brazen face boldness and precipitate haire-braind heedless rashness doubtless young man yea all subject in general when they shall understand and consider the difficulty and danger of preferment and the burden of a courtier life will I be persuade less e^milate and hate either courtier or magistrate yea and these will hence learn better to rule and those to obey but enough of this it now remain that I endeavour to purge and put away one other note of imprudence in i to wit that too like unto Phaethon ambitious I take a task in hand who greatness with my weakness can stand if any do sound such a note in my ear and think thereby to deter i from my purpose progress I wish he to take this for his answer that I be not ignorant of my own call and condition of life which be private neither again be that unknown to i which be relate by Cicero of a certain Peripatetic philosopher who Hannibal have in derision call he a dotterel and a giddy-headed fellow that he be not afraid to dispute a bout military discipline in the presence of he so potent and politic a commander yet not withstand this seem not to i a sufficient important or just cause why I shall in this regard acknowledge in myself any imprudency or temereity this I say in modesty and humility that your honour may hold i excuse for the equity and protection of my cause now in controversy that I doubt whether Hannibal as great and egregious a commander as he be thus contemptuous disdain this man of Greece who notwithstanding that he never see the face of his enemy nor ever be in a pitch field yet deliver precept of martial prowess do not disdainful cast his eye upon and that with just cause though with barbarous arrogancy and haughtiness of mind do not I say behold and cast his eye upon those reason and rule what ere they be of that so excellent learned grecian for it be scarce probable or credible but that by the way he deliver somewhat which may mislike and displease so skilful and sound experience a captain and commander as he since that unless we will too much extenuate the credit of that old proverb which be sometime the blind may hit the mark it be therefore snapish and impudent disdainfulness yea beastlike and inhuman insolence in that carthaginian that that which he forsooth will not approve or allow of he must furious b^ndy and forth with reject but the issue and e^ent do evident declare that Hannibal be no (@) superexcellent or invincible a captain as that it shall seem undeniable that he can be admonish of any oversight in any warlike affair furthermore they who whole knowledge and experience of milita^^ discipline do whole consist in custom practice and exercise and be so opinionate that the power of wit and experience get and gather by industrious diligence from learned author write to that purpose be not of any moment or validity that one example of l (@) only mention also by Cicero in that book of he which go under the name and title of Lucullus may just refel and repel the opinion of such man indeed I do inge^^ously acknowledge and confess th^ the prince and principal furtherance to the performance of high action and notable exploit be that a ^an ^e as it be natural addict and adapt thereunto but yet believe i literature or learning if that of the (@) (@) in a generous and Her^il^^ spirit vimpl (...) do promote and much enlarge that (@) (@) and policy which be (@) and genuine in which respect if unto natural promptness and (...) ty learning and experience be associate then indeed may a man perfect perform any noble eminent and excellent act or employment but peremptory to avouch or affirm that man famous for their excellent part of virtue learning and intelligence can be able sound exquisite and considerate to discuss or discourse of even those thing whereof they never be personal actor and agent be doubtless the badge and cognizance of a ignorant and illiterate man yea of one who never know the majesty and excellency the light and delight of science and intelligence which antiquity be wont to call the muse nor as it be in the old adagy do they ever stand at the threshold to bid the muse good-morrow and Hesiod have leave this testimony in writing that he himself get all his knowledge and experience in navigation from these tutor and teacher but whither run all this prolixity even hither right Ho. this be the end thereof that your honour will vouchsafe to hold i excuse if peradventure as have be aforesaid I do not in its proper colour portray and delineate to the life that platform and similitude of the life of a courtier which either your lordship nobleness may require or those courtier may expect who in this point much time and practic experience the best schoolmaster may more firm have inform in the rule and custom of the Court but as for other hap what hap may when the die be to be cast and my chance to be choose I have rather with some impeach to my name write and say something according to my weak talon which may be true acceptable to you right honourable marquis then unreasonable or uncivil to be want in my bind duty therefore this one thing (...) submissive and earnest desire that you^ (@) will be please courteous to respect (...) heart most faithful and affectionate ho (...)ing and due reverence your venerable and noble virtue and that in your accustom courtesy you will favourable accept and protect this my peculiar dedication to your lordship of which your honourable favour I be most confident persuade who worthy and meritorious action not only towards your own country and kingdom be by the trump of ^ame blazon abroad but even your lordship manifold favour and benificent courtesy towards stranger also be every where extant which bless Britain with most due and deserve praise do publish and (...) lgate and even we that be stranger yea all neighbour nation both far and near do most worthy wonder at nor need I fear lest what I have herein write shall rather seem to savour of gnathonical flattery then reverent to love and embrace your honour noble virtue with true integrity for all that know your lordship excellency your so great gravity and temperance all I say which do near and thorough look into they do know that I speak but what be most sincere true and faithful final that I may omit nothing which may conduce to the accumulation of your lordship worthy praise the elegancy and graceful pleasancy of your honour behaviour be such and so singular that not only these present time but even succeed posterity will doubtless with a cheerful voice commemorate and immortalize the same and than this what great better true can be say this be it which have purchase and procure unto your Ho: the reputation approbation love and singular supportation of our most religious gracious potent and most prudent king whereby we may and that with very good reason most due and true here take up that verse as true as ancient virtue be more lovely much more acceptable proceed from a bersonage amiable but I stray to far time call upon i now to set upon the subject itself before I proceed to any other matter first then let the courtier or whosoever else which have determine with himself to bestow and dedicate his endeavour to the service of prince often deliberate and think upon this one thing that the court the court compare to a warfare in some sort do represent and resemble love or a warfare and lover we know will diligent remove every rub obstacle or impediment whereby they may content and please their belove soldier also do labour and endeavour with all care and diligence and make this courtier to soldier the mark whereat they whole level and aim namely to follow their captain or leader and as much as in they lie to do what he command so shall a honest courtier adorn and endue with wit and discretion bend and incline all his study and industrious endeavour not only with diligence to entertain his king or prince commission and command but prompt speedy and with all care and fidelity to discharge the charge which be commit unto he and he which lay this foundation of a courtier life shall doubtless (...) in the sight of his sovereign (...) (...) soever well nurture and generous (...) man will devote and consecrate himself (...) follow the court let he not present imagine or conceit with himself that he be to lead a soft delicate easy or calm kind of life but now must he learn to bear patient the court encumbrance yea to digest and swallow down many load much envy grievous contumely and malicious detraction assure it be no fiction I tell thou but let every courtier which do aspire and desire to attain unto that celestial and eternal court of heaven and which intend both constant and sincere to say and to do that which may be grateful to God and the common weal (...) address himself to this point to this resolution for that courtier be in a great error and very much mistake which hunt and hope for nothing else in the court but honour riches pleasure power and authority and long before he enter into the court (...) not serious consider with himself that even in these seem sweet and odoriferous rose of courtly delight full many thorn and thistle do privy grow up for if we do but judge and examine one thing by another and let truth take place we have both know and read of in the memory of ancient and modern time many noble and worthy man yea such as have exceed well deserve both of their prince and commonweal who in court have waste and spend the most flourish time of their youthful year with great praise and applause of their prince and all good people who not with stand all this have oftentimes even for trivial or small cause yea sometime none at all be most lamentable molest and with envy and detraction subtle circumvent yea which be more and most miserable have be either woeful deject and clap up into prison banish into bitter calamity or even unto death itself punish and condemn whereof that we may not wander far for example call to remembrance good courtier the memorable and remarkable example of such like doleful and unfortunate misfortune in papinian Comineus Moor Bussonus and innumerable more who name and fame as well for that they have most profitable speak and learned write as for their many employment very honourable perform be most excellent eminent and permanent we have especial in the court of the prince of Germany very many demonstrative argument and pregnant document hereof both ancient and fresh in memory which here I have rather wrap up in silence then with tedious prolixity too much wrong my courteous reader patience but yet I can by any mean omit or let slip that which at this present for the newness and late performance thereof be fresh and frequent object to the eye ear ambitious and perfidious and apprehension of all man namely the tragical of that great advocate statesman and stately courtier of Holland who be that Phaethon who for many year together be as it be the wagoner and Sterneman yea the king and keeper of all holland this be he who with the bridle of his authority and with a certain confidence or rather foole-hardinsse and presumptuous rashness do reign and restrain as in a chariot violent draw by force of most fierce horse the various motion and commotion of the mind of all man this be he who audacious and adventurous without due consideration attempt many matter by make as it be a confuse chaos of heaven and earth by confound and mingle sacred and profane thing together turn all thing topsy-turvy with a most impious and pestiferous intention will have wrought his commonwealth detriment and destruction but and that most just receive his own utter decay and worthy confusion what need many word this be I say that Phaethon who be the wagoner or coachman of the current and swift glide affair of the commonwealth of Germany and I say not that he be for his phaetonicall insolence dash out of his chariot and tumble down headlong into the river Padus by jupiters furious and sulpurious lightning but be by the just judgement of God and upright sentence of condemnation after judicial proceed convict and condemn at the Hague in Holland his high aspire head be cast down to the ground and his ambitious consult and insult heart receive its deserve final and fatal wound and thus this politic pilot and prince of Holland be tumble headlong from his chair of state who seek his country thus to ruinate I here let pass that other late and lively example which happen also in this famous kingdom together with that in France of that most factious and filthy italian a man most debauch in his whole life and conversation whosoever see not and consider not these I hold he to be even purblind and to have no smack or taste of wisdom or understanding in the least degree courtier than may learn by these exemplify reason draw out of these famous kingdom as out of the most spacious and specious theatre of the whole world how alternate and variable the vicissitude and alteration of thing be in a court and if not always yet for the most part that they which be puff up with excessive covetousness and inordinate desire of have riches and be violent carry away with the spirit of ambition be utter unmindful of those damage and danger which do begird and hedge in courtier on every side that they I say do but ride post and make haste unto some disastrous and sinister fate or destiny and in the interim while they thus repugn the sweet saying sentence and suffrage of the most wise and prudent they quite destroy the end of their desire and burn hope chariot with lust furious fire these and such like which only (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) we brief touch by the way lay hold on the utmost top as it be of these matter may every courtier reiterate and ruminate again and again in his mind and unless he have a heart well fortify and confirm to endure many evil inconvenience and misfortune let he forsake the court and betake himself to a retire and private life which also though it may have its own difficulty distress and scarcity yet if the reputation of most excellent and considerate man may have any credit or estimation with we nothing as they true hold be more happy or more bless then a private kind of life moderate and decorate with the golden mean and the praise of a private life mediocrity he than who portion or condition of life be neither too high erect nor too low deject but indifferent between both he certain if any thing in this wretched worldmay be term a a special and principal good-thing be the heir owner and true possessor thereof very elegant and eloquent have Politian paint out and express the tranquillity and sweet security of a countryman private life whosoever therefore do love to live the same to wit a free calm and quiet life I wish he to read and diligent to observe these his verse follow suusipse censor etalto which thus may be english o the rare riches of a shepkeards life o how much bless be he from storm of strife o how he live in peace and quietness free from annoy full of all joyfulness he fear no fate no hate nor foul deceit nor strive to be ambitious-vicious great he be guiltless guilelesse fearless he be most free his corn and cattle his rich treasure be to himself he life under nonce over-fight by none control perform his own delight with deep disdain he kick at gold and pelf and scorn honour thus content himself assure Politian thou do most true and egregious confirm that which before thy time learned and grave Seneca do also affirm in his Hippolytus concern a private life that be there be no life more free more void of vice and blame or in their rite the same which former time do see then that which sweetly' lead in field remote and far from town and hold of war where be nought but fear and dread the greedy hope of gain set not his heart on fire he harmless do desire on mountain to remain fawn flattery or common-peoples train which do good man disdain he whole do despise envy pestiferous can have no place in he no favour frail though trine make he ambitious he serve not to a crown nor his eminent in state he seek not vain renown frail riches he do hate and fear not fortune frown wherefore that we may be at liberty and void of all fear let we have this in continual contemplation and consideration that the sorrow difficulty and distress wherewith every christian in this wretched life be environ be manifold let we therefore with heedful heart conjecture and cast in our mind by what especial a remedy to avoid danger in the court. mean we may subjugate and overcome they be thou then kind courtier willing to receive a remedy against they then let this be thy sweet and sovereign antidote that with grave Cato you be of a honest and uncorrupted life and conversation that with invincible virtue modest bashfulness and innocent abstinence thou strive to get the mastery and to be good in deed rather than seem so to be whereby it will come to pass that by how much the less thou shall seek after honour and preferment by so much the more thou will undoubted achieve the same now all this while it be not unknown to i that it be a general rumour and report that there be not many good man to be find in the court and that according to the opinion of many few man do bring good art and science to a camp or a court and therefore some no doubt may say that I do but wash a aethiopian-blackmoore in invite and incite courtier to such integrity of life God forbid yet indeed I confess that it be extreme hard and difficult for one particular man alone at a delicious sumptuous and bountiful banquet at which there be extraordinary great provision of meat and drink to be sober and satiate and yet some one of a more sage and temperate condition than the rest may so moderate and discreet govern himself that he do not either in meat or drink exceed the bound of modesty and competent satiety even so kind courtier although in court thy virtue integrity and sincerity may be disquiet dishearten yea and that it may seem to live in exile or banishment yet if thy mind be well form and conform therein it will assure cause that among many fawn smooth-boote false heart flatterer and crooked perverse mind thou shall still be of a right and upright courage and condition yea and from this fountain thou shall derive all those silver stream and comfortable current whereby thy call whether courtly or otherwise though former obnoxious to grievous and dangerous defect shall yield back and repay unto thou gracious and prosperous effect if hereupon thou firm fasten thy anchor then fear no ship wrack but with unconquerable courage and animosity launch out into this and turbulent sea of the court and undoubted thou shall vanquish and overcome the infinite swarm of amphibious and prodigious monster of impiety which may make incursion and encounter upon thou therefore generous courtier start not back at these evil but step forward against they with a bold spirit proceed I say and put this counsel in practice and let not the philosophy of effeminate and fainthearted man distract or disturb thou from thy purpose and determination which of itself be most honest and laudable reject and cast from thou unprofitable and improbable speech and hearken to God the fountain of infallible and invincible verity itself in vescer be curse be the ground for thy sake in the sweat of thy face shall thou eat thy bread from whence we may infer and firm believe that every estate and condition of life whatsoever have in it the thorn and thistle of loss cross that no estate be free from trouble and calamity especial since this sentence denounce against man even from the world original be register and record in the book of God itself be most authentical be most undeniable true and faithful and be of every aswell private man as courtier to be according receive and believe now whereas many man of no mean rank and quality do learned magnify and with much wit dignify a solitary and private life as be the dispraise of a mecre private life former intimate they err exceed and be in my judgement marvelous mistaken which be of opinion that a private life be in itself happy and bless for if that be true which the most eloquent orator and excellent philosopher have leave in writing in the first book of his office according to the opinion of divine that be we be not bear only to ourselves but our parent country and friend do challenge unto they a part in our be then no occasion questionless whereby a man may deserve well of the weal-public can be want to any man so much as to they which lead a private obscure and solitary life live unprofitable to themselves alone be nothing at all beneficial to the commonwealth whereinto and whereunto they be bear and bring up he therefore which be by propagation and education generous liberal and free-hearted do right understand and know that true glory reputation and renown consist in virtue which also be especial illustrate and make famous by worthy and meritorious action and employment in a commonwealth so that Sallust that excellent writer not without just cause leave we also this his testimonial in writing pulchrum rei-publicae it be a very noble and worthy thing to do good to the commonweal furthermore let every courtier and honest man whatsoever consider thus much in his mind that to deny to dedicate and devote his best service to God his king and country be nothing else in deed than as if he will wilful expose himself to exile and banishment that true and ancient adagy which we frequent use do verify and ratify this truth (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) every good be that which distribute impart and communicate itself to other again (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) a good man as the say be be a universal good for shame therefore let we never praise or approve that mere imaginary and erroneous opinion that in those thing which be common and customary contingent to nature in general any man shall therein promise to himself beyond all other any particular or private felicity unless he can persuade himself that he be able by a certain incredible and unheard of magnanimity of mind to curb and correct all fortune and misfortune whatsoever wherefore let we never suppose that true fame or felicity do consist in a private or retire life which be both full of crafty fetch and fainthearted fearfulness no nor in the vainglorious brag of bag of gold and great possession but rather in the good and gracious constitution and condition of a man mind whosoever then frequent and follow the court let he careful and very circumspect consider these thing neither let he be lead to believe those sottish and unsavoury fellow by who silly advice or rather shallow devise such a kind of absolute bless life be to be desire and inquire after in seek whereof a man shall far soon forsake the world than find it in the world avaunt all such absurd and witless fellow of who I wish all wise man will beware and with the ingenious poet will sing unto they this their due ditty fool void vice the contrary commit like ship that escape gulf on rock be split but thou kind courtier which either art already enter or short intend to enter and adventure thy fortune in the court with a considerate and constant courage spurn at and despise those partial speech of the common people and wise apprehend and entertain the word of the most wise yea even philosophy and wisdom itself embrace this in thy arm as the the courtier must endeavour to get wisdom as his best guide founder and fountain of all virtue and as the sovereign salve against all corrupt concupiscence for this will conduct and instruct thou in the true knowledge of that which be just and honest teach thou what be to be follow and what be to be refuse out of this pure wellspring of perfect wealth thou shall draw out such true knowledge as shall cause thou perspicuous to perceive that too much dignity riches and authority be little better than the very hangman and tormentor of man mind be of wise man to be contemn and despise this and faithful mistress will demonstrate unto thou what a multitude of man do fond admire and much wonder what shall be the cause why they be so great and grievous day and night vex and perplex final he which be well fraught and furnish with the wholesome precept of philosophy shall in conclusion bring himself to the king of king and prince of all prince that be he shall be reduce from the unlimited and illegitimate worship of the creature to the creator himself and sure I think that he which be thus prudent and provident be not wise in the least degree for every christian courtier ought especial to take care and make a conscience hereof namely that he be so exercise in the court of his prince here that hereafter he may without shipwreck of conscience achieve and arrive at the haven of the heavenly court and kingdom of jesus Christ now then after the study of wisdom let not the law language eloquence courtier by any mean omit or neglect the study of law language and eloquence and let he especial bend his best endeavour to attain unto the prompt perfect and most commendable knowledge of history history and antiquity to which indeed I can sufficient move and admonish he for this knowledge be the of the time the light of truth the life of memory the mistress of life and the messenger of antiquity yea this same historical knowledge if we may believe Polybius be a most sound and sure direction instruction and preparative to all well manage of politic affair and be indeed a singular tutrixe and faithful informer how to abide and suffer patient the inconstancy and mutability of brittle and fickle fortune if therefore friendly courtier thou will not continual show thyself a child and non-proficient in the court of thy prince be not I say rude but well read and a skilful antiquary in history and chronicle thus the courtier be adorn and dignify with these wholesome precept and also fortify with God gracious aid and assistance and be lawful elect and incorporate into the society of courtier let he thus proceed and leave the issue and event to God who doubtless will direct and protect all his affair so fortunate and effectual that he shall with prosperous success wade over and wise wind himself out of all difficulty and disturbance whatsoever a rush therefore a straw for the witless word of unwise man the court be the stage and station of all ill let none come there who have a gracious will it be trash trumpery and mere foppery for as we have already specify he which will in this sense be good and godly must not only leave the court but even the whole world for if we love and believe if we nothing in this life be absolute good will hear and bear the truth be it possible I pray that any thing can be absolute clean and pure in this unclean and obscene scene of the world no no but be thou good courtier urgent and instant even as it be to strain and constrain almighty God by thy ardent and fervent prayer in invocate his divine goodness and say i i i i deuce deuce Fausta lord not without i by i be my guide thou guide all be well I guide I deadly slide again will live well live to God thy country friend that life be no life when lead to private Ends. and that one thing i be sure will health procure and with my credit stand a country-loving heart true tongue a all-assisting hand final let this most memorable verse also like and delight every courtier and honest christian in God almighty hand of providence lie all my lot health wealth inheritance what if the courtier also after this frail and transitory court serious desire and aspire unto the celestial court shall in pious fervency break out into these holy and heavenly word that be bless be the lord God my consolation and salvation my hope and help be in thou therefore will I not be ashamed now than the courtier be thus sound and sincere furnish and garnish with the fear of God and precept of piety and philosophy needs no long dread or be afraid of any iniquity impiety or gross enormity which like hideous Hydra or mortiferous monster the court may feed and foster but with a hardy and hearty courage to wit a blotles and spotless conscience and innocence and integrity of life and conversation may bold enter into the palace of his prince but whosoever not be as yet enter thereinto do honest and discreet desire to provide for and to forecast his own well fare and future felicity he I admonish that he be inquisitive and careful to seek out the court of a most potent prince or monarch rather to live in great cou^^s than of a infirm weak and less puissant king or kingdom and according to the counsel of the old proverb let he lean and trust to a strong wall yea and let the courtier no less wise and willing search out and desire to serve a most prudent than a most potent prince or potentate for this be a maxim as true as truth itself that the office and duty of servant be evermore adorn and illustrate by the honour and dignity of their master let he therefore be persuade that to live under a most wise and mighty monarch be not thraldom and servility but freedom and liberty wherefore he which find such a court to wit a good a great and a gracious prince a prince for his sound judgement and much experience most prudent and for his great dignity and authority potent and puissant I counsel and advise that courtier by all mean to follow such a king such a court. and and let not any fleet or fly tale so move thou as to remove separate and alienate thou from so good a prince if in the mean while any sinister distasteful or adverse accident oppose or oppugn thou bear it patient harden thyself against it industrious and constant and doubtless time will in due time demulceate mollify and mitigate those thing which former seem most obdurate difficult and intricate for even as a soldier in his kind of life and a mariner or seaman well season with skill for all season perceive danger as imminent as evident know which of they will prove most perilous hurtful and pernicious even so ought every courtier so soon as ever he have cast and contrive to lay the platform and foundation of a courtly life to see and foresee what in the court be hopeful what hurtful what be profitable what unprofitable yea what be seasonable and befit and what be unseasonable and unbefitting for they be fool and by no mean to be endure which will hope beyond and against hope that be be altogether anxious and uncertain do depend upon a obscure blind and hopeless hope let he then which be wise beware of this lest thus he lead and mislead himself and other and indeed how be it possible for he who with such vain hope bring himself into a fool paradise to order and frame his counsel and affair to a direct and desire end and conclusion let the courtier therefore with all convenient expedition endeavour and desire to know whither he be to settle his hope upon the rise or decline estate of his prince moreover let the courtier apply and bend all his power so long as he continue in the court that as much as in he lie he be very morigerous and grateful officious to his prince but yet so as that he do observance or obedience nothing with prick of his own conscience by obedience I here understand piety or a honest reverend and religious care whereby we heedful hear and dutiful finish and accomplish the commandment of one lawful command for what can such a man do or well perform which be not of a quick and nimble hear but be so dull and undiligent in understanding and apprehension that he do not right conceive nor be due and true capable of what be either command or demand be thou therefore good courtier very well affect to this virtue if thou desire to insinuate and creep into the favour and affection of thy prince think with thyself that there be nothing more unindifferent unreasonable or more void of discretion than for a man to desire to be reverence and obey by his inferior who himself be most wayward and undutiful to his own superior therefore he be sure a happy and fortunate man who unto his facility and easiness in hear and apprehend do couple and conjoin promptitude and readiness in perform but always with this proviso and exception that he undertake not to finish or effect any dishonest unjust or unlawful command whatsoever but let he kind and courteous entertain that excellent say of Aeschylus (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) obedience be the mother of felicity let the courtier then which right and honest desire to deck and adorn the form and fashion of his life in the court and to make his prince his friend and favourer as also to be expert and cunning in counsel himself and contryve all his action and affair let he I say diligent ponder and serious consider these thing but after that his labour have be with prompt expedition sustain and conclude since the estate and condition of courtier be very slippery and uncertain as they who indeed be too often and too easy circumvent and environ with the fraudulent accusation and malicious detraction of wicked man let the courtier therefore well and wise to demand his pardon shift for himself and provide a remedy against they let he I say in his first entry or ingredience into the court covenant or compact with his prince that he will vouchsafe unto he a general pardon and let he diligent take heed that this patent of his purgation be not by the necessity of the time subtle or violent take from he now as touch liberty and freedom in speak of liberty of speech which prince for the most part do take very distasteful I must herein also admonish the courtier because indeed they be but few which free and faithful do advise admonish and advertise prince thou therefore whosoever thou be which will show thyself not to be a counterfeit false heart or sain but rather a faithful servant to thy prince follow not so fast seek not so much the glitter splendour of fickle fortune and thy own private commodity as the truth which by no truth mean shall be conceal but honest reveal whensoever it may redound and be conducible to the commodity and honest utility of thy king and his commonwealth therefore thou be wise wise forbear to speak until fit time and occasion be happy offer unto thou hear what Solomon say to thou Mars and vit^ in life and death be in the power of the tongue wherefore be thou neither a futile or unprofitable babbler by unseemly loquacity neither contrariwise let thy tacitarnitie or secrecy be unhonest but just and ingenuous and esteem that silence necessary and sufficient for thou whereby without either contempt of God or the common good thou do retain and keep unto thyself those thing thou know lest they be disperse and spread abroad to the prejudice of thy prince or any other person but now that I may return to speak of the study of verity or truth whereof kind courtier I hearty desire what truth be thou will be a heartie-lover and wherein I wish thou not only a studious practitioner but a perfect proficient which that thou may the better understand I thus define verity or truth I take to be such a virtue whereby we speak of praise and promote any thing so as the person or thing praise or speak of be absolute of itself hence then be command that we speak no otherwise of any thing than as the matter be plain in itself but thou will peradventure object thou fear danger or despite thereby fear it not for it be far better and much more commendable to suffer death itself than either to oppress or suppress truth or good council and questionless a good prince do much more high estimate and value a faithful councillor though dead than a falsehearted flattererand disembler though alive for no vain counterfeit or profane thing can be of long continuance wherefore let neither the time terrify nor necessity dishearten nor wicked and malicious man move curb or disturb the good and faithful courtier from truth and honesty but with constant Socrates let he be still the same immutable immovable excellent say Cassidore concern justice justice say he know no father nor mother it know truth but make no difference of person it direct imitate God do thou the same kind courtier and that thou may come very near to the nature condition and disposition of God himself love truth and if thou desire that other shall speak the truth to thou do thou hate and abominate untruth in thyself but perhaps thou will say with the comical poet truth hatch hatred and what hatred I pray thou commedian do thou mean why man truth bring even death itself to that noble architector to papinian the lawyer to Socrates that famous philosopher yea and to many other beside what then shall we therefore maintain a lie against truth God forbid indeed it be true I confess it that truth be oftentimes abuse misuse trouble and torment yet for all this as Solomon testify the lip of truth shall endure steadfast for ever and Cicero in his oration for Caelius say Omagna etc. o the admirable power of truth which can most easy sustain and maintain itself against all the sagacity and most acute subtlety craft and collourable treachery of man brain or breast whatsoever esteem it then a great glory and grace to suffer disgrace for truth and verity then to receive much honour and present preferment for falsehood and flattery it may be the hatred which thou pretend that this truth will engender be with the vulgar sort or common-people well be it so yet assure among true and faithful friend nothing be more acceptable nothing more delactable than truth and sincerity if it be not embitter with churlish or uncivil asperity and improper or ill proportion with rigid roughness and severity which evermore shall be absent from amiable truth but I be the more willing incline more copious to inculcate and entreat of this virtue which since it can by any mean be keep in corner but will abroad into the light may not slight be glance at or light be pass over unto all these sound and solid argument some courtier may peradventure yet far object and say that it be dangerous all way to speak the truth in a court esspecial in difficult doubtful and intricate matter indeed I can gainsay it and I know assure that in such case a man have need of a more than vulgar or common with and judgement and that in such astraight exigent if a man will keep and conserve good will and reputation and avoid the infamous blot and spot of disloyalty he have now something to set his wit a work on go to then put case it be thus yet not witstand I will as God shall enable i take away the obstacle and remove the rub and scruple which may in this case seem to trouble thou of this than I first of all admonish thou that it be more correspondent and agreeable to wisdom and discretion always stout and manful to deliver thy opinion then with pusillanimity and unseemly fearfulness to hold thy peace and say nothing if the matter about which the question grow be absolute true and perspicuous apparent than I know thou be not move with it but if it be utter unknown to thou and more intricate than that thy present intelligence be able to wind into then thou make a demur and be peradventure at a nonplus thou may then with these and such like formal speech just excuse thyself to thy prince as touch this matter or counsel as a thing both profitable and honest I thus deliver my mind so far as the matter be manifest unto i as I conjecture as it seem to i so far as I can guess apprehend and understand these and such like form and kind of speech be honest use and modest deliver the prince may receive very sufficient content and satisfaction and if his counsel and consultation obtain not a happy and hope issue and event the courtier just excuse and purgation need not be to seek which also a gracious prince will doubtless accept and take in good part now it follow that we speak somewhat concern the deliver of our suffrage judgement and opinion in public serious and important deliberation and consultation observe this that in many other matter rash speech condemn delay be dangerous and unprofitable but here procrastination or discreet deliberation be very behooveful beneficial and comfortable beware therefore that with the hasty and furious dog as the proverb be thou bring not forth blind whelp and that thou be not too forward to utter any unsavoury unreasonable or unseasonable word which be indeed irrevocable have this also in frequent consideration and often remembrance that the entrance and beginning of all thing be at the first onset hard and difficult and even after the same manner the the foremost voice in all counsel and deliberation of importance be most hard and hazardous therefore he do wise which make one more wise than himself his precedent and precedent and discreet adhere and cleave to he and yet so as that he do especicial depend and rely upon his own opinion judgement and arbitrament not altogether upon a other for as almost in all other thing so likewise here he be not another man himself which counsel can so likewise the courtly counsellor in matter of moment in grave and great affair must be both eloquent and evident plain and intelligible that he may descend and come near unto the matter in hand and not with frivolous circumstance or superfluous circumlocution to go about the bush neither must he according to that old say wrest a interpretation hit^er and thither as if he will be the breake-necke thereof nor must he dissipate or spread abroad anxious uncertanity but even as become a sage grave and judicious man must precise and inexpresse term speak both of matter and man (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) in plain word call a ship a ship and a spade a spade furthermore here may arise another question as that if the courtier come into the court find other courtier at variance dissension and controversy among variance or dissension themselves whither he may partial take part with either side or keep himself neutral indifferent between both I answer that neutrality or partiality be rather to be flee then follow what then choose i out kind courtier he which be most wise most intelligent most capable of reason and understanding and this man even by the uprightness and equity of his cause will easy break the passion and power and allay and qualify the hot courage of his corrival and envious competitor to which purpose say ovid. the soldier cause erect deject his might which if unjust shame shake of force to fight even so do thou also join thyself to that party which maintain a just cause for as for neutrality as they call it we must so assign and define it that it rescue or redeem no man from the snare or ambush of his enemy neither do long keep or conserve loyal or faithful friendship let neutrality therefore go pick a salad as the say be but not mistrust or suspicion without which indeed a courtier can live let he not therefore be too credulous or apt to believe every one for although the old vulgar verse tell we that jealous man we see oftentimes delude be yet friendly courtier let not this much move or not to be too credulous molest thou but take heed who thou trust for in trust be treason and in this regard let every courtier be most curious circumspect and vigilant and what Homer require in a prince namely that he be quick sight and watchful (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) have eye both behind and before let the wise courtier I say prescribe unto himself the same rule and let he not inconsiderate light or slight put confidence in a glaver crooch and deep protest or swear friend if thou any thing at all esteem i hear and believe this from i else thou will soon or late repent that ere thou do trust a saintlike salvation and protestation let Epicharmus his wisdom be forcible and effectual in thou to trust none unless thou do so it be a thousand to one but that crafty Ulysses will at one time or other encounter choleric Ajax and thus thou shall be a debtor to thyself to condole thy own folly and to other also to laugh thou to scorn if therefore thou will cover thou with a shield against this sharp dart I admonish thou courtier and that most serious that thou neglect not this counsel for it will then undoubted confound thou furthermore in whatsoever court thou live let this also be thy care and a cautelous observation unto thou that thou strive not either to ascend too high or to descend too low what then beware of extreme and persuade thyself of the truth of that which the poet sing to keep a virtuous measure be sure pure treasure let then I say mediocrity golden rule which be (...) or a Mean^ so frequent so vehement press and praise and that most deserve by the most ingenuous and judicious both poet and philosopher be evermore thy love and thy delight excellent be that of one Pallas who thus wish .. o will I may be neither too mighty nor too miserable because indeed mediocrity or a mean be the most desiderable and delectable thing in the world and place of high honour do cause and procure the great danger and contrariwise experience itself which never deceive teach we true that a most deject and low estate engender disdain contempt and contumely they therefore be true wise which both say and do as phocylides do (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) I desire to be a indifferent citizen for many most excellent thing consist in mediocrity to shut up all in a word they which in all their endeavour desire to keep the golden mean live most sure most secure from fear of distress and danger such a soft and sweet kind of life therefore which Solomon the world wonder for wisdom seek and beseech of God give the reason of his request which be to a most honest and holy end as be excellent set forth pro. 30. such a kind of life I say if thou be wise I wish thou will especial desire and delight in and assure if thou greedy gape not after more or more necessary thing than be competent sufficient this may very well satisfy and content any man to live a honest wise and bless life moreover if the affair of thy prince call thou to the expedition of any great notable and important employment be not too high conceit or affect with of employment this honour or preferment neither be thou of opinion that thy reputation or authority can well consist in safety unless action of such consequence rely and depend upon thy performance avoid rather good courtier if I may advise thou by the example of other the too much intermeddle in the difficult affair and secret counsel of thy prince but so far forth as they be just and honest thou may under go they yet I say do not greedy desire to have the special hand in they for if those employment though never so great implicit and intricate do not gain and obtain a happy and hopeful issue and success than thou who build castle in the air have purpose thereby to have set up the plume of thy fame and renown shall contrariwise now become a grievous and egregious consumer and bankrupt as it be of thy former hope fame by a future happen shame now also as touch matrimony or marriage I first of matrimony or marriage of prince of all and especial admonish thou that unless thou be thereunto sole or single constrain thou put not thyself forward in such a business for we find it true by experimental proof that many man other be debar and keep out have be admit or rather have intermingle and involve themselves into the secret and matrimonial negotiation of prince as if they be the only ominous augour and solid soothsayer of nuptial and Marriges but have thereby even plunge and overwhelm themselves into great and grievous danger especial when the event have not fortunate answer the intent again let the courtier take heed in this respect and of humh (@) embrace the good counsel of Polypus which be that he high esteem sobriety and humility least be by any thing puff up with pride the prince do not only perceive but punish the same in that such a one will seem and be esteem more wise and prudent than his prince this be a infallible truth that prince indeed do delight in and love man famous for their learning virtue long ground and grave experience but they will by no mean admit or permit with a patient mind any whosoever that go about to promote and prefer themselves above he nor those who for congruential government be more high prize or praise than himself assure it have be in time past be at this present and will be in time to come most faithful true that a kingly throne or crown will near permit corrival or copartner there to sit but I speak not this to that end and purpose that all (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) all freedom and liberty of speech shall be take from courtier be both grave wise and understand man for neither be it befit nor do it stand with reason that they shall so low deject and abase themselves as either to allow and approve of the illiberal and servile opinion of other or themselves to speak unfaithful which absurdity and impiety if we will believe Plutarch be most worthy to be reprove and reprehend of all man let not then the courtier if a honest grave and discreet man fear the displeasure of his prince whereby he shall be restrain not free to deliver those thing which he have true and wise conceive in his heart moreover let both simulation and dis-simulation simulation and dissimulation in speech that be all counterfeit or colourable dissemble be far from the courtly counsellor whensoever he be to give his judgement or deliver his opinion concern any matter already propound let he not then so much desire to insinuate and creep into the favour and gracious acceptation of his prince by fraudulent cozenage unhonest trick or false tale as by virtue wit eloquence excellency and integrity with all which notwithstanding that he may be enrich and rich garnish yet let he not for this cause deride and laugh other to scorn or base esteem and vilify they nor so admire and magnify himself that by this mean he as it be pessundate and tread ^^em under his foot but what then why assure whosoever tread this path walk hasty into the highway of his own ruin and destruction which happy have not happen to any one in our or our ancestor knowledge and remembrance doubtless this same Philautia or self-love never make mention or motion to any goodness neither be it repugnant to reason and equity that he which only desire to please and content himself and contemptuous scorn and contemn other shall semblable be of other disdain reject and scorn furthermore kind courtier I will here admonish honest advice in counsel thou this one thing also that if peradventure by the authority of thy prince thou be to sit in counsel about matter of great consequence that thou serious and sedulous ponder in mind and strict examine whether the counsel or business to be then undertake in the name and right of thy prince be please to God profitable to the common wealth befit the fame and reputation of the counselor themselves as also easy and harmeles to be affect for those counselor do very bad advise and counsel their prince who many time be the special cause that they erect and build town tower trench bulwark or warlike rampire and such like little or nothing profitable to they and by this mean omit other more necessary and commodious in these and such like affair let the courtly counsellor be always most ready press to appoint such work as may be propice and profitable to his prince and country herein I say let he be very discreet and prudent in counsel as also most cunning and quick witted to display and lay open what he have delay discommend to that purpose in his heart excogitate for prince especial be of all other man most impatient of delay therefore to use delay or protraction of time and either by reason of the dullness of wit or slow motion and conception of the mind or else through want of mature judgement to procrastinate and put off from day to day business and employment of great importance and especial moment will not only be very prejudicial and obnoxious to thy credit and estimation but even to thy prince himself most unpleasant and unacceptable again let the counsellor or honourable ambassador not to discover secret mind and mark this that he be not too forward to divulge and make know the weighty and important affair commit to his trust and fidelity but what in he lie let he cover and conceal they until such time as they be effectual dispatch and conclude but if otherwise some with envy will speedy so prosecute and persecute thou as very much to hurt and hinder thy noble action or else other will not stick to accuse thou of remissness and want of wisdom that such and such business be not with more celerity and expedition perform be careful therefore without any rumour or noise speedy to strike the stroke of thy intend action year any man have time so much as to muse or think thereon furthermore I will here suggest and put into the to be always in action mind of the wise counsellor this needful and necessary admonition namely that like the sun he be always as it be in continual action that be that as much as in he lie he live not without employment this be the mean to acquire and get a noble name renown and reputation especial if he do speedy and fortunate officiate the affair of his prince now in the true and due deliberation and execution of such action let the courtier be hereof most advise careful that he wrap up in silence whatsoever may either be hurtful or not helpeful therein for in this case as the say be grau be great damage silence be commendable and detriment arise from undiscreet speech but commendable and comfortable be silence and secrecy for as babbler be in every business very unnecessary and unprofitable so especial in high great and important affair excellent therefore do that most wise king reprove and reprehend sutilitie or foolish babble pro. 20. keep not company with he which reveal secret that therefore which thou will not have another to blab do not thou thyself blaze abroad now after all this these subsequent consideration will to do nothing without the prince knowledge also deserve thy frequent meditation to wit that thou attempt not any thing though thou assure know it never so profitable without the privity and consent of thy prince especial if he be not far remote and absent from thou for what may he thence collect and conclude but that thou do contemn his princely prerogative neglect he not therefore by any mean neither determine any thing though in the small matter or most easy and commodious manner thy prince not be therewith first acquaint likewise if the courtier have commission to execute rule for a ambassador the place and employment of a ambassador let he not either by his own authority or by occasion of more commodious manage of his embassage alter or change any part of his charge therein contain but let to tie himself to the rule of his commission he refer all his proceed to the rule and form of his commission or else upon some new and inopinate accident let he speedy advise and consult with his prince for although it be determine and conclude by the civil law that sometime a ambassador may exceed the bound and limit of his commission if more ample and orderly the embassage may be execute than be therein command yet notwithstanding kind courtier that be not to be understand of public but of private affair that of Valerius may give thou satisfaction herein that the roman deliver their embassage in the self same word wherein they have receive it and that also of that most famous father divine Bernard be in this case worthy remembrance and deep meditation say he the true obsequious and obedient ambassador consider not what kind of commission or command he have receive be only satisfy with what he be command hear this kind courtier and perform the same and acknowledge thy prince lawful use his imperious prerogative thy supreme superior to who thou ought to be most morigerous and dutiful again whither thou be send as a ambassador orator interpreter or Ledger in time of war or of peace either for the present or for long continuance for parley or performance of any affair whatsoever not to undertake matter above his power thou must now most diligent enter into consultation with thyself and examine thy power and faculty what in such a case be thy ability or debility sound and substantial to effect and accomplish the same for there be not a great token of foolishness or fool hardiness than for a man to take upon he the execution of such a function or office as he be not able safe to undergo beware therefore I say and that seasonable that thou do not at any time affect or desire those thing which either thou know or at least shall know will be by thy impotency infirmity and debility most obnoxious most pernicious unto thyself or other be heedful herein I what be require in a ambassador advise thou and with a judicious heart poise and consider in mind the possibility and efficacy as well of thy body as of thy wit and discretion what thou be able to compass by thy wisdom learning and eloquence as also how expert and circumspect thou be to contrive any thing neither be it impertinent that I add the ability of the body for it be undoubted without all controversy that in a ambassador be require a fair and comely constitution of body that be such a external beauty and pleasant personablenesse as may be most amiable and lovely in the eye of his beholder for no wise man sure will gainsay but that even in the majesty or gracefulness of the body be a certain genuine and inbreed honour and reverence represent do thou desire example they be pregnant for we read that Alexander the great be most coy and disdainful behold by the queen of the amazon for no other reason than that she find not in that so potent and mighty monarch such beauty and comeliness of body as she expect in he who not able fame of admire deed of prowess have be from far bruit and divulge unto she very memorable also be that of the stoic Cato who deride and jest upon those ambassador of room one of who have a very foul and unseemly scar upon his head cause by a blow with a stone the other be lame the senate of room say he have send a ambassador which have neither head nor foot here also lest we prove a most thankless and ingrateful a brief memorial of that most memorable queen Elizabeth posterity let i step one foot out of the way and add one more as a personal pattern and lively example hereof how great and gracious heroic imperial and specious majesty be in that most magnificent and royal Elizabeth so long as she live queen of this famous and flourish island our neighbour the low countryman germane french itallians spaniard and polonian know thou well o thou never sufficient praise princess yea I say the grecian and barbarian ambassador hold it a especial cause of exceed great reverence only to see thy beauty and no less than a admirable wonder to hear thou speak but of thou thrice noble princess in who body and soul be seat and settle divine grace and majesty what can I say without thou save only this that so long as any state and condition of mortal man shall remain thy name and fame shall remain and fresh flourish neither shall any age or posterity smother up in silence or cast into the pit of oblivion the worthy praise of thy majesty gravity and magnanimity which be most illustrious garnish and as it be varnish with unspeakable and unheard gracious courtesy and affability farewell then thou celestial and imperial princess the most excellent and eminent phoenix and favourer of learning and all virtuous art and science thou be now bless ascend from this momentany and temporary court into a heavenly palace into that place where thou now enjoy eternal joy without annoy or bitterness and everlasting quietness without all care or disturbance thou o angelical sanited soul year thou be old be careful to live well that when thou be old thou may die well we also in the interim while here we as it be creep up and down on the obscene scene of this wretched world do all of we bend our course thither do all haste and run to that goal but what do I whither do I run by digress too far from the end where unto I intend my journey I must therefore now return from that court to this Court after all these thing which we have admonish and demonstrate to the courtier let the courtly ambassador do his best endeavour so to dispatch and perform his embassage and so discreet to order and dispose of all his several action therein that he may not impudence or (@) to be avoid in a ^^mbassador with many other before he fear that Legato the ambassador have no face that be he be such a one as be not a shame at any thing he do therefore kind courtier that thou may be gracious in the acceptance both of thy prince from who and to the prince to who thou be send be by all mean furnish with a quick and nimble wit that thou may answer subtle and eloquent together with a certain gravity gracefullnesse and delectable sweet utterance both to say and do matter premeditate or not premeditate with solid polish and acute judgement for many time beleeive i such accedentall matter may in thy employment be contingent and fallout as will not admit delay nor time for consultation let the courtly ambassador or orator observe and mark this also that although eloquence in speak be not to be too rhetorical very excellent and commendable yet not withstand he must discreet moderate his speech from too many rhetorical gloss and figurative illustration I deny not but that such like paint amplification be as it be the most beautiful light of a oration may have their most pertinent and exquisite use in the school temple and seat of judgement but not before a prince let therefore thy oration or speech to a prince be elaborate and well fraught and furnish with grave reason and pithy and substantial sentence rather than with the weight of word only a pure simple smooth and plain speech be certain most please to a prince and contrariwise a intricate coullerable and curious contrive speech be most displease furthermore let the ambassador be well see in the to be expertin the language of that country whither he go ambassador language of that country or kingdom whither he be send but especial in that which he may understand the prince to who he be send be most delight withal the latin tongue undoubred be very acceptable every where wherefore let he be most skilful therein that he may be able to speak it most prompt familiar and exquisite thou hear not any Nicepherus speak to thou who most in considerate will have a man learn perfect all language neither can I be persuade that of Mithridates be true that he be ever able to speak 22 several language but we here do only and especial persuade unto a idioma or most proper form of speech again it be not so much desire in any ambassador to be a good historian and Antiquary that he be a mere philosopher as that he be a excellent antiquary and well red historian for thing to come be for the most part like unto those which be already past and perform which a ambassador must also know as be indeed a politician unto these foresay caution I add temperance which temperance in a ambassador very requisite also I as a special ornament recommend to the courtier or ambassador prudent consideration send I pray thou friendly courtier into perpetual exile or banishment all the unreverent rabble of inordinate lust and desire which be indeed at utter defiance and open war with temperance and reason if thou be invite to banquet or feast let amoderate and indifferent provision of meat and drink satisfy content and please thou let thy sermocination or conference be sweet and pleasant and the good will and cheerful acceptance of the guest be hearty and faithful and be not over come with wine or strong drink for what soundness of wit and discretion can be in the head brain or mind of that man which do as it be stuff glut and gorge himself with immoderate denoured meat and drink neither be it to be imagine that Circe do metamorphize the companion of Ulysses into swine by any other mean than this which her sorcery or witchcraft as the poet fain can take no effect upon Ulysses himself he be a sober satiate and moderate man let the courtier observe and heedful mark this least by too indulgent freeness and forwardness to drink be by the fable and false tale of other prick forward and provoke he take such a fall as may utter overthrow the high build of all his former credit and reputation these thing I can hearty desire every courtier will at all time careful ruminate consider and recogitate but especial then when as ^^e be to have audience and to deliver the sum of his ambassage to this purpose let he think upon xenocrates who be by the athenian send ambassador that he may not in cur the the least suspect of intemperance be say that he will never so much as touch or taste any the least quantity of meat or drink until he have utter and deliver the effect of his ambassage honorius and Theodosius the emperor be of opinion to be acquaint and to reveal the secret of the place where they be ambassador that it be not fit to search and pry into the secret of foreign king yet in my judgement I can see any just reason why it shall be unblamable in a ambassador if when he be return he know and make know those thing which may seem and that most just to appertain into the commonwealth I mean those thing espicial which belong to custom religion Nationall law situation of kingdom castle city raiment ornament of prince condition of counsellor original family power possession or riches form and fashion of architecture or building and such like for what can be more disgraceful to a ambassador than when his prince do question he concern those thing to find he ignorant of they the great part whereof or at least the (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) that whereof himself be a eyewitness he may easy have understand and have have ample information let the courtier be the first in persuade his prince of dismission of ambassador that he will be please notwithstanding that the ambassador for diverse reason may be distasteful unto he yet both royal and magnificent to respect and entertain they and to give they a gracious and princely hear and with a large and liberal reward to dismiss they that they may not have any just cause to complain of his parsimony ungentleness and inhumanity the ambassador and courtly counsellor must not of the dispatch of a embassage by any mean be remiss in his affair and yet let he be as fearful as hopeful of the prosperous issue and event of they lest be only lead with a precipitate confidence of good success he do the more negligent and careless put in execution the charge commit to he in his commission let he also in all other matter hate and avoid curiosity curiosity and not excruciate himself with care for those thing which he ought not for as Plutarch testify (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) curiosity be a vile and servile vice or wretchedness therefore though in court curiosity tickle and entice motion be pleasant and delightful yet let every discreet honest and wise courtier neglect and reject it let this caution also be careful imprint in the mind verbosity and memory of every courtier that in his speech he express more prudency than verbosity and with the most sage and grave to be brief and compendious in the handle and dispatch of any his action and employment whatsoever for there be nothing can be more irk some to a prince nor in deed to any other prudent man than to listen to those man which like a mighty flood of word or a empty barrel do make a huge sound noise without any soundness of judgement or discretion who be as the countryman say of the nightingale nothing but word and wind moreover let the courtly counsellor observe that when he (@) (@) or intend any matter of moment opportunity with (@) prince he careful watch a ^it opportunity and that he begin the same from some new grateful (@) which he may think will delight or give content to his prince but if at that time his prince be exercise about other serious affair let he desist and wise watch a more seasonable and convenient occasion how much opportunity be available Pindarus in his pythies do excellent declare (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) time say he in every thing have the supreme place let the courtier therefore know and know assure that such be the validity and efficacy of time and opportunity that it be able to translate and transmutate that which be honest into dishonesty profit into dis-profit and a good turn into a shrewd turn and the contrary final time be able to alternate and quite change the face fashion and nature of any thing this do Solomon that most wise king understand and teach pro. 15. and serm^ a man have joy say he by the answer of his mouth and a word speak in due season be most excellent but enough of these thing now to the matter in the undertake and handle of any public employment let the counsellor have a especial respect a fourfold caution and regard of his honour and dignity which he may safe provide for by this fourfold rule and direction maugre all the malice fret and fur of all his envious enemy first of all let he endeavour what in he lie to live well and well to understand the truth which be a most luculent and evident argument of sapience second let he administer and give good and wholesome counsel to his prince which be a point of prudence three let he both desire and endeavour that which be good unto he which be a property of justice four let he delight to do good which be a token of constancy and perseverance and he certain which be arm with this quadruple shield or target shall not easy be over throw from the height of his honour and dignity but kind courtier in every deliberation and consultation inconvenience which appertain to public business consider well whence either great or lesser inconvenience may arise and make choice as the chief of that determination whence the small discommodity do accrue and which come near to the law and write word of God let the courtier settle his abode here as in a most exquisite smooth and plain way namely that he meditate and muse on the most excellent thing that he speak the best and but few thing that he execute and perform the most singular and substantial thing and these all such as may be most honest lawful and beneficial either to the church or commonwealth such a man as this may easy be discern to differ from the form figure and similitude of a servant or slavish vassal neither shall he be of necessity constrain to take all he needs from the casket of a woman nursery not to rely too much upon other or from the brain and invention of some courtly chaplain for what have near relation to the condition of servant and bondman than mere to depend and rely upon simple woman or ecclesiastical courtier in courtly affair what be more base and abject than lest we shall be deprive of our office and preferment to consent and subscribe to the opinion and purpose of other though never so wicked or unequal yea and that sometime in matter of religion and salvation oh woe oh shame alas what pen what tongue be able to express how shameful gross and grievous it be that a man shall thus mancipate and beslave himself to other that whatsoever wrong and injustice they allow we must approve whatsoever impiety or dishonesty they affirm to be good we must say and swear it be so let courtier in this case call to mind that notable and remarkable example which theodorick Afrus have leave as a pattern to posterity who command all such gnathonical sycophant to be put to death say if you be not faithful to God how be it possible you can be faithful to man mark this I pray thou good courtier and thou whosoever thou be who heaven have advance to I know not what sceptre palace court kingdom and empire he certain which be not faithful to God or by such deceivable and fraudulent mean get a crown or a kingdom have undoubted subject scarce faithful and a kingdom scarce constant or durable to he and in stead of renown and I know not what majesty which he seek for find nothing but a mere shadow smoke and vanity ay of set purpose here let pass a most terrible and lamentable example which alas not many year since do true teach we and the very fact itself of the murderer do apparent prove to be most true which (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) we do but touch by the way for to desire either to rip up or rub over a fresh the memory of which say most sad example be to do nothing else than to renew our grief sorrow and lamentation and to touch that ulcer wherewith that most prodigious monster of man have strike this whole christian orb yea we and all good man with a most detestable unhappy and unlucky blow but to the purpose fly o fly I beseech thou good courtier this infamous blemish yea this dishonest and dishonourable stain aforenamed seek not dainty delight by such dangerous endeavour to uphold the nobility of thy ancestor do not too high extol or magnify thy pedigree and the smoky image of thy progenitor neither do thou vain glorious brag and boast of thy valiant or victorious deed of chivalry true it be thus the glorious renown and fame of thy forefather be a true and unextinguished light to posterity and to speak with crispus suffer not their good or evil action to lie bury in oblivion yet hear and believe this one thing which I shall tell thou since all man have nothing but dirt and slime for their first and great grandfather as well they which lofty and haughty brag and vaunt it out in purple and scarlet robe as they which be press and oppress with poverty and sickness as well they which with wide mouth ostentation do crake and boast of stately statue trophy triumph and consull-ship of their ancestor as those who have most private penurious and very hungry lead their life in poor countrey-cottage do not therefore proud and disdainful glory in thy grand father or great grandfather eminence but if thou desire to mount and to surmount other excel and exceed they in honesty and integrity of life and conversation let thy nobility original and foundation be found and ground on virtue whereof assure it be far better to have be the first author and occasioner then either be well begin by other to be overthrow thereof or at least to arrogate and vindicate the same unto thyself by disgraceful frowardness untowardness and petulancy let then I say thy deed be more worthy than thy word and show not thyself such a idle or unmanly noble man as only to vaunt of voluptuousness ease and idleness which thou have especial get from the many worthy employment of thy generous industrious and virtuous progenitor these thing kind courtier though I thus object unto thou yet be it not my mind or intention to counsel thou that in the narrow strait of fortune thou shall debase or abuse the noble lineage of thy honourable ancestor by subject thyself to slavery or baseness but that thou shall endeavour by all virtuous and laudable mean to conserve and keep it inviolate unspotted and undisgrace and not suffer it ignominious to sink into the pit of black oblivion or utter forgetfulness here again take heed to thyself that either by haughtiness pride and haughtiness of mind of mind or pride of life thou do not exasperate and provoke to anger other man more noble excellent and eminent than thyself and so kindle the furious flame of fiery wrath and envy against thou especial israise from a plebeian and most mean estate thou stretch out and extend thy plume so far as to excel and surpass the noble and most renown man of honour and nobility chief if thou attain to this height of honour and celsitude by mere grace and favour or as some sometime do by illegitimate and dishonest stratagem not by famous fact or meritorious achievement let not therefore the immodest or immoderate care and eager desire or rather ardent fire of overmuch ambition withdraw thy mind from modesty from equity neither enrich or ennoble thy estate by hook or by crook by right or wrong will thou courtier win a kingdom or gain a crown then hate hot lust and base covetousness yea will thou enjoy all thing than I say thirst not after covet not any thing hear and believe Seneca that famous philosopher and excellent schoolmaster of man life this be a kingdom to refuse a kingdom when thou may reign as King final if thy mind provoke thou to inordmate desire let that of Lucan in his first book revoke thou the imperial and impartial fates-decree that high throne shall ruinate be but since all thing which now seem old have be all thing have their beginning and end new and do not once want their original and first be let no wise and discreet courtier hate or emulate another for the honour which he have late and that deserve get and attain unto for if thou land or commend any man for his riches dignity and prosperity thou praise such external matter as not be a man own but as the philosopher call they the good of fortune be therefore due to fortune but if thou extol and magnify a noble man who be of singular part and excellent qualify a great scholar pass eloquent famous for counsel at home or conquest at war here then indeed thou do praise the man himself and nothing but what be his own let such a courtier that he may the better maintain his honour dignity and nobility be a man of most exquisite carriage beautify with sweet and delicate constitution of body his ornament of apparel very honourable rich and sumptuous for if that be true which Homer say a man rich clothes and sumptuous ornament add no small honour to his high descent this indeed be in some sort true and befit every man but especial he which be attendant at court now to these external ornament let he add the magnificence and nobleness of other thing which as in all other so especial as Aristotle testify be in a noble courtier most convenient to be provide otherwise he lose the reputation and renown of his magnificence and excellency furthermore every courtier must in the court carry of behaviour about with he a cheerful countenance a tongue slow of speech and a heart that can as it be imprison and lock up his secret but let he especial take heed of ridiculous or wanton gesture for what can be more absurd fond and foolish than in conference to use mimical and idle behaviour wind wag and wrest the body to and fro like a vice or fool on a stage whereby beyond all gravity and decent sobriety they seem to jet or dance up and down cast their heel hand and foot hither and thither and look another way as if they be talk with some other these thing as they do very much deface and disgrace even the best speechee a man can deliver so be they most patent and apparent argument of a light and unconstant mind which none sure but even a mere sot or one that have not so much as one eye of understanding but most certain know to be true again I here advise every courtier that if at any a caution time he desire to shun and avoid the danger and displeasure of his prince indignation that he suffer not his office place or dignity to be take from he by any other than by his prince himself for doubtless it can but be very silly and absurd for any man to expect a remuneration and recompense from any other than from he to who he desire and endeavour his labour may worthy be approve therefore I wish and advise thou kind courtier that thou be not always not to be too frequent with or absent to long from thy prince present with thy prince nor too long absent from he do thou desire to know my reason it be this the one procure hatred and wearisomeness of thou the other cause unmindfulness and forgetfulness of thou be not therefore I say so absent from the presence of thy prince as that he utter forget thou neither do thou so often and importunate intrude thyself into his presence as that thy person prove irksome and ungrateful unto he but that thou may to thy special benefit and with his favour and affection be absent from he thou may labour to compass and procure such favourable and honourable embassage as thou may imagine observe and perceive will be grateful acceptable to thy prince by this mean though absent in body thou shall be still present in the heart and affection of thy prince and as a new and late entertain favourite may with joy and alacrity comfortable return unto he let the courtier wary and blameless learn patient of envy to bear contemn and set light by envy and hatred and let he in the interim both say and do whatsoever be just and equal for by this mean as sure as what be most sure it will come to pass that thou shall undoubted foil and fall thy enemy and envious emulatour what ere they be also let the courtier most assure persuade himself hereof that envy do not so much harm to the party envy as to the author thereof or party envy but by all mean have thou a care that thou thyself hate and repudiate this most odious and shameful vice in thyself which assure proceed from no other fountain or spring nay rather from no other sink or muddy pit than a loath some and savage motion and disposition of rancour and malice most true therefore be that greek elegy translate into latin envy most just do himself destroy hurt his own heart procure his own annoy thou courtier than whosoever thou be that be sick of this envious disease break the fury vanquish the fellnesse thereof I advise thou for as a vessel which be musty and unclean at the first do quick and most easy putrefy spoil and defile whatsoever good liquor or moisture be put therein so a mind vitiate and contaminate with this shrewd lewd and dishonest disposition and inclination to envy can never pure possess perfect quiet and tranquillity wherefore either let the courtier neat and pleasant frump and flout the bite and despiteful speech of the envious or else as wise and witty retort they as they be malicious dart against he but never let he with violence or vehemence repugn or repel they especial if they proceed from a prince primate or principal man of authority for it be wisdom with patience to endure and suffer not to revenge and reprove that which can be otherwise alter let courtier also understand and know this that envy be as it be the common pestilence and infection of a court which as it be connative with man so do it with man either among they of equal or inferior condition arise and grow up notwithstanding kind courtier do thou desire a preservative against it and to have a salve to heal this dangerous sore I desire thou at least to abate and extenuate it by courttesie graciousness and affability if in the mean season any chance or mischance befall thou by the envy of the impious and ungodly think thus with thyself that all man can at all time continue excellent and eminent for in short time many may be erect to the top of preferment and the same man be as sudden deject to the depth of distress and calamity and those especial which live in prince palace for can any man possible be so ignorant of this our human case and condition the condition of a couru as not to know and to be undoubted assure that courier according to the will and pleasure of their prince be sometime happy sometime unhappy sometime mighty sometime miserable what if this shall come to pass which also be a human casualty and in a prince as he be a man excusable and to be endure namely that without any great respect of judicious consideration he magnify and lift up this or that man to the high step of honour and dignity or contrariwise that he vilify and thrust down to the very bottom of baseness a man famous for his noble lineage virtue and literature and who merit have be most meritorious in the common wealth thou may hence I say learn friendly courtier by this and such like to endure that which thou will hardly approve yet fear and forbear to censure thy prince if thou mean not to deceive thyself for so far forth as he be please to use his own princely power and authority let his will be thy rule of justice neither let the old or new example which happen in Germany France and Polonia put any other meditation and consideration into thy heart but let this the prince will the couruers tule just and upright law satisfy and content thou let the pleasure of thy prince settle firm and confirm thou wander not far than this I advise thou if thou be wise it may be some subtle violent and immoderate motion of the mind may dissuade and persuade thou otherwise but I say still let reason and experience rule thou and judge not that to be rashness or dishonesty which seem to thy prince right and equity for sure that courtier which by this mean suffer shipwreck in the sea of the court shall as the proverb be Neptunum accuse Neptune unjust for as the mariner which once or twice have suffer shipwreck on the sea if when he approach near danger he strive not to avoid they want not opportunity and fit occasion have enter into the sea again to fall into and dash himself upon the same misfortune after the self same manner that courtier which have suffer diverse and sundry sinister mischance and disastrous slip in this slippery way and unconstant favour of prince have no cause to promise to himself any certainty nor can he in such violent and turbulent overflow flood assure unto himself a calm sea or a sure and secure seat I mean a peaceable and content mind furthermore kind courtier if thou have resolute resolve and determine to undertake any large progress course and continuance under thy prince enforce thyself to the uttermost of thy power to express thy promptitude promptitude and industrious diligence in thy office or call for as rash malapertness and disobedience do hurt hinder yea and utter break off courtly proceed so assure obedience prompt and ready press observance and diligence do commend promote and advance the excellent endeavour of a honest courtier let the courtier also which desire and aspire to honour and preferment by his prince have this care and due to be exercise in his prince presence consideration that as much as ere he may he be ever occupy and exercise in his prince sight that he may take notice of his diligence yet let this be do very seasonable and not too importune let he therefore in this respect observe the most seasonable time for usual sudden and unexpected employment be imminent and to prince which they for the most part will credit and commit to their dispatch and performance which come next into their presence let the wise courtier also observe and note this that to prefer thing present before future thing always he prefer thing present and not perilous before future and fearful thing if so be that which be good and honest do not prohibit the same for he which put not a period and just limitation to his rove and raven lust and desire or prefer future thing which many time prove bitter and distasteful before thing present greedy gape after new office and employment do seldom or never gain much thereby but like Aesop dog while they covetous snatch at a double doubtful commodity they most common lose their single certainty wherefore I again and again exhort the courtier that he herein be advise and that he lose not certain for uncertain thing for to use a measure in our desire be a special point of wisdom and modesty and not to buy our hope at too heavy or dear a ra^e as Terence his sannio well and witty do admonish we let we also know thus much that although young courtier be for the most part very rude and foolish insolent yea in many thing much to be reprehend yet they not be gross defile with any heinous offence or capital crime be therefore in some sort pardonable and to be excuse for it be good that every one shall have this in due consideration sin from our birth have all our heart possess he then which have least sin be bless and best if then in that more licentious life which for the most part courtier do enjoy in a court there be over much and immoderate looseness of life and conversation it be better but no far than we may with a good conscience in some measure wise to excuse they than by put oil and fire together to disquiet and trouble they with ignominious and bitter speech let we be guide with this rule through the whole course of our life that we may what in we lie have peace with all man and wage war only with their vice now in the mean while even those courtier which as much as they be able do cover and conceal the outward appearance and demonstration of their inward condition and inclination do notwithstanding soon or late break forth and discover what be in they so that they which with so great care and circumspection will have cloak and keep close what manner of man they be have at length in one vice or other be open detect let courtier therefore in this regard look to themselves and although they may fond say and so say deceive themselves that no man see or can witness against they yet let they know and know assure that the all-seeing eye of God knowledge do as it be through the looking-glass of heaven present behold and discern whatsoever the heart of man most privy and private conceive wherefore it can nothing neither greatness nor privacy of place can hide our sin from God at all profit or avail the courtier to be great in grace and great favour and authority or to seek out the most retire or solitary place that may be whereby he may the more eager and convenient without disturbance or discovery think upon and put in practice the high displeasure dissimulation and other private motion and machivation of his mind God I say who as the prophet testify be searcher both of the heart and reins see and foresee all the most secret thought and intention of thy mind neither be thou of opinion that the impious imagination which thou have excogitate and ruminate in the depth of thy heart though in most secret and obscure place if against the express rule of God word and truth can ever have a good end and prosperous conclusion thou may peradventure occasion be offer broach they abroad but either wrath rage dissimulation or faction and such like will assure cross if not utter confound thou for it be as true as old a say he which dig a pit for another fall into it himself so likewise after the same manner he that pull down his neighbous hedge be oftentimes by deceit as a lurk serpent sore wound if not by his venomous and mortiferous sting sting to the death so I say they which or invent any treacherous destruction to their king or prince not only because they contest with one more mighty be themselves confound but especial because God himself have command that the majesty of a king be as it be his representation and vicegerent on earth shall be hold most holy and inviolate and that he therefore will so sure and severe be the revenger of such impiety as a admonition to perfidious traitor and bloody jebusite that scarce any I say not gracious king but even graceless tyrant shall be peradventure destroy or supplant by they but that after the same manner a like revenge shall be retaliate and pay home into their own bosom think upon this then you courtly politician ambitious swashbuckler and blood suck traitor which think to shroud and shelter yourselves under the most holy and immaculate name of jesus it be not your solitary or retire place it be not your cozenage and equluocation it be not I say the authority of your great high priest or the dignity of a cardinal no nor the feign and false vizard of your catholic apostolic re^^ish religion that can make such evil to be good it be better yea I say it be far better if perchance thou be expel from the presence of thy prince or remove from thy due dignity and preferment not only to cover not to revenge our own wrong^ and dissemble thy injury and greivance but even patient and with a content mind to sustain and endure they neither shall any wise or understand man nor any that have the fear of God before his eye think that he may just revenge his own wrong and either in word or deed intend or attempt any thing that may redound to the prejudice of his prince furthermore thou kind courtier which be a man not to be rule by woman and bear to be of a manly spirit and disposition suffer not thyself to be over rule by woman especial simple and ignorant woman for nothing almost can be to any man more wretched and slavish then to abase and indignify himself so far as to obey the rigid rigorous and many time unjust command of imperious and impetuous woman whereby indeed he do no better than apparent seem to neglect reject and refuse that honourable prerogative wherewith God his all bless creator have from the beginning honour he now come we to lay down some few direction and instruction how the courtier may carry himself in the change and alteration of a king or kingdom as in all other thing so likewise in this a mean be the best how to carry himself in the change of a prince wherefore a new prince be inaugurate and invest into his crown and kingdom show not thyself too sad and sorrowful nor too glad pleasant and joyful what then hear and make use let thy countenance be modest and grave and when thou may without harm to thy credit and reputation temper thy joy with some tear of sorrow and sober and discreet intermingle some sigh and lamentation with thy present obsequious observance when the courtier perceive that his prince in his benign bountiful and liberal disposition be forward and ready to confer and bestow upon he any honest and princely proffer or present pay of ready money let he use no delay but with all celerity and expedition let he yet with a honest mind and carriage receive and accept of it for assure it be far better to have in present possession than to hope with long expectation and once teen teen be better than a hundred time cape cape the courtier endeavour to compass a courtly of the prince liberality life and be promote thereunto must give out and report abroad that he do not so much gain the same by his own proffer service but rather that that his office or place of preferment be confer and impose upon he by the especial and free election and choice of his prince for thou be by this mean admit and place therein may deal with thy most intimate friend as touch thy prince or his administration and employment always direct thy word to such a sense as that they may not malicious be wring and wrest to the worst if thou be not careful herein it be likely that one subtle Ulysses or other will circumvent and intrapp stupid and hasty Ajax and thereby shall thou grieve thyself and make other scorn and scoff at thou let the wisdom of Epicharmus therefore I wish thou be thy wisdom especial in prince palace to trust no man for it can be wisdom or discretion in any man to put confidence in courtier reward gift and fair promise because indeed many of they will seem even to load those man with rich gift and present only out of mere pride of mind and vain glorious ostentation to who notwithstanding they bear intestine hatred and rancorous displeasure and what then why even those will counterfeit and dissemble that they rejoice at thy prosperity and welfare whereas indeed they envy the same and do inward grieve when they seem outward to smile neither be these the trick of courtier only but even of the whole world which indeed make those that desire and look for that better life in heaven to despise and hate this here on earth and who indeed that have any spark of grace or be possess with any contempt of the vanity and villainy of this present life be not ashamed to think that he can gather fig from thistle grape from thorn or pure wheat out of dross and Darnell but I proceed and here admonish the courtier that he beware of those dignity and preferment which by reason of too eager desire to bring his friend also into office and promotion be a great hindrance to the better performance of his own proper and peculiar affair beneficence be indeed a noble virtue whereby we according of beneficence to our power do assist and do good to those which be worthy the same to our power I say because it be not fit I shall water another man ground i own be dry and thirsty for perfect charity begin at home let we therefore be very wary and careful that our good deed ill place prove but bad deed which certain then come to pass when we immoderate and unlawful seek the good of other and bring thereby much harm to we and we wherefore let the courtier yea every one take heed that when he stiff intend to do a pleasure to his friend he do not as great or a great displeasure to himself and those which appertain unto he but if thou have a desire to enlarge thy own estate be most sedulous therein especial when thou shall perceive thy enemy or emulator either drowsey or lazy dispose to sloth and idleness or follow their own lust and pleasure or busy exercise about toy trifle and vain sport then be a fit occasion offer thou which to neglect and not to lay fast hold on be exceed great folly and imprudence yea and then also not to confront and oppose those thy adversary but to the prejudice of thyself or other be a apparent token of gross and egregious negligence and inexcusable carelessness they which tread this path they I say which follow this counsel shall not I be confident persuade have need of any ungodly and indirect mean or project to solicit and suggest their prince that he will incite induce and win those their enemy who by no other devise or mean they can resist or remove to marry their kindred and ally that by such unequal and subtle slight and shift of affinity they may ruinate and overthrow thom. when the discreet courtier shall perceive that he have what the courtier must do when he have inconsiderate displease his prince inconsiderate and unadvised displease his prince let he without all delay by all the best mean he can study and endeavour to mitigate and assuage his wrath and indignation for assure displeasure and injury do to prince do take a far deep impression in their heart than one will think they can if therefore in the mean season thou do not expiate and pacify their conceive anger they will find a time most lamentable to lay open thy final and fatal confusion again if by negligence or imprudence thou haste provoke thy prince to displeasure against thou endeavour a atonement and a reconcilement into his grace and favour again either by price or petition make such personage thy friend who thou know either for their place or person can do much with he such be for the most part his ally his wife mother sister daughter and such like all these and each of these as much as may be let the wise courtier by his honest life manner and meritorious demeanour make to be oblige and link in love unto he whereby the courtier may safe sail through the danger both of Scylla and Charybdis or any other courtly storm or tempest whatsoever but after this if he perceive that for the redintegrate favour and friendship of his prince he be prosecute with envy and malice let he then again take heed of his emulatour or enemy for the continuance of a new reconcilement into the grace and favour of thy prince will again most easy and most vehement exasperate their hatred and despite towards thou moreover since it be the order and observation of historiography that we therein especial set forth and commend the truth of thing do thou also good courtier if thou will be true politic follow love and embrace the same do the consideration of the time persuade thou otherwise and ^^uite and incite thou to fabulous and feign matter then for forbear to write history for it be far better to desist from such a labour than with shameful imprudence or impudence either by flattery or forgery to blemish and wrong the reputation of thy name and credit and indeed it be very conducible to the good of the common wealth not to commit any thing to the peruse of posterity but what we have even by experience itself sound and assure find faithful and true he which do otherwise that be which do not place the love of truth before his eye respectless either of good will or hatred may indeed sell smoke for a time but at last shall perish himself like smoke rude and ignorant be those courtier which condemn that learning and eloquence be excellent in courtier and dispraise the study of eloquence and other most excellent art and science this doubtless be most true that there have be in all age political courtier most illustrious and famous for their learning and eloquence such idle drone therefore be not by any mean to be hear much less credit no nor the base and ignoble opinion of the common people who disallow of and much discommend man excellent part nobleness and renown who original be derive from a most honest and honourable foundation have spread abroad many admirable effect to the health and prosperity of all mortal man this be it good courtier to wit learning and discipline which comfort the comfortless make the fearful fearless which bridle and pacify the seditious and make rude rustic and uncivil people both gentle and courteous these and such like noble fruit and effect of learning and eloquence if courtier will wise examine and consider they can not choose but utter detest and cast away so hard and harsh a opinion of so excellent thing and will free and ingenous confess and acknowledge the excellent and wonderful efficacy of rhetorical eloquence commotion among the common people how to be appear and by who now as touch the vehement concitation of the multitude or common people this we must hold and believe for truth that they will spare no man though never so noble or eminent a courtier and which also be not seldom they be incense and inflame with fury even against magistrate and man of especial place and authority wherefore let he which be wise give way to fury and a uncivil multitude but to the appease hereof and pacification of tumult and outrage those courtier be most fit who for their excellent part and art be most affect and reverence by the vulgar sort who indeed since in the court they be rare and seldom see be therefore with so much the more care and diligence to be elect and make choice of but in the interim the speedy mean to suppress a sedition be that the courtier with all expedition cut off the head of commotion and not by procrastination or too long delay to permit they to a great and more dangerous head and augmentation and in such a case let the wise courtier show himself very civil and courteous of behaviour for questionless thou can not by any mean more assure or speedy win the heart and affection of the common people than by gentleness and sweet humanity wherefore let all (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) all rustical or rude churlishness be far from he yea let all peevish and testy frowardness be banish whereby a man do most bitter and grievous contradict other and utter many thing with unseemly wrath and indignation let he call to mind the counsel of Solamon and Ling^^ (@) ^^nfringe^ by patience will a prince be pacify and a soft answer put away strife that also of p be very pertinent to this place if a thing demand be deny with courtesy and gentle behaviour it come very near to a good turn wherefore let the courtier by all mean so accustom himself to a civil courteous and most gentle demeanout that it may seem habitual in he let he also here remember that he put far from he womanish altercation unbeseeming a courtier all womanish altercation or chide for many time it fall out that woman quarrel and contention do set both their husband and neighbour together by the ear therefore I say let he beware thereof and in any case let he take heed that he seem not to strip himself as it be and to doff or put off a manly courage and condition by wrangle about effeminate trivial and idle occasion and although as oftentimes it fall out many courtier courtesy and humanity be descend of honourable parent age have as it be by inheritance high and haughty spirit yet for all this let they incline to a more humble courteous and noble disposition than to be so busy intermeddle in litigious and womanish chide and brawl wherefore let every wise courtier shun and avoid all kind of strife and contention whatsoever as also all private and intestine dissension of subject one against another which assure do most common bring no small damage and detriment not only to the adversary themselves but even to the common wealth let then these three bond or chain even when great disturbance and discord be raise bridle deter and terrify every courtier yea any whosoever from do evil namely religion shame and punishment for in good sooth I be of opinion that the courtier or gallant whosoever he be do no better than gross abuse and utter cast away himself who by this threefold cord will not be restrain from do ill nor constrain to true obedience and due performance of that duty which may just be exact from he in court also he who word and deed do not agree to be faithful in promise be not to be trust no though he swear and protest never so deep but a wise and religious man will always be as good as his word and let the wise and understand courtier again and again consider this that it be a most shameful yea in many respect a most abominable thing which also Sallust lament in the man of his day etc. to have one thing hatch in the heart another thing coin upon the tongue not to estimate and value amity and enmity according to their true property but according to commodity and rather to carry about with we a fair face than a faithful heart o but do thou kind courtier fear and forbear these thing and desire rather to be than to seem to be be careful also herein namely that thou be faithful to be faithful in deal to other if thou will find other faithful to thou for that man in my judgement unjust yea fond and false complain he be deceive who himself do first deceive other as for example there be unhonest mind courtier who peradventure desire to displace their enemy and that no doubt many time under a colour of high and great preferment will seem to praise he for his learning judgement and virtue that thereby there may be commit unto he some great and heavy charge and office than former he have where his employment and affair be much more dangerous troublesome and intricate than before now what if thou in like manner that thou may untie one knot by another shall as subtle circumvent and ensnare such a like adversary with as crafty and sly stratagem as his own and so shall retaliate and repay his deceit with deceit craft with craft what if against a ensnare and dissemble enemy thou make simulation thy safe shield to protect thyself and deject he what if in Crect thou play the cretian yet understand i not amiss kind courtier I lay thou not down rule to deceive and cozen God forbid I shall but even as physician by poison do wise expel poison not to hurt but to heal the sick and disease even so when I here object unto thou small and innocent wile and subtlety I intend they not for the ensnare or abuse of other man but as a opportune coverture and protection of thy own estate and fortune and final I only urge it to this end that if occasion be offer thou may repay craft with craft and recompense the malignant subtlety of thy enemy with serpentine fallacy furthermore as touch matter of great moment what be to be do in doubt full matter of moment which we can apt and exquisite unfold or lay open to our prince we must demonstrate and declare to he those thing wherein custom and much use have make he most familiar and best acquaint make choice therefore with all care and curious election of such a one who be faithful to thou who thou know well and do assure thyself be free from flattery for assure as the ordination and institution of a courtier life be most ancient so be flattery a inveterate and venomous evil both to the court and commonwealth yea this evil if we will believe Curtius be perpetual it do often more private harm to the welfare of a prince than a warlike open enemy can do true it be a thing very much to be lament that so many worthy man so honourable bear so abundant in all wealth and prosperity that a court or king can afford shall notwithstanding all this utter banish from they amiable verity and most free give entertainment to falsehood and flattery for certain to speak the truth with Aristotle of flattery the chief and most sage of all the philosopher in his four book of his never be there more know which with familiar speech and smooth behaviour do so hunt after the grace and favour of prince as in king court there whosoever follow the court do usual approve and praise all thing at their own pleasure think and judge that it be not fit they shall trouble or molest those who they always flock about and be daily feed at their trencher hence I collect and not without just cause conclude that flatterer like impious imposture be most worthy of hatred for while this most pestiferous kind of creature do thus carry themselves flattery hinder the office of sincere friendship all sincere office of faithful friendship be utter forsake who special property among many other be to admonish and be admonish to do the one free without bitterness and to endure the other patient without resistance which friendly office while they be thus entertain they be sincere and faithful do and friend hereby do not easy run headlong in sin and wickedness but be contrariwise sweet and seasonable reduce and preserve from gross inormity example I know more clear illustrate and confirm the truth tell i therefore I pray thou kind courtier what make Nero so cruel who be so gracious educate flattery that be that most filthy and slavish sin whereby for his belly palate and Lucre sake he as it be sell himself to the perpetrate and commit of any most atrocious and inhuman impiety whatsoever what make Caesar rebel against his own native other effect of flattery country flattery what make rehoboam a tyrant flattery what need many word be it not extant in history that Dionysius his flatterer do call his cruelty justice and equity do not the flatterer of Assuerus as be specify in the sacred scripture cry out and say the wrath of the king be upright and just but peradventure thou will object and say a courtier must have a cloak against every wind that blow indeed I hear it and it grive i that I hear it yet I can hardly and in truth very hardly deny and gainsay it for courtierr have need to apply and confirm themselves to all occasion and to the condition of they with who they live to be subtle and crafty both in their genius and disposition and more mutable and variable than Proteus himself but here I must entreat the reader that he will not entertain such a thought of i as that what be now to this purpose say or write be out of any envy peradventure I have write somewhat too free which if so yet true it be free from all malignant bitterness and indeed if we will consider one thing with another who be he that know not that there be those in a court who at the first sight do seem to have in they much gravity literature and singular humanity and yet for all this be deep dive into and narrow observe be know under these beautiful and spetious outside and vale of virtue to cover and keep secret the deadly poison of flattery and with good reason for the court be the flatterer stage or theatre wherein he still do practice to adapt and fit himself to all assay excel Polypus far yea and the chameleon in change of colour and mutability of condition endeavour to enlarge and amplify his pomp and power bring Commodus the emperor to his utter overthrow yea many other have by this hellish enchant poison of flattery infatuate and final ruinate many mighty monarch potent and powerful conqueror of kingdom and nation but that I may brief contract all in a word that of Gnatho have especial residence at the perfect picture of a flatterer court that be whatsoever they say I praise it if again they deny it I praise that also do any one deny a thing so do I do he affirm a thing I do the like to be brief I can so carry myself as to flatter all and why o this be now a day the most thrifty kind of life this be assure the true picture of a courtly life and condition this be the most beautiful behaviour of many if not most courtier whereby without all controversy or contradiction we may take up that of ovid. the truthless troop of flatterer proceed from court of king and there they breed and feed all this not withstand be thou kind courtier which intend to lead this life a lover of honesty justice and integrity we deny not but that flattery may have his harvest and for a time may reap his commodity in the Court but this again I say with a most constant and immovable persuasion and assurance that the commodity acquire and obtain by flattery be always for the present most odious and opposite to true credit and reputation and will undoubted in process of time bring deserve discredit and defamation let all courtier therefore eschew this Scylla and Charybdis which sure all that be wise and intelligent will do consider that no counterfeit thing can long continue let that courtier take great heed to himself who present insolence and arrogance hope to have honour heap upon he for his arrogant and vain glorious pride and presumptuous insolence yea rather let he carry and behave himself more submiss more lowly for hence shall accrue and arise unto he a twofould benefit and commodity first he shall be sure thereby to continue the respect and favour of he from who his hope of preferment be derive second he shall by this mean be free from that common pestilence I mean envy wherewith the court of king be ever infect moreover let the courtier be mindful hereof that all worldly dignity and honour be most frail and transitory especial in court let that also be have in frequent and serious consideration which Cicero leave not only to courtier but to we all by how much the more eminent we be so much the more lowly and courteous we shall carry ourselves let therefore I say proud ostentation and insolent arrogancy be far and final expel and banish from every courtier and let he not attribute and ascribe too much to himself overconfident but rather anxious and doubtful attempt the high thing and when the courtier have by his prince bounty gratitude or thankfulness and liberality obtain any benefit or commodity let he set apart all proud ostentation and vain glorious selfeflation make know and tell abroad by who bounty and benignity he receive the same and he must by all mean endeavour to retribute all condign thankfulness to he alone for the same for it be very unjust and unindifferent for any man to seem to have achieve and derive that though never so little from another which have only flow from the fountain of his prince favour now furthermore as touch money he that know of money and covetousness thereof not how to use a measure in the have and crave thereof let such a courtier be expel the court as have unclean hand and a corrupt heart for can there be any present good hap or future good hope in a greedy covetous man he as Sallust say never endeavour to tread the path of truth and equity because as he be altogether unfurnish of all good science and honesty so be he total fill and fraught with craft and mere knavery avarice be expert in the trade and study of finger money which no wise man will immodest desire or seek after and with great reason for this as be imbrue and whole infect with deadly poison do make both the soul and body of man most degenerous foul and effeminate it be always infinite and insatiable it be never abate by plenty or poverty worthy Sallust thou say most true and wise indeed for doubtless as gold be try by the touch stone so be man try by gold what then can thou expect from a courtier dedicate and utter addict to a insatiable and greedy gape after gold and filthy gain in whosoever this be find be sure to find these also to wit hardheartedness a trouble mind violence craft and knavery treachery deceit rapine disloyalty and what if we hereunto add with that excellent orator solemn that there be nothing so sacred sovereign or solemn which avarice do not violate and extenuate I deny not but that it be honesty and discreet providence for any man to provide and furnish himself with all useful necessary for he and he but have we not see and know that these have be by many courtier get and gain with a foul spot and stain conscience by such I say who never have learn wise to limit the unlimmit bound of insatiable covetise wherefore be most assure persuade hereof kind courtier that if thou multiply thy riches and amplify thy fortune by the ruin and wrong of other man thou will not spare nor fear to be injurious to thy country prince and near or dear friend and though king and prince the estate and condition of thing so require be most liberal and bountiful to this or that man pay unto they and confer upon they most large stipend and rich revenue yet be not thou good courtier so avaritious mind as to desire and endeavour to wrest and violent as it be to extort from thy prince his wealth and treasure whither he give or deny what thou desire hear and make use of this counsel and wholesome admonition which that I may more perspicuous and evident illustrate take by the way this short example I suppose that no man be ignorant that even at feast and most sumptuous banquet there be always some one or other which be not so respective entertain as the rest so be it in court wherein some have what they hope for othersome leap short of that they long and look for let courtier consider this not the new upstart or those which be late initiate into the court but which have spend and bestow the great part of their age in this kind of life and then I doubt not but they will ingenuous and free confess that what we have herein say be most infallible faithful and true let the courtier also indefatigable strive and endeavour to be industrious and diligent that he may not seem to his prince idle lazy or too remiss and negligent in the speedy dispatch of business and employment for such a servant certain will he not vouchsafe and that deserve so much as to look upon hold he no better than a troublesome burden or a unprofitable drone and as not worthy to live among industrious laborious bee wherefore let the courtier be careful to express himself profitable and ever ready press to perform what he be command let he I say show himself a laborious bee not a idle drone sleepy dormouse or pernicious wasp in his prince palace now I make no question but that courtier be and indeed with special good reason as chief appertain how courtier may become wise and politic to they very inquisitive and desirous to know by what mean they may best acquire and attain unto courtly wisdom and policy I therefore thus answer both the courtier and politician namely that the knowledge of they both be thus especial obtain by much read frequent employment long experience process of time travail into foreign country wise dispose diligent observation of the life and condition of man and final by wise contemplation of kingdom court and commonwealth now whosoever be gracious and egregious furnish with these shall not only in hope be profitable to himself but also in deed most acceptable to his prince and whatsoever courtier shall have purchase this prudence to himself shall assure find himself intentive and ready prepare for all occasion offer and indeed to say the truth without fit opportunity even virtue or whatsoever excellency may consist in any courtier yea in any man what ere he be do pine lanquish and lie dead in he moreover let the courtier endeavour by all possible mean that by some honest office or other he show himself love respective of all prince so that they be not his enemy who he be most near and necessary oblige unto otherwise he will be contemptible and hateful unto they and if he can perform office of observance to all yet at the least let he not contemn or disdain they and let he wise avoid and free himself from the suspicion thereof for in such and so manifold change and chance of human affair he which to day be great and mighty may sudden sink down and a mere stranger succeed he let courtier therefore weigh and well consider in mind that even the short hour of man life can alternate change and overturn the low and high thing topsy-turvy true I can sufficient incite and stimulate courtier obsequious pliantness to the exquisite and ready performance of due and true pliantness and humble service for this be as I may so call it the bait and bird-lime whereby he undoubted purchase and procure to himself the favour and affection of all man and once gain firm keep and conserve the same to this purpose that noble historian Tacitus say true by how much the more ready a man be in obsequiousness by so much the soon shall he be raise to dignity and nobleness excellent also say Austin and obtemper be what can be more unreasonable than for a man to desire to be reverence and obey of his inferior and yet himself to neglect and disobey his superior therefore let the courtier like a soldier ready at a instant to give the onset to battle be most prompt and ready prepare to put in speedy execution whatsoever thing be give he in charge but ever with this law condition and consideration that what he be command be not dishonest or illegitimate for such undiscreet facility be unsufferable and most culpable both in courtier and all other man whatsoever furthermore the courtly politician must prefer the a public good to be prefer before a private public prosperity of the common wealth before all his own private commodity affection or injury whatever they be yea and must in this respect no other wise estimate his private affair than he will a nut shell or asmall lock of will and to this purpose let he here take by the way that verse most ancient and true publica private be a public good must evermore take place before a private or peculiar case now he which be possess with so honest a inclination may hence learn to brook and bear with many molestation and gripe grievance until he happy arrive at the haven of his hope and have hit the mark he aim at namely until he patient and peaceable ascend the right and direct step unto honour and desire dignity but let he especial in all his action and attempt check and correct the fire of fury and heat of his hot affection not to be furious and choleric for it be far more fit and convenient to do what we intend when the choleric heat of the mind be cold or quench then in the hot spur heat thereof wherefore let the courtier very courteous take heed lest his unbridled fury force he violent from temperate reason and constant moderation either in right governance or due observance in his account and employment the end and reward of which eronious temerity or rashness be shame and late repentance moreover let the courtier heedful endeavoure to follow the ensample of a ingenuous generous soldier to propound unto himself a pattern for imitation who intend to imitate some noble and victorious captain in the war frame and confirm his quality and practice his fortitude and magnanimity as much as in he consist to the similitude and equiparation of his leader or commander even so what courtier soever desire to excel or to be excellent in any thing let he wise make some worthy eminent and excellent courtier his pattern for imitation and study and strive to follow even to a hair as the proverb be his honest and laudable art and exercise this course shall the courtier see and observe to be most succinct and compendious whereby he may exceed much and in a short space promote and propagate his fame and fortunate affair now as touch take of revenge although the of take revenge court especial do oft time minister fit occasion thereunto when the state and affair of thy foe may be for diverse reason in anxious and sinister case and condition yet not withstand a honest and true generous gentleman shall then especial curb and correct himself for it be a foul shame and gross absurdity in any man that be honest and honourable bread and bring up by wrathful revenge to perpetrate any heinous and unhonest action most unbeseeming his birth and breed let all courtier therefore know and know for certainty that such be the vicissitude alteration and mutability of man mind that although fortune smile upon a man his good like flood flow into his lap yet let not his wrath and rage seem as it be now present to break prison and to range a broad but let he wise tame and temper the same with the bound of moderation and with the bridle of wit and discretion let he curb and keep in the same for to pardon and forgive be to a wise and worthy man the best revenge and it be enough for a man of a true and noble spirit not that he take revenge but that he can revenge ovid. in his 4. Trist. elegy 5. confirm the truth hereof at great spirit though provoke be soon appea'sd their noble heart soon move be soon please the lion leave the corpse that lie prostrate and when foe yield the fight do terminate but wolf and bear and other beast most base spare not to spoil the corpse in die case therefore I wish that every courtier or who soever else that have a vindicative or revengeful mind will call to mind and consider these thing for many time as be manifest it have fall out to great and very famous king that either they have stand in need of the favour and friendship or else have be force to fear the fury of even the mean and most base peasant wherefore it be not good no true not for those that not to provoke to anger be more mighty and powerful to give occasion of discontent or displeasure to any in court but now adays this be the common practice among man that as the proverb be the thread be ever break on the weak that be where the hedge be low as our english proverb be the cattle quick tread over it neither be it be it or ere will be any new thing but still fall out most true that may overcome right and the weak go to the Wall and this be also as true as gospel that he which live with one more mighty than himself have need many time out of mere necessity to yield up unto he that which indeed be his own right yea though he never have commit against he the least discourtesy or injury that may be let the courtier therefore take heed that he displease not nor provoke to anger one more potent and powerful than himself again those malignant and malevolent courtier be false and slanderous accusation to be detest abhominate and out of the court to be utter extirpate which study and endeavour by false feign and impious accusation of mischievous deed or treachery to hurt excruciate and incarcerate a honest honourable and harmless man a man that be a true lover of learning virtue and piety such nefarious factious fellow which struggle and strive to trouble a common wealth to supplant the good and to hold the sceptre of all sovereignty in their unworthy fist do most common link and knit unto they a knot of such desperate knave as former have thirst after glory and dignity yet can not by virtue and the king high way that be by discreet or honest course acquire the same or grow great in the common weal let every courtier that will be wise flee the company of such catelines and that speedy for experience itself do true tell we that such seditious swashbuckler do very often yea most customary receive the wage and reward due to such deed of impiety and what be that marry a miserable lamentable and tragical catastrophe or conclusion let the wise courtier also be slow to believe and not not to rely too much upon nor hope after courtier promise overhasty to hope neither let he take and interpret all thing in the best or in the worst sense yet seldom shall he be deceive if he believe but the least part of those thing which be promise for let he ever think this to be true that in every kind and condition of life it usual come to pass and most common in the court that each man be a Craessus promise have store but in performance who be not Irus poor let not such a court too much content and please the to beware of too much licentiousness or liberty courtier where without controlment man may too licentious and contemptuous upbraid one another with dishonest defamation wrong one another with contumelious detraction gnaw in piece if it be possible the fame and reputation of magistrate decease and taunt and tear in piece the credit of their fellow officer yet live he who hap it be to live in such a court and will not as much as he be able honest and speedy relinquish and abandon the same such a man I judge not worthy to be hate but much to be pity and commiserate in the expedition of his prince affair let the courtier perseverance in diligence with all constancy and courage press forward the perfect and final performance of those business which be commit to his charge for it be a matter of nothing to begin a work fortunate unless we with industrious perseverance prosecute the same to absolute perfection most agreeable therefore to this purpose be that which be excellent mention in the gospel it be not enough to put our hand to the plough if then we look back and leave the work unperfect wherefore let not the wise and discreet courtier too sudden set upon a work nor too soon set it away for many thing as the historian can tell we as they be not to be enterprise so neither be once attempt be they by their agent to be easy refuse because indeed the short space of remiss and unsettle inconstancy be able oftentimes to mar and utter to deface the grace credit and reputation of a man whole life hence then may thou see that industry and constancy constancy be marvelous useful yea that constancy and perseverance be a most noble virtue this teach we that thing necessary undertake be with invincible courage and a safe conscience to be finish and effect this be that virtue which arm and prepare we to bear and bear to the end cross loss and misfortune least fearful faint and yield to danger and distress we offend against the upright rule of reason final this virtue tell and teach we that he be not a man who heart be high mount and puff up with pride and selfeflation in prosperity or be strike dead and lowly deject to suffer for well-doing with adversity but that courtier be in a most happy case if he suffer either for the exact observation of the constitution and injunction of his prince former decease or for the constant confession or profession of his faith and religion this courtier may with joseph David and Daniel rejoice and be hearty glad in his own behalf that he do patient endure violence and offence for the defence of his inviolate and immaculate faith that for his pious opinion he suffer punishment and despiteful not to be ashamed to suffer for well do deal such a courtier I dare bold say may arrogate and assume unto himself that of Cicero sin and that there be nothing more commendable than for a man to be true content with the memory of his good deed and perfect liberty and to contemn and set at nought the thing of this life if that good fortune which be expect have fall out we shall be glad but if otherwise yet I rejoice although what I have be and what I may have be I can be if thou therefore show thyself such a man and be for the same despise and hate yet notwithstanding kick at and contemn even this contempt if so be that thou have set down this certain resolution to persist and persevere in do those thing which be honest just and true moreover let the courtier be careful lest while he endeavour to over come by pliantness and observance he slip into adulation and flattery who picture already we have indifferent paint forth if a courtier be degrade and displace from his height of honour and dignity do for all this live more content so that his wealth will bear it in enjoy a peaceable and private state and condition let he rather so continue then either afterward to accept of preferment inferior to the former or to adhere to the court of a more mean and less potent prince than the first unless by his wisdom authority judgement equity and such like virtue he be able to win unto he the love and affection of one more mighty let every wise courtier endeavour to be the feedesman of amity and unity between a prince his brother sister unanimity and such like not the bellows to blow the fire of brawl and dissension let he consider that peace be most precious let he I say again and again recogitate that they which be lover of discord and disquiet have seldom or never any good and expect issue or event of such their impious and nefarious plot and purpose he therefore whosoever which will sow the seed of sedition or dissension shall reap the crop of care and a vex and perplex mind let not the wise and intelligent courtier affect or effect sincerity any enormous or dishonest thing though with never so fair a colourable pretext or intention whereby he may steal into the favour and affection of his prince lest hereby he blemish yea utter blot out the noble fame and glory of his progenitor with the black coal of ignominy and with the maculation of most infamous aspersion for they err and err most gross which for hope of gain greedy desire of revenge of their honour by sly trick and treacherous deceit have a desire to exalt and advance their fortune but alas what be the issue of these in the end assure this that their treachery and villainy once finish and effect they receive the due and just reward of their treason and disloyalty which all ancient and modern history can easy confirm and ratify but it be undoubted to be suspect that no strong fortification precept or exhortation be with wicked and ungodly courtier of any such force as to force they from or to fortify they against this impious act or artificial impiety for wicked and ungodly courtier by pretend and counterfeit the contrary of what they intend do many time purchase to themselves great power and authority and by this mean very much increase and augment their own mean yea and by bribe all and such like course do wary make or the great part of the principal noble man and magistrate their great friend patron and protector and do creep or steal into place separate only for princess and great lady there to pry into the secret of prince wherein as in many other such like matter most fit to be wrap up in silence they use Sejanus as their best tutor and schoolmaster who horse they seem to have in keep a very proper praise I warrant you if thou devise or invent any craft or cozenage against a other o I wish it may light reside and abide upon thy own pate a courtier say he must have a body strong enable to under go labour and pain take a stout heart he must be a concealer of his own matter and a censorious and critic carper at other of a condition partake both of pride and flattery in outward show form and adorn with modest bashfulness but inward most libidinous covetous and greedy to have more and to this purpose to counterfeit sometime liberality yea to be prodigal or profuse in his expense and oftentimes to be industrious and vigilant which thing be not hurtful but very helpful to the sly and ambitious obtain of a kingdom but they which be instruct in these kind of art be once observe of their prince let they in due time be remove for they be indeed no better than the plague and pestilence of man infectious and pernicious to themselves and all other with who they have commerce and deal whensoever the honest courtier shall hear as oftentimes he may any thing utter against his prince there be no certain author or ground thereof let he by all mean endeavour to confute and repress such evil and calumnious report for many unhonest vain and profane fellow will not to permit his prince to be ill speak of scatter abroad false rumour and report of excellent prince that at one time or other the courtier may not want occasion to justify and maintain the estimation and reputation of his prince that by this mean he may purchase and procure to himself his prince favour and affection furthermore let the courtier very careful cover and to keep his own secret conceal from knowledge the exordium beginning and increase hope of his prince grace and favour towards he otherwise that which be likely to have be peculiar appropriate and appoint to himself alone will be convert or communicate to his emulator or corrival which be neither wise nor wary do wherefore taciturnity be i think in this case very behooveful taceturnitie profitable and necessary as be indeed the best safe and sure unite cord of the well manage of all our affair and to this purpose let he remember that of the witty poet. if Aesaps crow have feed in private place he well bid fare not share of hate disgrace let all both inveterate and late conceive rancour and to avoid all rancour and heart grudge hatred be far remote and remove from the courtier for it can otherwise be but that he which retain and maintain they within his bosom shall in the end be the special cause and procurer of his own ruin downfall and destruction and as it be not fit he shall nurse up any intestine or secret malice in his heart so must he be most vigilant and circumspect that he quench and utter extinguish it so soon as ere it be forge and suborn within he assure I easy see and foresee that that will come to pass if a man know and do not hate the manner and condition of courtier let he then which will eschew and avoid the malice of other man a little decline and give back in himself let the courtier also very careful observe this that when as he have happy and fortunate according to his heart desire obtain the grace and favour of his to observe his prince inclination prince he do not regardless neglect or abuse it in which respect it be most fit he shall most curious and thorough learn to know the nature condition and inclination of his prince so that as much as in he lie he may whole accommodate and apply himself to his custom and condition for as equality and parity of inclination do nourish and cherish amity and friendship so contrariwise disparity and unequality therein do dimolish friendship and in place thereof build up hatred and contempt let the courtier have a especial care and make principal observation of the law custom office condition to frame himself to the condition of the court he live in and disposition of that court wherein he live and undoubted it shall free and secure he if not from the malice of all yet at least from the most let he also consider and call to mind that if as now and than by the malice of time it be like enough to fall out he be constrain to put up to digest and bear patient any grievous and troublesome matter yet let he ever attribute and ascribe more to the love of justice than to the fear of malice and mischief for whosoever out of a fear of hatred fly justice shall be sure to be sensible of the punishment of injustice but seldom or never shall he taste the sweet fruit of equity in himself wherefore kind courtier let i advise thou that in a good and just cause thou be patient and harden thyself against adverse accident so shall thou be a victorious conquer and overcome for this be most certain true that he which can wear out the time of adversity and according to the mutability of various occurrent can as occasion serve contract abbreviate and prorogue or procrastinate delay in himself may undoubted reserve and fit himself for the expectation of a better time now since the vulgar sort of common people be ever not to rely on or trust unto the love of the common people variable unconstant and murable let the wise courtier never put any trust or confidence in they for assure the common people be a Hydra with many head or rather a strange creature without either head or sound understanding this be apparent know and antiquity of all pristine time do testify the same that many man have perish and make a tragical end who have join themselves unto and take part with the common people therefore he whosoever he be say most true and wise he which on common people voice depend hang worse than he that be hang upon a tree for that which quick come and go we see no dire effect or linger harm extend but that which do of doubtful part consist which move remove which strain constrain perplex which come and go which vanish and vex that that be a ill or I the mark have miss phocylides also have very exoellent paint out this beast with many head in the common people put no confidence for they be vain profane and variable to curb or keep they in thou be not able no more than fire or water violence let every not only courtier but judicious understanding man whatsoever think and assure persuade himself that this be a most slavish condition of life that a man shall seem to devise unto himself any proper or peculiar estate and fortune out of the disposition and behaviour of he to who he be in bondage and thraldom and he which observe and obey the covetous envious and ignorant common people who be altogether prone to mutability and inconstancy yea and which be the head and worst of all to those which be most ingrateful let he I say consider with himself whither it be likely that he can ever be happy or fortunate with such man or shall he not rather as often as he remember and call to mind his own estate and condition by nature so often lament and complain of his slippery fortune and calamity final let he know this also that he who he common serve be himself most miserable and in that respect let he have a great care that in the whole course of his courtly life be clear and free himself from his prince jealousy and sinister suspicion of he herein especial from the rumour and report of the vulgar sort and from that infectious pestilence of a court I mean enuy. will thou enlarge the limit of thy honour and authority than hate and contemn the common people affection who value nothing almost according to verity but many thing according to their own opinion unindifferencie mark this kind courtier I desire thou that thou may approve these thing whereof there be extant few or no document in the memory of any annal chronicle saying or ancient writing of the wise author by this mean I say thou shall easy gain credit and authority and maintain and keep it be once get moreover let courtier take heed that they lose not the beginning or first entrance into favour and affection by be with their prince at unseasonable hour that be if they let slip and do not always watch most careful a mature most fit and convenient time but this we have already at large discuss but this one thing which we have not hitherto admonish to be advise what employment he undertake may not by any mean be here pretermit namely that the courtier not be heedful but very heedless be oftentimes the cause of his own downfall and subversion to wit when he affect and make choice of such a kind of service and employment as be hateful and distasteful to his prince again let the courtier as far as he be able most accurate tread in the direct footstep of his prince and to observe his prince in all thing be very great wisdom observe most diligent what he allow what he disallow if the courtier expect any benefit or commodity as the fruit of his labour let he be assure that not the least part thereof be to be expect and seek for out of this foresay treasury or storehouse as I may so term it let he also be hereof assure that there be no better by his action to express his love to his prince mean to purchase his prince grace and affection than that he by due action express unto his prince that he be more near and dear unto he than his own life and that he will be content to suffer death itself for his prince life and safety whatsoever courtier be of this mind though peradventure he may have a just occasion for some private respect to complain of his prince yet shall he by this mean easy avoid and put away froward and perverse speech which otherwise he may to cover and conceal discontent break forth into and shall due consider that his superior be of he always reverent to be regard true he spit against himself which spit against heaven he be scarce wise who notwithstanding that the power and authority of his king or prince be extend over he yet will not obey he but the great power of a prince be apparent in this that with his word only he can take punishment as well on he that be absent as present as well of a fugitive traitor as of any other malefector according to that a long as each subject understand that king have long hand he therefore shall enjoy much peace and tranquillity which be submissive obedient to his king or prince who thus as we have hear be able even by his word only to manifest his majesty power and authority when as on the other side wicked malefactor and ungodly transgressor do not a little provoke and procure to themselves the sharpness of his majestical edict or commandment let the courtier therefore study with all diligence and to get acquaintance with the best in the Court care to know the inclination and disposition of his prince and to be well know himself of those which customary be near about he and so shall he undoubted acquire the end of his honest and just desire he than which be thus resolve must especial depend upon himself and his virtue and as former be say must reverent respect his prince special favourite and attendant but must not by any mean undiscreet discover or impart his action and intention to any let the courtier therefore shun and avoid undiscreet futillitie and blabe loquacity nor must he unlock the closet of his heart and so discover his secret no not unto those who he esteem his most intimate friend and familiar unless in case of necessity for let he be assure that the reward of secrecy be safety which also we have already large dilate now therefore as the courtier must keep to himself to be secret both to himself and other his own secret so also must he not like a barrel full of reave and cleft leak out on every side or like a prattle jay tell abroad the secret of other man commit to his fidelity for such as these be deserve term curious and audacious babbler and if we believe Plutarch this idle spawn and brood of sycophant be breed from the family and tribe of idle and curious questionist man for the most part of ignoble and degenerous condition and such as love to broach abroad into open view the misery and misfortune of other man but do thou kind courtier refrain and abstain from this so perverse a molestation and mere pedantical a vice and be never unmindful of that notable distich touch that once great courtier look to thyself and thy own office (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) thou own charge to discharge learn by my fall hate like a plague to be pragmatical if at any time we fee a man exalt and erect by his not to hate he who the king will honour prince to great possession and honourable revenue let we also attribute unto he due honour reverence and respect and let we not set he at nought as a upstart and unworthy man or as if he be neither renown or noble by birth nor adorn with learning or any excellent part if thou hate and dishonour such a man who thy king will honour and dignify beware that thereby thou incur not the hatred of thy prince himself but peradventure thou will tell i he be a man much unworthy the same and his end will prove it true put case he be so and I deny not but sometime it may be so yet all this not withstand I wish thou with that author of most exquisite and profound judgement I mean Tacitus to use these and suchlike speech great prince although thou have elect and choose before other man much more worthy than he a man scarce know unto we and unworthy thy princely grace and bounty yet I envy not his felicity nor hate he for his dignity but as a fellow counsellor and as execute thy great affair in the common wealth I honour and reverence he hereby good courtier who be thou be thou may consider that it be not fit thou shall exasperate the indignation of thy prince against thou though he be please to magnify or extol this or that man though unworthy or unlearned and respectles neglect and pass by thou peradventure a more worthy person think with thyself that this be a rule observe even by heathen yea practise it be lawful for ever man to do what he will with his own among private and mean man that he which use his own prerogative power and authority do injury to no man now if in this regard it be permit to any private man to enjoy his own liberty how much more ought it to be yield unto that a prince may confer his favour upon this or that man in such or such opinion and judgement unworthy the same and to pass over if he please other noble man esteem and repute more worthy than the other yet not withstand I be of opinion that the excellent or grave counsellor be not to be blame but do very wise and advise which solicit and incite his prince to promote and prefer good and honest man man that be lover of learning and virtue and profitable exercise about the benefit and good of their country and common wealth undoubted a good and godly prince can but high approve and allow of without suspect of error or impudence the honest exhortation of so wise a councillor a prince may do well to think upon that of Antiochus a good observation to prince who twice be the leader and commander of a army against the persian who as in a hunt he be chase a dear and happen into a homely cottage of a poor countryman do there learn reg^s and that king and prince do seldom hear the truth therefore a wise king shall not less estimate and value his courtier which be prudent pious and lover of truth than those which only practice and accustom themselves to tickle his ear with smooth and soothe speech not withstand we must know this for a truth that although true honest and religious man know not how to lie yet live in the court they be force sometime against their will even in the bosom simulation and dissimulation of the court to utter many evil yea false and feign opinion and rule much savour of simulation yea prince themselves witness Tiberius do love and allow of dissimulation which oftentimes for one cause or other can almost by any mean be want in a Court what say you to David who be both a king and a prophet yet he also make use of dissimulation neither be that of the emperor Sigismond unknown who be wont to say he that know not how to dissemble know not how to rule and govern all this notwithstanding if thou be wise take the counsel of the philosopher neither counterfeit or dissemble nor simulate or speak untrue let not the ill custom of more evil man seduce or induce thou to be as evil or worse than themselves and that thou may not be entangle in this snare nor shackle to hate filthy lucre. in these gyve reject and despise foul and filthy lucre and let not the accurse hunger of gold and gain at any time too much please thy palate or delight thy appetite for he which be and will be of this mind shall never be able to keep his conscience unclogged his tongue clean from untruth his hand pure from bribe or his heart undefiled with filthy and impious imagination again let the courtier learn to be his money master and commander not his money minister to be command by it yea let he learn of the comical poet that sometime the forbearance of money be especial great gain let he also incessant observe this rule and direction so long as he reside and remain in the court that as much as in he lie and so far forth as he may with a safe conscience keep his honour and reputation unspotted and untainted that he I say so far forth as time serve and occasion administer various and to observe the time and place diverse condition and alteration do judicious and circumspect make use hereof if his prince and the affair at court be cheerful and merry let he also be merry and joyful but if they be sad and sorrowful let he in like manner be the same it be not almost to be express and utter in word what prosperous and fortunate success many courtier have obtain by this one especial observation but above all thing let he be most mindful and careful herein that whensoever he be to dispatch any weighty or important affair in foreign nation he accommodate himself to the custom and manner of the same place so long as he there remain I can compendious comprise or epitomize the large discourse and dilatation which this part of prudence this excellent decorum and most graceful behaviour may just exact and require of i excellent therefore say he Romano more when thou be at Rome put on a roman face live as they live wheresoe'er thou come in place but here kind courtier thou must understand that this admonion concern especial the law and institution of those kingdom and country wherein we most proper live o how ingenuous be that man which understand this aright o how prudent be he which be due circumspect therein moreover the free bear courtier that be he which either by his own power and industry or by some especial how to carry himself in his prosperity and singular grace and favour of his prince have float aloft and ascend unto some indifferent height of honour let he not bear himself too hauty and towards his superior too arrogant with his inferior nor too malapert and uncourteous among his equal I have already incite and invite thou to humility and modesty therefore I omit to insist far thereon one only word by the way let i add thereunto namely that if humility be link and knit together with authority it make it exceed acceptable yea and to be have in wonderful admiration ascend humily be it be far better and much more credit as that most prudent king Solamon admonish that it be say to thou come up hither than to be deject and set low in the presence of thy prince final take and make use of that of the wise philosopher whereof he very excellent advise thou let no man be presumptuous in prosperity nor desperate in adversity for various be the vicissitude of all thing let this than I say make the courtier circumspect to provide for his own welfare in due time wise that if at any time it so fall out that he perceive his prince favour to be turn into frown and that the envy of his enemy begin to take growth against he let he then with all convenient maturity desire a honest dismission to depart from the court and of himself to lay aside his courtly dignity rather than to expect when he shall be by other envious eject the rule be this it be far better to prevent than to be prevent which whensoever occasion be offer to provide for thy honour and reputation I wish thou to make good use of but since there be nothing in the court of prince more perilous or pernicious to noble peer and great statesman than be backbiter and slanderer and the assistant and suggester unto slander be ignorance jealousy hatred trap and treachery therefore it be not amiss even for the prince himself in this respect to be very advise careful and circumspect that such worthy man and wise counselor man I say of most worthy merit and desert of their prince and common wealth may not by such base and ignominious man of who we have former make mention be so injurious defame abvy and even butcher a prince therefore shall by all mean endeavour lest by liftn to back biter the person accuse be utter prohibit to make answer for himself he be not inquisitive about the controversy nor give sentence against he until he have first judicious and impartial hear the other party also speak for himself now a ambitious courtier be he who under pretence a ambitious courtier of amplify and enlarge the royalty and dignity of his prince in all his action follow the line of his own lust displace his ancient honest and approve colligue or fellow officer substitute and suborn other who he please in their place if any thing be by the prince mention or proffer of marriage to the courtier as touch matrimony he shall do very unwise if he refuse to be direct therein by he but let he rather so far incline himself that he make no contract or agreement without the good like consent and pleasure of his prince what good and how great profit may hence arise unto he no wise man but may well perceive and understand let the couriter also contemn and scorn those honour not to use indirect course to rise to honour which he can attain unto without the perpetrate of gross impiety for as nothing violent be permanent so questionless whatsoever be get by wiliness and wickedness can never be fortunate or durable observe good courtier what be preposterous repugnant to reason what be wicked what unjust and hate the same and whither in time of peace or war thou enterprise any thing accommodate thy wit thy will thy power and policy to the full performance and diligent dispatch thereof and since the affair of great man be very unstable anxious and variable trust therefore rather to thy own power and virtue than to any other let not that move or molest thou which no wise man wonder at that in the court sometime illiterate idiot prove great man true it oftentimes come to pass that such as these do for a season enjoy the favour and friendship of their prince and do fond persuade themselves that they may free without controlment or correction say or do any thing what ere they please but alas they quick come down and so do all those that be not rule by virtue and reason but by their own vile and vicious affection administer to themselves occasion of their own destruction and run headlong into the pit they have prepare for other consider these thing kind courtier I advise thou and when thou see such a one place and grace above thou though thou do not approve it yet do not resist but bear it content and in the interim be vigilant and provident that base fellow make thou not as bad as themselves be always in all thing very cautelous and circumspect a caution for rich courtier when thou be to deal with thy prince but especial if thou be wealthy and rich lest afterward thou be force to say and to say too true my village good and good fortune wherein I once inebriate myself have now undo i this assure happen to many man especial to courtier covetous and desirous of domination over other which make they estimate and value honour shame truth body soul and all but base and beggarly to a kingdom but these I say be most worthy to be detest and hate of prince and even to be thrust out by the head and shoulder and utter banish the court. furthermore let the courtier so modest wise and advise behave himself that as near as may be he be able to approve and justify his action and employment to his prince nor let he undertake any thing appertain to the court wherein he live his prince not be acquaint there with so shall he repel and beat back the deadly dart of envy which otherwise upon light and slight occasion may be either from his prince or other level and shoot at he let the courtier also take heed that he wrong not such to take heed who we provoke to anger and indignation a man who brother or kindred may just be fear will be furious and fatal revenger thereof he that be injure write his wrong in marble not in dust resist not therefore but bear with patience that which can by any mean be alter be persuade that he which yield to time serve and obey honesty and that they do excellent bear their misfortune which wise cover and conceal they magnify not thyself against those which can suppress and pull thou down and strive not to stand upright there where thou be constrain to fall down flat this one thing remain that thou hurt no man but if thou thyself be hurt or molest with petty injury it be far better content to endure they than with any the least danger to indeavoure to repel they again let the honest and religious courtier who be of equality in power and authority endeavour by all mean to establish unity and concord and let he utter reject and cast a way all jar grudge and seed of dissension which be indeed more pernicious than the tooth of a fierce dog or the sting of a poisonous serpent let he also which attempt or enterprise any thing discreet and prudent recogitate yea and premeditate the same that so his employment a mean be ever observe may gain and obtain a happy and hope issue or conclusion for we shall seldom see a prosperous event of those thing which be in considerate and precipitate attempt wherefore let he again and again cast in mind with what council with what conclusion any thing be to be do be to be leave undo see that courtier set council at sail and sell their prince prince secret it be very material that he will take aspeciall care that nothing at court may be vendible and that thereby he open not a gap to ambition and corruption more over let the courtier be very careful that he swell not in heart nor over high lift up his head because peradventure he have abundant receive much honour and dignity from the hand of his benign and note this bountiful prince for it may so come to pass that all those dignity and preferment which through the whole course of thy life thou have acquire thou may in a moment of time through thy ill usage and abuse soon lose they and be utter bereave of they and what then thou shall be thereby the only occasioner of thy own unrecoverable detriment and damage and give thy enemy if thou have any as that be not to be doubt a just cause to laugh thou to scorn the controuler of a court and tutor of young prince must convive and wink at some matter in that their minority and tender age especial if no man be damnify or hurt thereby that in matter of high import and great consequence they may the better rule and rectify they furthermore because the necessity of a man country to train up and bring up horse the greatness of renown and abundance of riches do all require that a courtier shall be very forward incline to bring up horse and by how much the more noble and generous mind a man be so much the more willing do he spare no cost upon a beast of a stout stomach tractable to be train up to war and fit for the defence of his person therefore I say the courtier shall not be pinch and spare but most forward and ready in the buy and bring up of such a beast especial if he perceive his prince to be delight with the view and exercise of the most generous stout and stately horse what need many word he must not only train up horse but himself oftentimes back they and exercise his body to ride for assure that of Crisaneas in xenophons four be very remarkable and worthy observation who so high commend the cunning and skilfullnesse of ride of horse that he think assure he can fly like a bird have be be a of the excellency of ride horse good horse man and certain this horse-riding be a warlike exercise and most befiting a prince or noble peer to this purpose also we read in Plutarch that julius Caesar be so exquisite and skilful a rider even from his childhood that turn both his hand behind he to his back he will oftentimes use to put his horse to the most furious and swift career that possible may be if again thy prince take especial delight in hunt the praise of hunt do thou also kind courtier high allow of the same and let neither labour cold no nor the love of thy wife at home withhold thou from it hear what Cicero say to this purpose say he be the power of custom or exercise it enure hunter to watch all night in the snow and to scorch and burn themselves by day in the sun on the high mountain and no marvel for hunt be a exercise as pleasant as profitable and commendable the spartan in time past use to instruct their youth therein and it be a ancient custom and practice among the roman to exercise their young man not only to handle their weapon to ride horse and such like but even to hunt and run of race to exercise the agility and the nimbleness of their body for this laborious kind of exercise put vigour into the tender mind of young man it corroborate their strength accustome they to courage and fortitude increase the power and faculty both of the body and mind yea and it especial cause nimbleness and patience to endure many brunt and difficult exigent this be the exercise which very much preserve the health of the body and among noble and renown prince beget much honour and reputation and this do that most acute and ingenuous poet in his epistle plain ratify among the roman hunt be a game for pleasure health and mirth of noble fame since therefore not only in ancient time but even in these our day most potent and magnificent king and prince have even from their childhood most desirous and with wonderful commendation use and delight in this noble exercise those courtier do not miss the mark which endeavour to imitate their prince in so famous and worthy a recreation and with all diligence use it and take especial delight in it neither may I wrong this so excellent a exercise as with silence to pass over the notable effect thereof namely that the prince or any other honourable courtier have his mind and thought busy nay even overwhelm with the various wave of care and distract encumbrance may even in the midst of these overflow flood of trouble and molestation relaxate and recreate himself with hunt for who be so stoic or stone-like as that in the very pursuit and chase of the deer yea and in the strike and pierce thereof may not with great boldness and alacrity with the liricke poet say qua^ cur as what be be who love or labours-care so fright as once to mind they in so much delight nay to who I pray you be it not a remedy against all his grind and devour trouble if with Ascanius amid the pleasant shadey vale and dale he be well mount on a stately steed outrun the best which in the race prevail or with his blade make foam boar to bleed or from the mountain meet a lion strong who with his sword he vow to lay along this then be the sum of all we have say hereof namely that the ancient roman have hunt in especial use and exercise as a certain (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) or introduction unto martial prowess touch which matter he that desire to know more let he read Cicero lib. 2. towards the latter end thereof there shall the courtier find such thing as be not by any mean to be condemn or contemn by any wise or discreet courtier especial when he shall perceive that his prince be so high delight with so noble and majestical a pastime which as be aforesaid do wonderful augment and increase the strength and manly vigour of the body and mind wherefore Sallust be not worth the listen unto in this regard who though otherwise a most renown flourish and politic author and relator of the affair of Rome yet seem to liken hunt to country husbandry and other servile exercise concern travail into other kingdom or nation of travel into fotraine nation I say thus much that it be very useful and necessary for a courtier for the time to come the reason be both weighty and just for first by this mean he understand the custom and condition of other nation by experimental knowledge and much use he grow more cautelous and circumspect over himself he thereby also be instruct in the knowledge of tongue and shall behold as it be the mirror or look glass of all mortal man and both discern and learn many most important and profitable matter out of the strange variety of nation and their manner and condition I doubt not but there be many of a clean contrary opinion who certain in my opinion be not in this case to be credit for if we do compare one thing with another what excellent knowledge and experience shall he possess both of affair custom and tongue beyond he which never see any other than such as himself nor ever look far than his father cottage or into his own parish church travail therefore can questionless but be very profitable and necessary for a courtier yea for any generous or ingenuous educate gentleman whatsoever especial if it be order and undertake not only for private pleasure and delight but for a public profit and utility the prudent courtier to who this wholesome counsel may be effectual and who can be with Ulysses (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) a Proteus to temporize or frame himself to all time manner and condition may contemplate search out and learn the condition or manner of man and the situation of many town and city that be he may perfect understand and true know how to travail with fruitful commodity now than that courtier which be fraught and furnish with such experience I think can easy disrobe himself of that due true and ancient observance who grace and excellent comeliness ever take place least by negligent remissness a way be open and make ready to other even upstart to ascend the step to dignity and honour before he out of this warehouse or rather sweet stream spring the courtier may both exhaust and learn to thwart and cross the counsel of his crafty enemy and to retort the dart and arrow which be direct against he into the face of their envious archer this caution be in this place very pertinent and useful because that notwithstanding thou may perceive and see into the craft and subtlety of thy adversary in court yet it be not convenient always to disclose or discover they but far better wise to dissemble cover and conceal they unto some fit time which occasion may happy administer unto thou now also kind courtier touch wanton wander of lascivious or wanton love and unlawful love receive some admonition but as brief as may be avoid it I say kind courtier by all mean avoid it will thou know the reason one be not sufficient i will give thou more first thy fame be thereby confound thy riches or substance be thereby as with a sponge suck up and draw dry thy reputation name and shame be leave to the pleasure fancy and will of a woman and the vigour virtue and worthiness of wit be utter lose pretty say Plautus to this purpose animus be where I be I be not where I be not yet there my mind remain when the lover mind be on the thing belove hear I pray thou good courtier and believe this one thing he be no vain idle or addle head fellow neither do he sing a mere fiction or feign tale who ere he be that leave these verse in writing nun put as as who fiction sere it be that love a lad o what strange hand I pray do think he have for first he see how lover senseless live and how slight grief he from much good do drive this be certain most true and therefore if thou desire a salve for this sore and to see or to seek a end of lewd love take and make use of this counsel fly idleness and Cupid have no might use exercise and he will be put to flight avoid idleness therefore which thou may easy do since action of honest and laudable employment can to hate idleness never be want in a court if any man misdeem or censure the worst of thou let it be thy care to depel and put from thou his sinister suspicion and to convince the care and fear wherein thou be the most artificial mean hereof be use all affability in speech flicker enticement and present honourable gift for he which will overcome his enemy with least detriment or danger and most assurance of safety must with many benefit fair promise and such like artillery assault and vanquish he neither be this counsel causeless for under correction be it speak all courtier be either by nature so form or by education so addict that they hold it a special point of wisdom or policy at least to cover and colour their hatred with false feign and fair concealment and thereby do oftentimes put forth and proffer their hand to those who in their heart they hate and give they the most smooth and glaver term they can devise with out any true or sincere intention I may easy confirm what I here affirm by a most probable and observable example that triple head Cerberus of inhuman tyranny Caligula Claudius and Nero have destroy many famous and most virtuous man who cruelty and butchery a certain ancient mark this and grave courtier have wise and very subtle avoid and escape and it be demand by what mean he among so many escape such and so many inevitable danger and trap of their tyranny his answer be by often endure injury and by show himself most thankful though he have small cause for the same let the courtier by all mean follow his footstep and though he live not in the court of any tyrannical king yet though he reside and abide in the court of a most courteous and just prince let he either so fit and prepare himself as that he may be always ready to swallow down and digest many yea any molestation and discontent or else let he without delay depart from the court as most unfit to live therein the reason questionless why many courtier do make no progress in their proceed have no other original than because their hope be dubious and diverse distract and unsettle in that they cleave not firm to some patron or protector of they and their fortune but be thou kind note this courtier prudent and abstinent as also most confident that virtue be most valiant and invincible be unite to a strong adherent and doubtless it be far better to combine and conjoin himself with some primate or chief peer as his patron and to follow he then to be a follower of many and yet firm affect of none certain as he be no where which be every where so questionless he that serve and seek after many shall not sound or sincere find any for that which be diverse and separate can choose but be feeble and very desperate let the courtier never be obvious or opposite to the pleasure of his prince so they be honest and warrantable for otherwise he may quick fall from the favour and affection not to be opposite to his prince of his prince and in vain do a man strive against the stream and certain a man must sometime yield and submit to time place and the person of friend yea he that live with his superior have not need to contend and strive but to wink and connive at many matter and rather sometime to lose his own right than with lose labour or rather eminent danger to contest or contend with his prince or superior and yet as I have former say this be to be consider with this proviso that it be so far forth as he may with a safe conscience excuse himselfee and the renown of his prince furthermore some other impious and ignominious courtier have a trick to try their fortune and to slanderous accusation hunt after the favour and affection of their prince by be most inquisitive to search and find out those with who they understand the prince be offend that they may most malicious and pernicious accuse they to their prince with unjust accusation infamous lie and slanderous imputation example hereof be extant both ancient and modern in Germany France Spain and else where but that which be most conspicuous and sensible to Seneca be most memorable if in the court the prince have 2. 3. or more in suspense for such and such matter of ill demeanour let such then as will show themselves wise intermit and leave off frequent conference and much private talk or whisper among themselves which if they do not they may chance to add fuel to the fire or put flax into the flame and far better it be to cease and assuage then to foster and increase the jealousy and suspicion of the prince for since as have former be touch the suspicious man be most common deceive why may not a prince also err and be deceive in his suspicious imagination which his error I can wish that thou kind courtier will be the cause to discover unless by thy wisdom and upright deal thou can open and bold annshilate the impulsive or primary cause thereof let the courtier addict himself unto and deck himself to be of civil and courteous behaviour with urbanity and most civil demeanour and be furnish with merry pleasant and witty conceit in his conference or talk but let he by all mean avoid both in jest and in earnest all quippical taunt and satirical bite term for he which endeavour and desire to purchase and procure the benevolent respect of other by rudeness rusticity and barbarity of speech do rather discover his own simplicity than any smooth or facile humanity but that which be neat and trim contrive be indeed the fruit of a witty invention do most delight and recreate the hearer and be more sound and soon approve of by thy judgement of the most indifferent wherefore let thy merry jest and witty speech be graceful and honest not bitter or bite scoff of jest and merry speech not deliver the bare truth of thing which indeed be a occasion to bite to the quick the party touch therein let the courtier also put far from he all clownishness which in jest and merriment show but a dull wit and slowness yea be very unsavoury and mere foolishness let he no less set pack all scurrility or saucy and malapert derision which mirth be very shameful and unseemly final let he hate as a capital enemy uncivil snapishnesse which also in merriment be no better than dog snarl and virulent or envious bite the fault and offence of imprison m incarcerate of courtier commit to hold courtier be not to be extenuate by any other in the court but be to be bury at least in the depth of silence and not mention at all by they neither yet must they privy whisper or avouch open that such man be blameless and innocent who for envy hatred and displeasure they apparent perceive to be imprison for certain if it be our human condition to err and to be apt to slip by natural infirmity even the prince himself be violent carry away with a certain precipitate heedlessness and heat of spirit may in some one case or other commit a error yet notwithstanding he be not bind to give a account thereof to any private or particular courtier whatsoever let not the courtier therefore rash and inconsiderate miscensure or disallow what his prince may be please to like of and allow let he not excuse or account such a man as guiltless who his prince do accuse and condemn as guilty of some notorious or public offence prince have their secret which who so ere dare or desire to peep or pry into shall hardly be free from danger and give most palpable and apparent sign of his gross imprudence in this case therefore let the courtier be very cautelous and circumspect that he dive not too deep into this dangerous gulf but that he keep near the shore and that he wise conceal much more than he shall dare to reveal and that he depress and keep in what he shall not express yea let this be the period of all that silence be a safe and sure reward to he which embrace the same though peradventure the courtier may perceive that a wise caution he be vilipend and not much respect or regard of his prince yet let he very advise take heed that he express not the least semblance or appearance of indignation or discontent against he but let he every where carry himself with all sign of obsequious observance he may free think whatsoever he please for as our english proverb say think be free but let he take heed that he speak not open what he have in his heart conceive privy in matter also of piety and religion the courtier not to trouble himself about matter of religion shall do exceed wise if he superficial meddle not with too nice inquisition after unprofitable and unnecessary thing as about the innovation or alteration of phrase in the sacred scripture yea and let he endeavour to prevent all such like action that he may show he approve not the leiutie and inconstancy of such vain and fleet fellow by answer and subscribe to their condition and thereby show himself a companion and copartner in their unbeseeming curiosity I will not good courtier that thou shall be too strict bind with this indissoluble bond of religion from which thou may easy untie and unlose thyself without the prop and protection of other thy teacher and instructor and that this admonition be not frivolous or fruitless the unhappy time of our forefather yea and this present and most turbulent time in the low-countries do most true testify if any discord and dissension happen in the court let the courtly chaplain be very sedulous to appease and of chaplain in the court. qualify the same to reconcile they as brother to admonish they as man to reprehend and reduce they as wanderer and go astray and with the savoury and wholesome sweetness of courtesy and gentleness to dissolve and bring to nought the argument of the opponent they must be peacemaker not to increase wrath but to make peace and appease wrath not to foster faction among the contentious but to lull it asleep yea into a dead sleep that it may not be easy awake again final not to plant the young sprig or to sow the seed of litigious discord and grudge between they but with the sickle and sword of God word to supplant and eradicate the same certain such a ecclesiastical courtier will hereby apparent approve indeed that he be the disciple of that great doctor that he follow the footstep and tread the path of that fruitful pastor which once say peace not discord be unto you wherefore as that prince of the celestial palace do especial love peace and live in peace let we also in this vale and dale of tear in this mansion of misery and mortality do the same and be the same in the occupation and possession of kingdom and province it be no small advantage for a soldier to make use of a well speak prelate or preacher of the court for if he be one that be excellent rhetorical and subtle of speech and argue he shall assure do much a politic note more good thereby than a soldier by his weapon in war the action of those most factious jesuite in the siege at Paris and obtain and take in of the kingdom of Bohemia by George ratify and confirm the truth hereof who for all his fair and smooth tale have never attain or enjoy the end of his desire if he have not use the veil and vizard of religion and make Roikiranus the priest his spokesman in the business frequent example also may we find in other kingdom and nation which here I willing let pass but this counsel although indeed it may peradventure take effect yet for all that if any shall demand of i whither such a project be to be practise or praise worthy my answer shall be that such counsel be not always to be administer to a prince by a pious religious and honest courtier this question also have be urge by some prudent be and nature courtier namely whither a courtier furnish with excellent natural part be to be prefer before he which be adorn with art and science without the former true to speak with Hypocrates that be best which be establish and perfect by nature nature always work more perfect and as another say by a certain inbreed and secret law be able to take revenge these thing sure we must needs say and hold for truth and yet we do not utter repudiate that axiom as a thing of no import or consequence art be a more sure and certain guide the courtier which have spend the flourish spring time and summer of his age in the court and which also of give over to follow the court. by the gracious aspect and respect of his prince have achieve much honour wealth and dignity must not for light and slight occasion relinquish the court but if so be that the time prove dangerous if his travail and pain be overgreat and grievous final if sickness or such like do just move and admonish he to another kind of life let he honest and discreet desire a dismission from the court rather than to change the continue course of his life with a too sudden or scarce honest and seasonable alteration let the wise courtier industrious and diligent consider of enter into familiarity in mind who and what a one he be who he entertain in to intimate society and familiarity yea into his administration and service touch thy friend kind courtier this be my advice that thou be not overhasty of friend in make choice of he and who thou have choose do not rash put from thou now herein there be need of sound judgement and curious choice for if we will credit the comedian there be but a few friend among many that be true faithful to their friend final let that friend be near and dear unto thou who virtue and parity of honest quality and condition have conglutinate and knit unto thou now also concern thy servant thou must sedulous of servant or attendant take heed and serious think upon that proverb as true as ancient host look how many servant we have so many enemy we have let no man therefore too far trust his servant nor be so conceit that he can hearty love thou which serve thou more for fear then affection and what man be he which be ignorant and know not that there be and have be many man who instead of a faithful friend and servant have find a faithless and mercenary hire witness against they yea a traitor unto they wherefore the wise courtier have need to bestow no little care and pain take herein but let he especial to take heed offeruant in matter of secrecy take heed that if at a feast or banquet or else where he intend to speak somewhat more free then ordinary of any matter whatsoever let he as near as possible may be exclude his servant from the hear thereof for how many discommodity and inconvenience those courtier have incur which have herein be remiss and careless be I be sure so sure and certain know as that there need not any proof thereof by superfluous or needless relation those courtier by how much the more potent and powerful they be in regard of their prince favour and affection towards they be for the most part so much the more hate and contemn of other unless they have fortify that favour and affection with singular kindness and affability in themselves certain if any remedy may be find against this malady or if their be any liquidity or moisture which can extinguish or at least diminish this furious flame of envy it be the sweet juice of gentleness and courtesy memorable and remarkable be that which Alphonsus that most renown king of Arragon mark this good couruer be wont to say thou must cast a piece of bread to a snarl dog insinuate and signify that wrathful outrageous and envious people must be please and appease by smooth humanity and that they can by any mean be pacify with bitterness and rough deal kind courtier I desire thou therefore to observe and to follow the tract and trace of that mostnoble King prince new establish have for the most part litigrous servant and contentious officer and common they use to contend and separate themselves into diverse faction for chief place and priority in their contention in this regard I advise and counsel the courtier that he take heed of those who for their own advantage and profit like Aesop base and turn coat bat do lean sometime to this faction sometime to that but concern neutrality we have already deliver our opinion although the prince may in his own peculiar love how to continue and increase a prince favour begin and affection have make choice of the courtier yet let he all this notwithstanding endeavour to procure unto himself a honest and faithful propitious patron who may still kindle and increase the fire of his prince affection to his far felicity favour and welfare now in the interim let the courtier little or nothing regard how he be estimate or account of by other especial the vulgar sort so that his prince by who he may be promove and advance to dignity and honour do approve and due praise his fidelity painfulness and industry excellent and very considerable be that which be record of Steven king of Polonia of who it be report that he shall say to Castelanus at that time his high chancellor stand by he according to the fashion and custom of his ancestor I will make thou short sit down by i esteem as nothing therefore kind courtier other that will seem to pull thou down so long as thy prince intend to promote and prefer thou fear not I say if maugre all the malice of any other thy prince be please to set thou down by he who late do but stand attend on he concern vesture and apparel I advise thou kind of apparel courtier let it not be thy least care for it may easy be that either by excess or defect therein may be engender and occasion either thy praise or dispraise observe this also that thou follow such a habit apparel consultation and action as may bring credit and commendation to thou and breed envy in thy emulator this also be the true nature and property of court-lyer a forget of lie in the court. that when they once begin first a fly and unfaithful rumour be spread abroad which by fly far like a snowball roll in the snow grow big and big than some other not of the mean but high rank and order affirm and avouch it which thereupon be divulge promulgate and make common in the mouth of all man and by this mean do blab and lie courtier begulle and delude the credulous common people this undoubted be evident enough and more than sufficient apparent to all which we may by most express and faithful example more lively illustrate but that example of this kind be always most odious wherefore I will now go forward and here I also advise what one a courtier shall be the courtier that it be not sufficient that he be void of all vice and free from foul enormity and gross deformity unless he be adorn and beautify with those virtue whereby dignity grace and authority may be purchase let he not therefore be careless of his same and good name not covetous of other man good but honest spare and thrifty of what be his own and a provident keeper and maintainer of the common good the courtier be advance and extol to some of his carriage in turbulent affair his prince be absent great and egregious height of honour and dignity and in the absence of his prince be as it be precedent or principal agent in a intricate employment and affair of great consequence be also desirous to frustrate the expectation of the common people since he be not in himself able to bridle curb and keep they under when they unjust importune the death captivity or imprisonment of any one let he wise dissemble his anger and displeasure and let he affirm and protest that he will do more good for they than they desire and thereby shall he in the interim set the innocent party at liberty from undeserved danger and calamity this kind of art or subtlety whensoever opportunity administer occasion thereunto be very high to be commend in a court. now the pious prudent and intelligent courtier shall of disputation in matter of religion do exceed well to and move his prince that he will not frequent permit public disputation or altercation in matter of religion the case be plain a measure be praiseworthy but true faith ost move remove doubtful disturbance have do not those example which we have in that famous empire of Germany in France and some of the province of the low country at this day ratify and confirm this truth how many ocean of evil and troian-misery have flow from this fountain alas forsooth every illiterate waterman and paltry porter must now adays prove a disputant must be show forth the superficies and outside of his wit and wiliness and must first teach before he himself have ere learned or be teach and all these notwithstanding shame and sorrow it be to speak it they themselves do utter neglect to live pious sober and upright gain they not a goodly commendation get they not I pray a huge harvest and a copious crop of piety and religion thereby o light leave void of fruit o smoky shaddew without any true substance wherefore let the courtier be such a lover of piety and true religion that he may be a special mean to his prince that refractory and obstinate irregular man may by his authority be force and constrain to live in order and true obedience let the honest courtier be ever of this honest mind and never let he desire or endeavour to fish with the froward in the water of wilful obstinacy contention or dissension and indeed what other effect do difference in religion bring forth but that even subject also be at variance and utter defiance one with another let the courtier I say understand and know this let he free and faithful put his prince in mind of this namely that this anchor can so easy be move but that the whole ship of the commonwealth must needs be remove and assure I be persuade that hatred for the most part do inhabit the heart of the common people through dissension and difference in religion towards those who they hold and esteem either perverse or adverse therein nor be they afraid to do harm and injury to those who they imagine and suppose hereby to hurt even God himself now whensoever the courtier confer with his prince concern these and such like matter of great moment let he endeavour to use a reverend respective and moderate kind of speech and not uncomely or unseemly alter his countenance for doubtless such a kind of gesture and demeanour can but be very acceptable delightful and forcible in a prudent prince yea and thereby thou shall as it be even set before he a mirror or look glass wherein to contemplate and behold thy modest mind and sweet conversation it be almost unutterable how much it concern every affability and courteous behaviour in a courtier most excellent courtier to be both by natural disposition and artificial acquisition fashion and make sit in the allure and delight man with his external carriage and behaviour whosoever therefore be by the goodness of nature or art best garnish and furnish herewith and can with speedy expedition bring his affair to a perfect end and final conclusion such a courtier whensoever occasion be offer wherein he may without all thrasonical brag manifest and declare the efficacy and power of his wit and learning ought ever most circumspect and considerate to make use of the same as for example if he be to undertake a business of great import and consequence with his prince let he very attentive listen thereunto not be defatigate or tire with any other affair lest that which shall be seasonable and mature become hereby unseasonable and immature that which thou will have acceptable prove unacceptable and lest thou find that which shall be profitable and commodious unprofitable and obnoxious unto thou let he therefore if he be wise as be form early advise diligent observe a fit time and opportunity lest he both suffer his talk to be unperfect and his patience and hope prove vain and be fond frustrate for this be ever as sure as sure may be in the court camp and whole condition of a man life that hope and reward be ever most anxious and uncertain which as much as may be it be very fit and convenient to correct and rectify by a kind of art and perspicuity of wit and understanding what herein I have affirm be true confirm by one who so ever he be both most learned and very well acquaint with the variety and vicissitude of courtier condition o what be man life but hope fear anxious between both which we doubtful live and die not much unlike unto this be that elegant distich alas what be life hope fear of future thing whence little pleasure much displeasure spring assure it be most true that all good man whether courtier noble commons yea all of we of what so ever condition we be do spend our space and term of life in good hope and ill hap moreover that courtier which hope after great a good observation for courtier matter in the court can never make any great progress therein if he can brook and be impatient of contumely or know not how to endure scoff taunt or mockery let he therefore with patience undertake this journey and weave the web of this life with these manner and demenor namely let he please all man part with what he have observe the time and season let he learn to cover and discover his nature yea let he turn and wind himself hither and thither which way soever occasion require to be sorry with those that be full of sigh merry with those that be full of mirth grave with old man and grateful to young man and unless the courtier be skilful in this art he can neither grow great nor long continue therein but wretched and miserable be those court of king wherein no man endeavour either by honesty learning or industry to ascend the step to honour and dignity but where all man either lawful or unlawful by right or by wrong they care not how no man by his own merit or desert strive to attain unto dignity power and preferment endeavour not thou kind courtier to creep into office and authority by any other mean than only by virtue and laudable course if thou receive a repulse and another inferior unto patience in the court be a excellent endowment thou both by lineage virtue and learning be prefer before thou yet notwithstanding take it patient and with a content mind and do not revenge thy own quarrel by impious wrath or perfidious and nefarious treachery it be very behooveful for a wise courtier to follow evermore the most mighty and powerful personage and as it be to follow the very tract and footstep of the most favour and fortunate but ever with this caveat that he do it no otherwise than will stand with honesty or equity let the courtier never hunt after o^ eager desire of the suit and desire of a courtier must be honest his prince any such thing which can be have without infamy and ignominious disgra^e with whatsoever show or veil of honesty or utility they may seem for a season to be overspread and cover peradventure it may seem pleasant delicate and delightful be varnish over and garnish with a beautiful and probable colour of profit or pleasure but it can long continue so for it will quick be turn to shame and bitterness it may perchance as I say before admit some certain mantle of modesty or cloak of honesty and so deceive and delude thou but be assure that that which in itself be filthy or shameful can by no mean be honest let the courtier therefore take heed that he delight not or delude not himself with good ill get which will in the end undoubted turn to his own destruction let the courtier also especial consider and meditate this one thing that notwithstanding that the wicked and dishonest man may cover and conceal his action from public view yet his conscience within will like Cain never suffer he to trust himself again let the courtier know thus much that indeed wicked and ungodly malefactor may by favour or good fortune escape the punishment of their villainy but not from the terror and guiltiness thereof in their conscience for proof whereof let these true and excellent ensue verse give thou full satisfaction and assurance commiseri^ Turpi infamy if thou do aught laborious yet if it honest be thy name and same most glorious shall rest from pain most free but if with pleasure and delight thou work a wicked fact thy pleasure soon will take his flight shame stay and credit be crack but let the wise and cautolous courtier diminish or the courtier joy or sorrow must be measure by the weal or woe of his prince measure out his pleasure care trouble or molestation according the health safety sickness or bad condition of his prince and let he not his prince be dead like certain proud pseudopostle and bloody factious and nefarious jesuit far from any show of sorrow and lamentation sing a for his departure but let he rather in a lawful honest and religious manner condole his death and immature departure in who only life consist as many time it fall out the life of a infinite many more by who death a entire region yea a whole kingdom church and commonweal have endure a unspeakable loss and detriment in a ungodly and a ungracious courtier over much wealth discover what man be prosperity do unlock and lay open to public view his avarice pride and all other intestine hideous vice whatsoever that former lie lurk with in he it be therefore no marvel though they have be lift and mount up to the top of honour and preferment possess to much riches and worldly felicity be sudden ruinate and precipitate into the bottom of bitter calamity example hereof be too many and too manifest both in this bless island and in France both ancient and modern I say not leave in the register of antiquity or report of people but fresh and palpable object to our eye and understanding wherefore in this respect let the courtier be wise and wary to consider that he which too hasty and to high climb up be likely most lowly and lamentable to tumble down and to this purpose hear what a great and most learned doctor say what ever fickle fortune lift on high she soon throw down in the meane most safety moreover let the courtier attempt all his enterprise to be private or secret in his intention and employment smooth current and private without any the least rumour or report of what he intend to do let he I say use all diligence hate all arrogance and in the very act itself be as private and silent as a man a sleep the reason hereof why thus he shall perform his action I have already declare which here with the reader patience I shut up in silence I only add thus much and it be indeed a shame to be speak yet such be the property and ungodly guise of most court that gift and bribe present be the present and chief preparation to remove all the rub and to make the way plain to grace favour and preferment but the true noble and illustrious courtier which have learn by virtue a better way than by fawn favour and insinuate friendship to rise and raise himself to honour and dignity be better to want both place and grace than to acquire or desire his honour by gift and reward yet it be true which Sallust that most grave and learned historian say especial of the court of Rome that all thing be set to sail at Rome so be they for the most part at many other court where little or nothing be give with out gold or gain and therefore his suit must needs be cold that want the help of Gold nay if we will believe the impious abuse of the court of Rome touch even the imposition or lay on of hand and the gift of the holy ghost be sell for money yea I say the very pardon and forgiveness of sin be in the court of Rome make only a money matter they which know the court of Rome and that monstrous great hireling of Rome himself do know that I tell no fabulous fiction but know too well to the cost of many of they that he and his courtier be of Titus Vespasian opinion that the send and savour of gain be sweet by what mean soever it be get this imposture deceivable juggler and pesantly pedlar do foster and favour under he such cunning cozner and shark shifter as scarce with a good conscience or credit do use not from urine or stale but even from strumpet jew grecian and barbarian to scrape together and even wipe their nose of myriad and million of gold and treasure I here omit the epicurious glutton the refuse offal and scum of all man who when they once like raven harpy begin to hunger and gape after gain will bring the wealthy man though never so honest within the danger of their devilish inquisition but let every wise and discreet courtier hate and repudiate all such unhonest wile and juggle trick and whatsoever favour money or stipend he shall by any mean procure and store up in court let he not for the present great regard they but in such a manner respect his riches and expect his remuneration or reward even as though he be not much trouble with the thought thereof since riches as the philosopher say do sometime accompany the unworthy and as the proverb be be either impious or unjust or else unjust heir of what they possess whatsoever wealth or riches therefore thou do desire to acquire in the court let thy eager appetite or solicitous endeavour for they be unknown rather than see and show forth that be seem rather to have seek than to seek they moreover that courtier or any else whatsoever he be to put our hope in practice be not to be commend which hope for great matter and yet attempt very few let such a one know that the say of that most sage philosopher and sweet orator be most authentical and true in that virtue consist not in word but in work that courtier therefore which desire and endeavour to promote and raise his estate and fortune must serious and sedulous consider and have a care that he be spare of speech and most diligent and industrious in the expedition of his affair for a man mind and his matter take in hand must ever go together and agree in one if he expect any praise thereby as every stupidity work therefore which the courtier undertake must be far from stupidity or remissness so also from temereity temereity and rashness and he certain which be thus careful need not deject and reject his hope though peradventure the prince who he serve do not present repay his honesty and diligence with a princely benevolence for many time it be with he as with other ausert forbearance be no acquittance and how know thou or why shall thou not hope but that he may in his princely magnificence reserve a great benefit or reward for a wise and faithful courtier wherefore faint not fear not for although elsewhere delay may prove dangerous yet here it be otherwise where ofttimes procrastination prove commodious nor indeed be it fit we shall prescribe bound and limit to a prince bounty and liberality but rather patient to expect for beggar as our english proverb be must be no carver such a content courtier questionless howsoever the case stand with he for the present yet he ever retain in his consultation reason and honesty and let both these be always as a light to direct he yea let these be the path he mean to tread in not turn out of they to the right hand or to the left but take thou no pleasure in the condition of crafty not to praise any action by the event and subtle courtier who in their life and conversation do so carry themselves as that by the event they will high praise and approve prosperous thing though never so shameful and dishonest and contrariwise will dispraise and disprove adverse thing though never so honest and unblamable but let all honest heart courtier I say eschew and avoid such vile and servile quality and base condition and let they with i thus hearty wish and desire o may he want a hopeful happy end which by the issue do the act commend the wise and well experience courtier have to do to know man condition and to be well read in history with diverse and sundry man must as various as wary bear and behave himself with they all which he may easy do if he be well acquaint with their quality and condition but especial if he be well see in history out of which he shall learn and discern that the genius and disposition of the Spaniard be different to the nature and inclination of the italian the italian to the french and the french to the german and thence may the wise and politic courtier see and perceive their variety and diversity but what I now admonish and advise thou of I wish may be lay up and keep safe in the most secret closet of thy heart and memory namely that there be a most pestiferous kind of courtier who for filthy Lucre sake will avouch and confirm falshold for truth who will praise any thing which they have by relation or report either from the prince or common people whither it be honest or dishonest yea and which on the other side will with the prince or people vilipend and dispraise any thing whatsoever be it never so commendable change like Polypus not their superficies or outward colour but even alter their mind and understanding with the change and mutation of their place of abode certain such courtier as these do never take any care to keep a pure or unspotted conscience to God nor a good report towards their neighbour but let we consider both king prince and courtier yea all man both public and private whatsoever that there be above and about we a ear to hear a eye to see and a book wherein all our word and deed be write and record and that therefore in whatsoever kind and condition of life we live we especial choose and make choice of piety and integlitie as our chief guide therein and let we be most cautelous and careful that when we labour by all mean to gain the grace and favour of our earthly sovereign we thereby lose not the love of our celestial saviour o let we mark and remember this that the conscience be maculate and contaminate with sin and impiety beget a worm which will gnaw there eternal but contrariwise that the conscience which be beautiful specious and free from gross enormity do wonderful conserve nourish and cherish in we the special grace and favour of the almighty while I advise and admonish these thing i think those unconscionable untutre and unlearned courtier and such as be ignorant of this human condition may and that most just listen to i who to the end they may intercept and stop up the way from better and more learned man than themselves by cunning craft and subtle stratagem do imagine mischief and destruction yea and as much as in they lie do press and oppress man most worthy eternal laud and memory for there be nothing doubtless more usual and customary in the court than with malice lie and calumniation to curb keep under and ensnare most excellent and eminent man yea such as have marvelous well deserve of the common wealth by who alas too often and therefore the more lamentable even the good discreet and wise prince himself be by they sell for gold and gain furthermore unless I be much deceive I have note difference between a courtier and a soldier and observe this difference between a soldier and a courtier namely that the soldier for the most part use plain and apparent to express and exercise his hatred and displeasure and to speak that with his tongue which he intend in his heart but contrariwise the courtier I mean the sly subtle and deceivable courtier will cog counterfeit cousin and dissemble his hatred if time and occasion do give he leave wherefore such as these in time of peace and in a calm and quiet estate and condition of thing may easy supplant and overthrow the plain and unarmed soldier moreover let the courtier remember this one thing to wit that he very (@) and careful carry himself as well against injury already receive as against those which be offer and that he keep and protect himself safe and secure from they both let the courtier also of give council in doubtful matter know that to be able to give council in uncertain and doubtful affair do purchase the favour and affection of other which doubtful business if they be so anxious and intricate that thou can not deliver thy opinion of they without manifest danger and detriment than it be far better and more safe to confess thy want and honest and sober to excuse the same than either to plunge thyself into error or they into pernicious danger let the discreet courtier also speak of his prince how to carry himself towards his prince be absent when he be absent as though he where present will thou know the reason with patience hear it and I shall willing show it assure this be undeniable that almost in every court envy and avarice do stand up in a corner behind the paint cloth but flattery and ambition will confront and out face thou let the courtier therefore I say be advise vigilant and that I may again speak with Homer as former a front and a that be watch on all side for such will seem in show to be thy friend who indeed be nothing less who artificial and envious will coin and forge new term and quaint phrase thereby to induce thou to say somewhat touch thy prince all this while aim and level at no other mark than that thou may be induce either to make some ill report of he or to entrap thou by some crafty or captious apprehension of thy speech wherein thou may seem to offend he absent whereof have himself be present to hear he never have make any ill construction wherefore let the courtier be of Polypus mind to take upon he diverse condition and disposation several shape and show as time and place shall repuire yet never digress from equity and honesty again let the majesty dignity and authority of thy prince be always so reverent have in remembrance by thou that even be absent thou so behave thyself towards he as if he be present and suffer not thy tongue at any time to let slip the least syllable which may be either disgraceful to he or prejudicial to thyself modesty in a other kind of life do excellent season of modesty or bashfulness and set forth virtue but in court to be bashful and not tocarry himself bold as if he come of a base or mean parentage be most distasteful and disgraceful in the court yet let the courtier then take heed that he besot not himself with over much modesty which the ethic do not improper or imprudent call frigidity or coldness of courage pusilanimity or faint heartedness for he which thus undiscreet withdraw or pull himself back be never call to the execution of important affair nor in any notable or excellent employment assistant or serviceable to his prince shall never be capable of promotion or preferment let the courtier likewise wise avoid to much shamefastness that be such a excess or extremity therein as come most near to rusticity and sottishness whereby we can scarce do almost any thing but that we blush and seem to be a shame thereat notwithstanding that the thing which we do be honest and laudable certain this disposition or motion of the mind be a silly servant to regal or majestical government and sure if ever this affection or disposition be to be put away it be as well here in the court as in the martiall-camp certain that courtier shall be esteem true noble and renown among the most eminent and illustrious who in all the action and office of his life show himself immovable constant a contemner of riches a firm keeper and maintainer of what be just and honest and which can with a constant and courageous spirit pass by and bear patient the unjust menace taunt and threaten of any what ere they be the courtier which thus behave and carry himself and may peradventure at one time or other incur the displeasure of his prince and be environ and hedge about with the deceit and subtlety of his envious enemy yet let he still by all mean entertain a good hope and honest cogitation of his prince for it may so come to pass that he who to day be incense with anger against thou may tomorrow be reconcile to thou and to this purpose let the notable example of Mordochai and Haman of joseph David Daniel and many such like move and admonish thou herein it be almost unutterable how much a good and just of a clear conscience cause that be a clear conscience may prevail listen unto and learn this kind courtier I advise thou that in every estate and condition of life thou make use of that rule which be prescribe by that wise and witty poet. sirecte fancy to do well be a wall of brass within aguiltlesse heart not blame or shame with sin a good conscience be indeed liken to a brazen wall for bias that famous philosopher be ask by one what it be that can be absolute free from fear in this life make answer that it be a good conscience wherefore let a man have ever a reputation or report and a clear conscience as it be two strong wall of brass to oppugn and oppose all the calumniation contumely and detraction of his malignant enemy yea I add this also that a man that be faithful conscious of his own innocence shall not be move or molest with unjust slander or backbite nor shall he think it a matter of more import and consequence to hear himself ill speak of by another than to bear in himself the testimony of his own integrity and uprightness and let not only courtier but even all man of whatsoever place and condition of life as well peer as peasant father as child as well the rich as the poor have recourse to this haven of happiness and fly to this sanctuary for safeguard final who soever intend wise and discreet to manage and order his life either in public affair let he what ere he be or young or old make this provision hereon take fast hold but I stray to far therefore I come to the matter let not the wise and understand courtier be too urgent or instant for the undertake of such ambiguous rigid or to take heed what business he undertake intricate matter which he know or fear may prove distasteful and contrary to the desire and expectation of his prince notwithstanding that he can yield some reason and probabillity for the same but let he rather either utter be silent or at least deal therein very spare and indifferent and to this purpose let he learn in obscure anxious and doubtful business to express a more benign dulcide and gentle opinion and all rigour be remove and set a part let he so far forth as the thing itself will admit work and win his prince to the most soft and smooth sense or signification thereof especial if he himself be voluntary incline there unto now let the courtier know and understand this to be the court never empty of falsheartednesse most true which have be else where former touch that court be never empty of feign friendship and secret snare and subtlety which do for the most part lurk and mask themselves either in the simulation of courteous office or in some bond of encroach familiarity and acquaintance but be very watchful to beware of these ensnare involution entrap turn and wind and of these perilous and pernicious rock for true here be need not only of wisdom but even of good luck as I may so say and a fortunate estate and condition in the interim if any fortification or protection may munition against false-heartedness shield succour or descend thou go forward to arm and fortify thyself with this munition and excellent furniture here follow first every thy mind with knowledge variety of matter and language but especial be expert in history a skilful lawyer and a wise politician furnish with solid counsel and a discreet and sweet utterance of speech as also a exquisite and excellent penman be courteous of speech grave in thy style rare garnish with the liberal Sciencs neat in apparel and a bountiful house keeper assure that courtier which have furnish himself with these instrument and ornament if he achieve not hereby the amity and affection of the most yet may he certain avoid the sly collourable and counterfeit snare and treachery of many and with much praise and commendation to himself wise and just delude his enemy the courtier also be desirous to free and clear of gift or present himself from the least occasion of offence by he give may make the way clear to he by give gift and present and indeed the old proverb testify this to be true which say that even the god be win by gift and Seneca relate the apothegne or witty say of a certain philosopher say thus to take or receive be the sweet thing of all nor be these thing repugnant or contradictory to those afore specify and this be indeed most certain that the sore and swell of a court must of necessity be mollify and soften with those like poultesy and heal plaster whereby we may assuage and mitigate the wicked and perverse quality and condition of man and the most vicious and pernicious custom and practice of this our age. wherein as the poet testify man be by gift beguile the god appease yea jupiter himself by gift be please (@) of Plat^ be worthy remembrance the god the great king love he which gift do bring wherefore let the courtier use sometime this beneficence and liberality especial towards those who he know he have offend and who he be persuade his riches and possession may very much resist and withstand questionless if there be any hammer or wedge wherewith to pierce penetrate or clean in sunder the most obdurate and stubborn heart of man it be this namely gift or reward yet here again it be not idle but worth the question whither the courtier himself may also receive gift again we may answer with a (...) the emperor observe this neither may he take all thing nor at all time nor from all man but each of these discreet and wise for as in all other matter two extreme be to be avoid namely excess and defect even so it be here for the extremity of defect be not to receive aught from any man which be very inhuman and uncivil and the extremity of excess be always to receive all whatsoever be proffer which be most vile and avaricious those courtier be to be high commend who receive small reward and that very spare from man of abusive bribery of mean estate or condition especial for the propagation and necessary execution of equine and justice but let they rather with a free heart and a grateful mind accept of what be for that cause confer upon they by their prince himself but those courtier be contrariwise most worthy detestation and bitter execration which do sell justice and truth for gold and gain let the courtier therefore think upon that which that most wise otatour and philosopher Cicero make mention of in the second book of his office commendation be and the basis or foundation of eternal fame and commendation be justice without which nothing can by any mean be praise worthy excellent also say that noble historian Ius it be say that equity be often force from verity yet it can never be utter extinguish or put out let not therefore any gain any gift though never so sweet never so sumptuous no pleasant enticement or inducement of honour favour or affection move the honest and conscionable coutty from the love and true delight of justice and equity let young man also and such as be but new initiate not to admit too young man too soon into office in a court. courtier be dispose of in the more inferior place of office or employment nor be it indeed fit that any one shall be mount up to the high step of dignity except he have by virtue fidelity and industry ascend the same for this we do firm hold and constant conclude that Arcadius and honorius be of a honest and upright opinion who say that whosoever do rise to dignity and honour shall not by any mean obtain it by ambition but by much labour and industrious acquisition mere drone therefore be those courtier yea dry sponge and blood-suching hore-leache who neither be deck with any eminent virtue nor adorn with the beautiful flourish of elegant learning no not decorate with any pleasant delicacy or delightfulness of manner and humanity yet for all this do intercept forestall and encroach into those dignity and preferment those riches and commodity which by due desert and merit belong and most true appertain to other more worthy and more learned than they again let not any courtier of whatsoever condition of proud brag or ostentation order and rank show himself a vain glorious Braggad^chi^ in the presence of his prince and if he know that by any exquisite seemliness dexterity grace or favour he be excellent prevalent and powerful yet let he nor arrogate the same to his own singularity but whole ascribe all thing to his prince favour bounty and benignity as have receive they from he and render due thanks to he for the same for it may so come to pass that thy prince for thy ambition and vainglorious ostentation may say to a stranger come up hither but to the thrasonical and fond insult courtier go down low and learn to humble thyself now whither of these two be the better and most please speech let the wise and understand courtier judge and heedful consider doubtless these thing can be too much move nor admonish in vain because as marshal say rich (@) can b^rdly hide their quality and few be thrifty when to wealth they rise think upon yea and in time ruminate and recogitate that of the most wise king Solamon pro. 29. and a man pride shall bring he low but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit intimate thereby that the lord will cast down and punish pride but that he will magnify and exalt the humble and meek furthermore it be most decent and befit the wise of drunkenness or surfeit courtier or counsellor especial to abstain from the immoderate or rather beastlike abuse of wine because where drunkenness reign there assure can no secret be keep secret excellent indeed be that greek and latin sentence and worthy here to be remember quoth in cord that which be in the heart of a sober man be in the tongue of a drunkard I will not here recite the large description which Horace make of the effect of drunkenness but yet I can omit nor let pass the distich which Virgil have to this purpose in his epigram for procreations sake and thirst just use drink wine but more engender gross abuse touch this also Ovid write thus drink not too much or if so be it such as only cheer the heart for more hurt much let the courtier therefore in this respect manage or demean himself according to the direct rule of reason and let he always contain himself within the bound of modest sobriety and firm keep and conserve this wholesome and healthful form and demeanour of his life and conversation that he do not any otherwise cocker or pamper his body than only be sufficient to the conservation of the health and strength thereof let his meat only satisfy hunger and his drink only quench his thirst but I shoot beyond the mark therefore I return to of petition the matter it be a very customary and usual thing in courtier to delay and put of the answer of petition from day to day and we read that this be the practice of Roboam who use to say to his suitor and petitioner i depart till three day hence and then come again to i he doubtless which take notice of this delay and procrastination and yet persist to petition to such a one do for the most part but loose as the proverb be both his cost and his care let that courtier therefore which be wise in due time desist from such fruitless exhibit of petition and so unprofitable to solicit and move they with helpless importunity do thou proceed to petition and entreat what can thou expect or hope to obtain assure nothing but either no answer or at the most a harsh and unsavoury answer which indeed be most common hold in court to be a fit and sufficient answer to poor man petition furthermore like as many man be such blab and babbler that even those thing which have long time lie hide and undiscovered yet they will at one time or other broach and spread they abroad as thing most fresh and new revive so let not the honest and discreet courtier present publish what he have conceive in his heart but then also let he very advise watch and expect a convenient time and a occasion most fit for he intend purpose moreover the courtier which have now spend much the reward of many courtier time make a large progress in the court and have there suffer and set light by many molestation yea much toil and travel let he not much admire or wonder that he have with a courage and immovable mind do well therein because the reward and remuneration of courtier labour be for the most part to grow wise and repent what they have do he therefore which write these witty and true verse be doubtless sensible of the truth of they by experimental proof Contrini i silly wretch most wretched have spend much time at court in taste evil many in thankfulness in hope but small content yet yield due observance unto any and now for all my labour what be the prize but late repentance and to grow more wise certain it be most miserable and lamentable which I herein write and yet ^ost true notable and too well know for how many have there at all time be be there (...) there be who condition jump ingratitude oft time in the court. (@) with th^^ that where as they have be excellent (@) and have most worthy deserve of their commonweal yet for their notable and meritorious action have undergo most disgraceful and immerited requital let we consider and call to mind in what reputation live Parmenio with Alexander Eusenides with Ptolemy the king Pannonianus with Alcimenides Aratus Sigonius with Philip of Macedon let we also remember what a most illustrious and renown captain and commander be aetius in grace and greatness of authority in the day of the emperor Val^etinian nor may I here omit that famous warrior and most valiant commander against who alas what other cause of so great cruelty can justinian ever find out save only mere surmise and unjust suggest suspicion who hereupon after the vandal and persian be by he discomfit and overthrow be disgraceful degrade from all his honour and dignity his eye lamentable put out be thus force to get his live by beg on the high way by many other example I can amplify and exemplify this truth which for diverse just c^^ses I hold sit in silence to be pretermit as be very unwilling to give offence by too large describe the inconstancy of a courtly condition and fortune yet that I may not seem also too much to sooth and dissemble with thou kind courtier but to deal plain and faithful I will hear only add that most worthy sentence of Plutar^h in the life of Aratus which indeed I hold most worthy due respect credit eternal memory and observation among all great peer and flourish potentate whatsoever a^repentine and and the friendship and affection of king be for the time very hot and hasty and they be as it be inflame with a certain repentine and sudden heat of love but soon alas and very easy may it be extinguish and quite quench and themselves be daily drive or blow to and fro with the wind of envy and blast of backbite emulatour wherefore kind courtier since the case stand thus with thou and that Solamon in his proverb seem to hit the same wight when he say when thou sit down to eat with a ruler or mighty man consider diligent what be before thou and put a knife to thy throat that thou may save thy own life with very great reason say the same king also that the wrath of a king be the messenger of death yet notwithstanding all this courteous courtier I advise thou circumspect and wary to wade through all these with a good and a gracious hope and do not at any time so far distrust thy own virtuous endowment and immaculate conscience but that notwithstanding some adverse and cross time thou may easy overcome the danger-obuious familaritie and affection of a prince especial if thou happy happen to live with a prince that be pious prudent virtuous and a lover of honesty neither be thou herein too low deject with fear and doubt but that although through defect and want of judgement or by erroneous unadvisedness thou may have both say and do somewhat contrary to the will and pleasure of the prince and he therefore prevent thy hope and determination may let loose the seine of his power and authority to take revenge upon thou yet for all this it may so come to pass that he may return to himself be better (@) and in the end submit himself to the rule of God word to justice equity and reason especial I say if he be a christian prince but as touch those which have reject and cast from they the sweet and easy yoke of Christ jesus which do all by this rule thus will I have it this be my command my lust be just my will for law shall stand but as they I say have nothing to do with Christ helpfulness to other require in a wise courtier so we have nothing to say to they here also I advise exhort the wise courtier that if God have give unto he more wisdom dignity authority virtue and such like excellent endowment than to many other that he than consider with himself that he be so much the more oblige and bind to be helpful and assistant to his neighbour yea and that both God and nature yea all wise man do consent herein that it be very behooveful and befit all man to be profitable helpful one to another let not any courtier therefore in this respect exalt and magnify himself or set up the plume of his pride above other but let he in the fear of the lord make a modest and right use of God gift namely that by how much he excel other and be more excellent and eminent than they in the exquisite ornament of wit or some other singular virtue so much the more lowly let he prize and esteem himself be always mindful hereof that to who much be give of he will the great master and prince of heaven exact and require much again let the courtier therefore be very modest gentle and beneficial to other or apt to pleasure and do good to all man for herein shall he indeed most near imitate God himself but since the courtier according to the opinion of the common people live a soft sumptuous and delicate life and be continual conversant and exercise about some noble subject or other namely in do service to his prince who be he that can true term that man a good courtier in who the virtue and endowment as well of the body as of the mind do not due concur namely a desire to be in action and employment furnish with noble thought excellent quality and condition heroic exploit and of a speech well season and temper with wit and facetious pleasantness assure let he which perchance be either ignorant hereof or unfurnish herewith know and understand thus much from i that it be not enough for a man to swell and puff himself up with pride of some vain and bare name of a courtier or with the image and stock of honourable progenitor yea or with the title and indeed tittle of nobility or fleet dignity and final that I may speak with Grispus the historian to seem but not to be the same he make show of but this rather I say be the thing which be especial require that he which desire to be honour and adorn either by the court or any other estate or condition of life let he first adorn and beautify it in himself but never shall he acquire or attain (@) I mean with due desert this ornament this excellency if he addict and devote himself to ignoble and base cloth and idleness to voluptuousness vain and unfruitful pleasure to toy and foolery yea and if he show himself a unprofitable burden to the earth he live on and catterpiller-like life only to devour and destroy the fruit thereof but if he be beautify adorn and decorate with those excellent part above specify furthermore let not a courtier strive beyond measure of praise to extol and magnify his prince with glorious praise and gloss phrase for as wise man will certain be offend if thou too bitter and sharp taunt and reprehend they so questionless will true wise man take it in exceed ill part to be too extreme and vehement commend praise all thing therefore spare indifferent and in due season for as it be in other thing so here also to observe (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) a decorum be always very profitable and praise worthy now even as a physician in heal a sickness and in cure a malady or disease member have a special care that while he apply the plaster or medicine to one member he hurt not the other even so let the courtier or courtly counsellor so advise his prince that he will so provident and prudent provide and take care for his common wealth as that in protect the one part thereof he destroy not the other especial by exaction of money and heavy taxation let he also put his prince in mind of that of Tiberius if at any time a fit a excellent observation and opportune occasion happen to wit that it be the property of a good shepherd to take his sheep fleece but not to slay their skin over their ear so likewise when he see any collector of money too eager or oppressive exact and extract from other let he then imitate Alexander the great who be move and urge by some about he that he may very well impose large mulct tribute and subsidy upon his city thus answer I hate that gardener which a princely say pull up the herb by the root assure it be a most pious princelike and renown say yea it be a speech most befit so regal and royal a prince as himself be for what can be more shameful and absurd in a prince or any other great peer than with Vespasian to desire gain yea though it be out of foul and filthy stale or urine moreover it be a foul shame for a courtier to be ignorant what a courtier must not be ignorant of of and unacquainted with the state condition and potency of prince the science and knowledge of counselor the original of family and especial all the true token and badge of honour and such like of those region kingdom or country wherein peradventure upon his prince command he be to live and to execute any honourable embassage again it be very pertinent to the knowledge of a prudent courtier that he understand and know how many castle office of eminency wood pond and such like be belong to his prince what and how many soldier they train up in military discipline how many and how well fortify city as also how many worthy man who have be educate in the most famous academy of Europe and be exquisite instruct in all the science true it be unspeakable to declare what especial mean of honour and advancement it be for the courtier to be thorough insighted and experience in these thing and (@) (@) disgrace and discredit it (@) he to (@) and dumb when he be question concern all (@) of these now the chief and especial mean to know these thing very perfect be out of history and antiquity nor be I able indeed sufficient to exhort sti^u^ antiquity and stimulate the courtier to the most serious sedulous and constant read of they for out of this ^ouhtaine especial out of the storehouse of the sacred scripture courtier may collect and draw forth this knowledge sacred scripture that it be not sufficient only to know what be just and right but that they must of necessity do the same note this for so say the text of holy writ fact^ (@) it be not enough only to know the will of God unless indeed and action we perform the same and to this purpose I think it worth my labour to add this distich of a uncertain author most worthy due observation of all good man what profit it to read much much to know if badness thou embrace goodness forego furthermore let the courtier contemn and abstain from all lie cheat simulation and dissimulation let he here listen unto that most grave and godly father saint Augustine give he honest and religious counsel a good note lingu and vit^^ my friend let thy tongue be silent and be careful to examine thy life and why because indeed it be more assure know and discern what a man be by his fruit that be by his work then by his word that courtier which the term of his abode in not to depend whole on prince this this transitory and frail court on earth be terminate and expire do look and long for a place in that perpetual palace in heaven after that he have see observe and collect both out of sacred and profane writing what soever the wit of man be capable of and able to comprehend yet let he call to mind that of the psalmist and sweet singer of Israel and with he conclude that it be better far to trust in God alone than in a thousand king in regal throne and again he which on God depend sail with best wind for prince blast of love prove most unkind now before I put a period and full conclusion to this my labour and little treatise I must true tell thou kind courtier this one thing namely that the court make not a man better but man rather may make the court itself better whereby I will intimate thus much that it be not enough to live in court to go to bed at midnight mark this to rise the next morning at ten a clock and then what with apparel himself with frizzle and curl his hair with his curl pin with powder and turn up the fame this way and that way about his ear continue thus in his bed chamber even till noon at least and then to spend the rest of the day in feast jest and many such like toy and trivial exercise and practice assure I say and let every courtier believe i that he which be only occupy and busy in crop these rose shall undoubted find then but prick thorn on these tree shall find nothing but fruitless leaf shall find these vine both wild and barren in these garner shall find nothing but chaff and final in these treasury shall be possess of nothing but mere counterfeit mettle the courtier I say which adhere cleave and be incline to these thing above mention can right undertake excogitate do or begin to do any thing much less perfect finish or effect the same he also which clear not himself of these thing shall find many defect in himself and such as that if he mend not his manner will give he just cause to weep and lament let not that courtier therefore think himself a happy and fortunate man which in the court have power to live as he list for if courtier be which I will to the lord they be the most absolute happy and perfect of all man then assure they which will not present profess and embrace a courtier life may wander as the say be all the world over since we all know that there be no time of a man life that can be better spend than that which be spend and bestow in the sweet fellowship of wise and learned man yea of such as be famous for their wisdom and excellent part and employment therefore that I may once for all more perspicuous unfold and lay open my full scope meaning and intention herein this I say be the thing which I especial aim at to admonish thou kind courtier namely that since even court also have their bramble brier and thistle no man shall therefore put too much confidence and hope in himself notwithstanding all the glitter and glorious show and resplendent lustre of a courtly life and so by that mean alienate and estrange himself from his god but that he shall always bear in remembrance how many at all time in king court have be press yea with lie detraction and envy oppress and that much sorrow be shelter and hide under that glorious misery and indeed who can term it otherwise than a glorious misery when a man shall so live and in such a place where for the most part he be still subject either to the danger of other man malice and hatred these be not only the condition of courtier but of this age in general or else himself to have other in hatred and detestation where a man in outward show of reverence with cap and knee make bare his head to he who head in his heart he desire be smite off other again to be see to bow themselves low and even make a leg to he in the work of who destruction they can be better content to break their leg again be it not a thing much to be lament to see man daily to frequent each other company to laugh and rejoice together and yet all this while to foster within their breast most cruel and capital enmity and hatred each against other be it not intolerable yea incredible dissimulation that a man shall i^ his heart bid a mischief go with he to who he outward ^alneth much worship and reverence o misery I say not now glorious but most gross and gri^^ous yea most unbefitting a (@) and generous nobleman these thing kind courtier be most true nor yet do I fly from the judgement and censure which I know you yourselves may urge and infer herein but this we must hold and be assure of as a infallible truth that neither the courtier nor any what so (@) he be may well leave of to complain of himself until such (@) as ^^ do begin to amend himself for certain as it be a great folly and mere madness f^r^^m (@) and perfequl without (@) to (@) pursue the th^^ft which (@) and be close hide i^ (@) of the house so it be a manifest token of great want of experience in we that when we see ourselves ^^^^ult we blush not nor be a jot ashamed to lay it upon other and to justify ourselves to ^^ke it appear yet more plain by example how every man be the cause of his own misery come it to pass that we so travail up and down both at home and abroad that we so pine pinch and punish ourselves that we so often break our sleep by rise up early and go late to bed what necessity urge or constrain ^s hereunto but a insatiate desire to satisfy our un-bridled lust who I pray make we so proud but even our own madness who be it that fetter our (@) in the gyve and shackle of envy and malice but our own natural defect who be it that as it be inflame and kindle the fire of wrath and fury in all our inward part but our own impotence and impatiency in brief that I may abstract abrevia^ and epitomize the subject and argument of this whole treatise into the narrow list and limit of one line let the courtier hereof be most wary and heedful that out of himself he draw a rule to rectify and govern his own life that he be content to taste the sour with the sweet and in court to expect as well burdensome blame and injury as beautiful fame and dignity yea let he know and know assure that he which enter into the court enter into such a kind of life as comprehend much more labour and care than ease and quietness final let he thus conclude that our whole life do overflow and abound with various yea great and grievous care affair and employment from which that the courtier may at last be set at liberty let he accept and make use of this my counsel if at lest which I hope it may prove honest and wholesome unto he when soever he determine to bid farewell and to wholesome admonition for every courtier take his vale of the court let he be whole exercise and employ in pious read and divine meditation with a constant and courageous mind let he deride and laugh to scorn the vanity of this world and send back this news to hope and fortune itself and have once find the haven of rest and quietness let he with a free heart and a cheerful voice say my hauen sound fortuen and hope adieu mock other now for ^ have do with you and true since it be so excessive hard for any man to carry and demean himself in every kind of life so as that he (@) in any thing therefore kind Courti^^ recei^^ these other most short remedy herein first th^^ be thou (@) of firm assure that then thou have find out wisdom when thou d^st true lament thy own evil past do wisele vilipend all seem good thing St. Barnard and do hearty (@) and desire the best thing to come also if thy affection and desire be true settle and fix they where our head and heavenly king our lord and saviour Christ jesus do rule and reign in blissful eternity if then kind and courteous courtier thou be of this mind and bless resolution thou shall easy and true understand that it be not the safe way to rely and only to trust to the world or any prince palace for the world pass away and all the pleasure thereof but he which do the will of the lord he shall endure for ever be advise then ^o be advise good courtier I exhort the^ which short do desire to relinquish and forsake this sickle frail and impure court on earth and to be thence (...) state and transport into the eternal most pure and perfect court of heaven hold fast this resolution (@) by way obstacle obstruction and impediment hinder or with hold thy progress and constant proceed in this right rhode and king highway nor let any thing reduce or seduce thou from that life to come in which be that day which admit no night and out last all eternity of time now that thou may elect and make choice of a holy and happy course of life consider with thyself what thou now be whence and for what cause thou be and then thou shall find that oblivion be our first original our middle be be labour and our end be sorrow and what be all these be knit and conjoin together assure nothing else than most apparent and manifest error what need many word man whole life be spend and pass over in hope well and have ill now therefore courteous courtier here will I conclude with these three brief the conclusion of all with three brief note observation which I desire thou will always keep in perpetual remembrance and in court always bear about thou namely that in heaven above there be a ear which over-heare thou a eye which over-sees thou and a book whereinto all thy word and deed be most curious and careful write these be the thing thrice noble and renown which I have humble presume and think good to deliver and set forth in writing touch the life of a courtier which I have especial do for the honour of the court of the most magnificent JAMES king of great Britain etc. indeed I know and do ingenuous agnize that I have omit above a thousand thing which may worthy have be express concern the dignity honour and gravity of this argument yet howsoever hereof I be most confident persuade and assure that I have herein accomplish and collect those thing which may in some measure delineate and display the life manner and demeanour yea the lively image similitude and portraiture of a court and courtier and I hope not altogether obscure demonstrate to every courtier what he be to follow and embrace what to fly and utter contemn and unless I be most gross and palpable deceive the courtier if he do not unkind neglect and reject these rule precept and prescription but bring they to practic proof and trial by daily custom and exercise shall have some matter object to the eye of his understanding wherein as in a mirror or lookingglass (@) (@) of all (@) intend ^^ the court
