sudden he see a ugly and deform army of devil to fight against he with iron spit who intend as the saint know by the inward illustration of the holy ghost to assail his monastery and to kill with their point stake many of his monk but he albeit all alone take s. Paul armour and fight courageous against the whole host of his infernal adversary and so the conflict continue for the most part of the day neither can they overcome he nor yet he drive they out of his isle until the angel come to his help who terror make the devil depart after their departure the saint prophesy how they will invade the monastery of and inflict pestilent disease on the inhabitant whereof many will die within two day likewise the saint foretell how Bathaneus by the help of prayer and fast preserve his monastery from their invasion in so much that none die but one 4. in the middle region of Ireland live a certain smith a man much addict to alm deed and other good work when this virtuous artisan come to the final period of his mortal life the saint speak to a few that be about he in this manner the smith do not labour in vain who with the labour of his hand have purchase everlasting reward his soul be now carry by the angel to the joy of the heavenly country another time do he see the soul of a poor but very holy woman come in company of the angel to meet her husband soul at his decease and this he make know to one of his monk name a saxon by birth how s. know by revelation of the death of s.

Brendanus see a fiery pillar ascend fro s. head as he say mass how for three entire day he enjoy heavenly vision and of other miracle in this kind chap. 4 four holy founder of monastery who name be Congellus Cahinnechus Brendanus and Cormacus come out of Ireland to visit the saint find he in the i will Himba these holy man with one accord do choose that s. shall confecrate the holy mystery of the eucharist in their presence who yield to their pious desire enter the church at once with they and while the mass be celebrate s.
