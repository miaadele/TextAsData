to the right honourable his very good lord the earl of Devonshire lord lieutenant of Ireland it may please your good lordship I can be ignorant and aught to be sensible of the wrong which I sustain in common speech as if I have be false or unthankful to that noble but unfortunate earl the earl of Essex and for satisfy the vulgar sort I do not so much regard it though I love good name but yet as a handmaid and attendant of honesty and virtue for I be of his opinion that say pleasant that it be a shame to he that be a suitor to the mistress to make love to the wait woman and therefore to woo or court common fame otherwise then it follow upon honest course I for my part find not myself fit nor dispose but on the other side there be no worldly thing that concern myself which I hold more dear than the good opinion of certain person among which there be none I will more willing give satisfaction unto then to your lordship first because you love my lord of Essex and therefore will not be partial towards i which be part of that I desire next because it have ever please you to show yourself to i a honourable friend and so no baseness in i to seek to satisfy you and last because I know your lordship be excellent ground in the true rule and habit of duty and morality which must be they which shall decide this matter wherein my lord my defence need to be but simple and brief namely that whatsoever I do concern that action and proceed be do in my duty and service to the queen and the state in which I will not show myself false heart nor faint heart for any man sake live for every honest man that have his heart well plant will forsake his king rather than forsake God and forsake his friend rather than forsake his king and yet will forsake any earthly commodity yea and his own life in some case rather than forsake his friend I hope the world have not forget these degree else the heathen say shall judge they and if any man shall say that I do officious intrude myself into that business because I have no ordinary place the like may be say of all the business in effect that pass the hand of the learned counsel either of state or revenue these many year wherein I be continual use for as your lordship may remember the queen know her strength so well as she look her word shall be a warrant and after the manner of the choice prince before she do not always tie she trust to place but do sometime divide private favour from office and I for my part though I be not so unseen in the world but I know the condition be subject to envy and peril yet because I know again she be constant in her favour and make a end where she begin and special because she uphold i with extraordinary access and other demonstration of confidence and grace I resolve to endure it in expectation of better but my scope and desire be that your lordship will be please to have the honourable patience to know the truth in some particularity of all that pass in this cause wherein I have any part that you may perceive how honest a heart I ever bare to my sovereign and to my country and to that noble man who have so well deserve of i and so well accept of my deserve who fortune I can remember without much grief but for any action of i towards he there be nothing that pass i in my life time that come to my remembrance with more clearness and less check of conscience for it will appear to your lordship that I be not only not opposite to my lord of Essex but that I do occupy the utmost of my wit and adventure my fortune with the queen to have reintegrate he and so continue faithful and industrious till his last fatal impatience for so I will call it after which day there be not time to work for he though the same my affection when it can not work upon the subject proper go to the next with no ill effect towards some other who I think do rather not know it than not acknowledge it and this I will assure your lordship I will leave nothing untell that be truth for any enemy that I have to add and on the other side I must reserve much which make for i upon many respect of duty which I esteem above my credit and what I have here set down to your lordship I protest as I hope to have any part in God favour be true it be well know how I do many year since dedicate my travel and study to the use and as I may term it service of my lord of Essex which I protest before God I do not make election of he as the likely mean of my own advancement but out of the humour of a man that ever from the time I have any use of reason whether it be read upon good book or upon the example of a good father or by nature I love my country more than be answerable to my fortune and I hold at that time my lord to be the fit instrument to do good to the state and therefore I apply myself to he in a manner which I think happen rare among man for I do not only labour careful and industrious in that he set i about whether it be matter of advice or otherwise but neglect the queen service i own fortune and in a sort my vocation I do nothing but device and ruminate with myself to the best of my understanding proposition and memorial of any thing that may concern his lordship honour fortune or service and when not long after I enter into this course my brother master Anthony Bacon come from beyond the sea be a gentleman who ability the world take knowledge of for matter of state special foreign I do likewise knit his service to be at my lord dispose and on the other side I must and will ever acknowledge my lord love trust and favour towards i last of all his liberality have enfeoff i of land which I sell for eighteen hundred pound to master Reynold Nicholas and I think be more worth and that at such a time and with so kind and noble circumstance as the manner be as much as the matter which though it be but a idle digression yet because I be not willing to be short in commemoration of his benefit I will presume to trouble your lordship with the relate to you the manner of it after the queen have deny i the solicitor place for the which his lordship have be a long and earnest suitor on my behalf it please he to come to i from Richmond to Twicknam park and break with i and say master Bacon the queen have deny i yond place for you and have place another I know you be the least part of your own matter but you fare ill because you have choose i for your mean and dependence you have spend your time and thought in my matter I die these be his very word if I do not somewhat towards your fortune you shall not deny to accept a piece of land which I will bestow upon you my answer I remember be that for my fortune it be no great matter but that his lordship offer make i call to mind what be wont to be say when I be in France of the duke of Guise that he be the great usurer in France because he have turn all his estate into obligation mean that he have leave himself nothing but only have bind number of person to he now my lord say I I will not have you imitate his course nor turn your state thus by great gift into obligation for you will find many bad debtor he bid i take no care for that and press it whereupon I say my lord I see I must be your homager and hold land of your gift but do you know the manner of do homage in law always it be with a save of his faith to the king and his other lord and therefore my lord say I I can be no more you than I be and it must be with the ancient save and if I grow to be a rich man you will give i leave to give it back to some of your unrewarded follower but to return sure I be though I can arrogate nothing to myself but that I be a faithful remembrancer to his lordship that while I have most credit with he his fortune go on best and yet in two main point we always direct and contradictory differ which I will mention to your lordship because it give light to all that follow the one be I ever set this down that the only course to be hold with the queen be by obsequiousness and observance and I remember I will usual gage confident that if he will take that course constant and with choice of good particular to express it the queen will be bring in time to Assuerus question to ask what shall be do to the man that the king will honour meaning that her goodness be without limit where there be a true concurrence which I know in her nature to be true my lord on the other side have a settle opinion that the queen can be bring to nothing but by a kind of necessity and authority and I well remember when by violent course at any time he have get his will he will ask i now sir who principle be true and I will again say to he my lord these course be like to hot water they will help at a pang but if you use they you shall spoil the stomach and you shall be fain still to make they strong and strong and yet in the end they will less their operation with much other variety wherewith I use to touch that string another point be tahat I always vehement dissuade he from seek greatness by a military dependence or by a popular dependence as that which will breed in the queen jealousy in himself presumption and in the state perturbation and I do usual compare they to Icarus two wing which be join on with wax and will make he venture to soar too high and then fail he at the height and I will further say unto he my lord stand upon two foot and fly not upon two wing the two foot be the two kind of justice commutative and distributive use your greatness for advance of merit and virtue and relieve wrong and burden you shall need no other art or fineness but he will tell i that opinion come not from my mind but from my robe but it be very true that I that never mean to enthral myself to my lord of Essex nor any other man more than stand with the public good do though I can little prevail divert he by all mean possible from course of the war and popularity for I see plain the queen must either live or die if she live than the time will be as in the declination of a old prince if she die the time will be as in the begin of a new and that if his lordship do rise too fast in these course the time may be dangerous for he and he for they nay I remember I be thus plain with he upon his voyage to the land when I see every spring put forth such action of charge and provocation that I say to he my lord when I come first unto you I take you for a physician that desire to cure the disease of the state but now I doubt you will be like those physician which can be content to keep their patient low because they will always be in request which plaineresse he nevertheless take very well as he have a excellent care and be and assure i the case of the realm require it and I think this speech of i and the like renew afterward prick he to write that apology which be in many man hand but this difference in two point so main and material breed in process of time a discontinuance of privateness as it be the manner of man seldom to communicate where they think their course not approve between his lordship and myself so as I be not call nor advise with for some year and a half before his lordship go into Ireland as in former time yet nevertheless touch his go into Ireland it please he express and in a set manner to desire my opinion and counsel at which time I do not only dissuade but protest against his go tell he with as much vehemency and asseveration as I can that absence in that kind will exulcerate the queen mind whereby it will not be possible for he to carry himself so as to give her sufficient contentment nor for she to carry herself so as to give he sufficient countenance which will be ill for she ill for he and ill for the State and because I will omit no argument I remember I stand also upon the difficulty of the action set before he out of history that the irish be such a enemy as the ancient gaul or briton or german be and that we see how the roman who have such discipline to govern their soldier and such donative to encourage they and the whole world in a manner to levy they yet when they come to deal with enemy which place their felicity only in liberty and the sharpness of their sword and have the natural and elemental advantage of wood and bog and hardness of body they ever find they have their hand full of they and therefore conclude that go over with such expectation as he do and through the curlishnesse of the enterprise not like to answer it will mighty diminish his reputation and many other reason I use so as I be sure I never in any thing in my life time deal with he in like earnestness by speech by write and by all the mean I can devise for I do as plain see his overthrow chain as it be by destiny to that journey as it be possible for any man to ground a judgement upon future contingent but my lord howsoever his ear be open yet his heart and resolution be shut against that advice whereby his ruin may have be prevent after my lord go I see how true a prophet I be in regard of the evident alteration which natural succeed in the queen mind and thereupon I be still in watch to find the best occasion that in the weakness of my power I can either take or minister to pull he out of the fire if it have be possible and not long after i think I see some overture thereof which I apprehend ready a particularity I think be know to very few and the which I do the rather relate to your lordship because I hear it shall be talk that while my lord be in Ireland I reveal some matter against he or I can tell what which if it be not a mere slander as the rest be but have any though never so little colour be sure upon this occasion the queen one day at nonesuch a little as I remember before cuff come over I attend she show a passionate distaste of my lord proceed in Ireland as if they be unfortunate without judgement contemptuous and not without some private end of his own and all that may be and be please as she speak of it to many that she trust least so to fall into the like speech with i whereupon I who be still awake and true to my ground which I think sure for my lord good say to this effect madam I know not the particular of estate and I know this that prince action must have no abrupt period or conclusion but otherwise I will think that if you have my lord of Essex here with a white staff in his hand as my lord of Leicester have and continue he still about you for society to yourself and for a honour and ornament to your attendance and court in the eye of your people and in the eye of foreign ambassador than be he in his right element for to discontent he as you do and yet to put arm and power into his hand may be a kind of temptation to make he prove cumbersome and unruly and therefore if you will and send for he and satisfy he with honour here near you if your affair which as I have say I be not acquaint with will permit it I think be the best way which course your lordship know if it have be take than all have be well and no contempt in my lord come over nor continuance of these jealousy which that employment of Ireland breed and my lord here in his former greatness well the next news that I hear be that my lord be come over and that he be commit to his chamber for leave Ireland without the queen licence this be at nonesuch where as my duty be I come to his lordship and talk with he private about a quarter of a hour and he ask my opinion of the course be take with he I tell he my lord it be but a mist but shall I tell your lordship it be as mist be if it go upward it may hap cause a shower if downward it will clear up and therefore good my lord carry it so as you take away by all mean all ombrage and distaste from the queen and special if I be worthy to advise you as I have be by yourself think and now your question import the continuance of that opinion observe three point first make not this cessation or peace which be conclude with Tyrone as a service wherein you glory but as a shuffle up of a prosecution which be not very fortunate next represent not to the queen any necessity of estate whereby as by a coercion or wrench she shall think herself enforce to send you back into Ireland but leave it to she three seek access serious sport every way I remember my lord be willing to hear i but speak very few word and shake his head sometime as if he think I be in the wrong but sure I be he do just contrary in every one of these three point after this during the while since my lord be commit to my lord keeper I come diverse time to the queen as I have use to do about cause of her revenue and law business as be well know by reason of which access according to the ordinary charity of court it be give out that I be one of they that incense the queen against my lord of Essex these speech I can tell nor I will not think that they grow any way from her majesty own speech who memory I will ever honour if they do she be with God and but I must give this testimony to my lord Cecil that one time in his house at the Savoy he deal with i direct and say to i cousin I hear it but I believe it not that you shall do some ill office to my lord of Essex for my part I be mere passive and not active in this action and I follow the queen and that heavy and I leave she not my lord of Essex be one that in nature I can consent with as well as with any one live the queen indeed be my sovereign and I be her creature I may not lose she and the same course I will wish you to take whereupon I satisfy he how far I be from any such mind and as sometime it come to pass that man inclination be open more in a toy then in a serious matter a little before that time be about the middle of Michaelmas term her majesty have a purpose to dine at my lodge at Twicknan park at which time I have though I profess not to be a poet prepare a sonnet direct tend and allude to draw on her majesty reconcilement to my lord which I remember also I show to a great person and one of my lord near friend who commend it this though it be as I say but a toy yet it show plain in what spirit I proceed and that I be ready not only to do my lord good office but to publish and declare myself for he and never be I so ambitious of any thing in my life time as I be to have carry some token or favour from her majesty to my lord use all the be I have both to procure her majesty to send and myself to be the messenger for as to the former I fear not to allege to she that this proceed towards my lord be a thing towards the people very implausible and therefore wish her majesty howsoever she do yet to discharge herself of it and to lay it upon other and therefore that she shall intermix her proceed with some immediate grace from herself that the world may take knowledge of her princely nature and goodness lest it shall alienate the heart of her people from she which I do stand upon know very well that if she once relent to send or visit those demonstration will prove matter of substance for my lord good and to draw that employment upon myself I advise her majesty that whensoever God shall move she to turn the light of her favour towards my lord to make signification to he thereof that her majesty if she do it not in person will at the least use some such mean as may not entitle themselves to any part of the thanks as person that be think mighty with she to work she or to bring she about but to use some such as can not be think but a mere conduct of she own goodness but I can never prevail with she though I be persuade she see plain whereat I level but she have i in jealousy that I be not she entire but still have inward and deep respect towards my lord more than stand at that time with her will and pleasure about the same time I remember a answer of i in a matter which have some affinity with my lord cause which though it grow from i go after about in other name for her majesty be mighty incense with that book which be dedicate to my lord of Essex be a story of the first year of king Henry the four think it a seditious prelude to put into the people head boldness and faction say she have good opinion that there be treason in it and ask i if I can not find any place in it that may be draw within case of treason whereto I answer for treason sure I find none but for felony very many and when her majesty hasty ask i wherein I tell she the author have commit very apparent theft for he have take most of the sentence of Cornelius Tacitus and translate they into english and put they into his text and another time when the queen will not be persuade that it be his writing who name be to it but that it have some more mischievous author and say with great indignation that she will have he rack to produce his author I reply nay madam he be a doctor never rack his person but rack his style let he have pen ink and paper and help of book and be enjoin to continue the story where it break off and I will undertake by collect the style to judge whether he be the author or no. but for the main matter sure I be when the queen at any time ask my opinion of my lord case I ever in one tenor say unto she that they be fault which the law may term contempt because they be the transgression of her particular direction and instruction but than what defence may be make of they in regard of the great interest the person have in her majesty favour in regard of the greatness of his place and the ampleness of his commission in regard of the nature of the business be action of war which in common case can be tie to strictness of instruction in regard of the distance of the place have also a sea between that demand and command must be subject to wind and weather in regard of a counsel of state in Ireland which he have at his back to avow his action upon and last in regard of a good intention that he will allege for himself which I tell she in some religion be hold to be a sufficient dispensation for God commandment much more for prince in all these regard I beseech her majesty to be advise again and again how she bring the cause into any public question nay I go further for I tell she my lord be a eloquent and well speak man and beside his eloquence of nature or art he have a eloquence of accident which pass they both which be the pity and benevolence of his hearer and therefore that when he shall come to his answer for himself I doubt his word will have so unequal passage above they that shall charge he as will not be for her majesty honour and therefore wish the conclusion may be that they may wrap it up private between themselves and that she will restore my lord to his former attendance with some addition of honour to take away discontent but this I will never deny that I do show no approbation general of his be send back again into Ireland both because it will have carry a repugnancy with my former discourse and because I be in my own heart full persuade that it be not good neither for the queen nor for the state nor for himself and yet I do not dissuade it neither but leave it ever as for this particularity I do well remember that after your lordship be name for the place in Ireland and not long before your go it please her majesty at white hall to speak to i of that nomination at which time I say to she sure madam if you mean not to employ my lord of Essex thither again your majesty can make a better choice and be go on to show some reason and her majesty interrupt i with great passion Essex say she whensoever I send Essex back again into Ireland I will marry you claim it of i whereunto I say well madam I will release that contract if his go be for the good of your State immediate after the queen have think of a course which be also execute to have somewhat publish in the star-chamber for the satisfaction of the world touch my lord of Essex his restraint and my lord of Essex not to be call to it but occasion to be take by reason of some libel then disperse which when her majesty propound unto i I be utter against it and tell she plain that the people will say that my lord be wound upon his back and that justice have her balance take from she which ever consist of a accusation and defence with many other quick and significant term to that purpose in so much that I remember I say that my lord be too hard for she and therefore wish she as I have do before to wrap it up private and certain I offend she at that time which be rare with i for I call to mind that both the Christmas Lent and Easter term follow though I come diverse time to she upon law business yet i think her face and manner be not so clear and open to i as it be at the first and she do direct charge i that I be absent that day at the star-chamber which be very true but I allege some indisposition of body to excuse it and during all the time aforesaid there be from she to i touch my lord of Essex cause but towards the end of Easter term her majesty break with i and tell i that she have find my word true for that the proceed in the star-chamber have do no good but rather kindle factious bruit as she term they then quench they and therefore that she be determine now for the satisfaction of the world to proceed against my lord in the star-chamber by a information and to have my lord bring to his answer howbeit she say she will assure i that whatsoever the do shall be towards my lord as indeed she have often repeat the same phrase before whereunto I say to the end utter to divert she madam if you will have i speak to you in this argument I must speak to you as friar Bacon head speak that say first time be and then time be and time will never be for certain say I it be now far too late the matter be cold and have take too much wind whereat she seem again offend and rise from i and that resolution for a while continue and after in the begin of midsummer term I attend she and find she settle in that resolution which I hear of also otherwise she fall upon the like speech it be true that see no other remedy I say to she slight why madam if you will needs have a proceed you be best have it in some such sort as Ovid speak of his mistress to make a counseltable matter of it and there a end which speech again she seem to take in ill part but yet I think it do good at that time and help to divert that course of proceed by information in the star-chamber nevertheless afterward it please she to make a more solemn matter of the proceed and some few day after when order be give that the matter shall be hear at York house before a assembly of counsellor peer and judge and some audience of man of quality to be admit and then do some principal counsellor send for we of the learned counsel and notify her majesty pleasure unto we save that it be say to i open by one of they that her majesty be not yet resolve whether she will have i forbear in the business or no. and hereupon may arise that other sinister and untrue speech that I hear be raise of i how I be a suitor to be use against my lord of Essex at that time for it be very true that I that know well what have pass between the queen and i and what occasion I have give she both of distaste and distrust in cross her disposition by stand steadfast for my lord of Essex and suspect it also to be a stratagem arise from some particular emulation I write to her two or three word of complement signify to her majesty that if she will be please to spare i in my lord of Essex cause out of the consideration she take of my obligation towards he I shall reckon it for one of her high favour but otherwise desire her majesty to think that I know the degree of duty and that no particular obligation whatsoever to any subject can supplant or weaken that entireness of duty that I do owe and bear to she and her service and this be the goodly suit I make be a respect no man that have his wit can have omit but nevertheless I have a further reach in it for I judge that day work will be a full period of any bitterness or harshness between the queen and my lord and therefore if I declare myself full according to her mind at that time which can not do my lord any manner of prejudice I shall keep my credit with she ever after whereby to do my lord service hereupon the next news that I hear be that we be all send for again and that her majesty pleasure be we all shall have part in the business and the lord fall into distribution of our part it be allot to i that I shall set forth some undutiful carriage of my lord in give occasion and countenance to a seditious pamphlet as it be term which be dedicate unto he which be the book before mention of king Henry the four whereupon I reply to that allotment and say to their lordship that it be a old matter and have no manner of coherence with the rest of the charge be matter of Ireland and therefore that I have be wrong by bruit before this will expose i to they more and it will be say I give in evidence my own tale it be answer again with good show that because it be consider how I stand tie to my lord of Essex therefore that part be think fit for i which do he least hurt for that whereas all the rest be matter of charge and accusation this only be but matter of caveat and admonition wherewith though I be in my own mind little satisfy because I know well a man be better to be charge with some fault then admonish of some other yet the conclusion bind upon the queen pleasure direct I can not avoid that part that be lay upon i which part if in the delivery I do handle not tender though no man before i do in so clear term free my lord from all disloyalty as I do that your lordship know must be ascribe to the superior duty I do owe to the queen fame and and honour in a public proceed and partly to the intention I have to uphold myself in credit and strength with the queen the better to be able to do my lord good office afterward for assoon as this day be past I lose no time but the very next day follow as I remember I attend her majesty full resolve to try and put in ure my utmost endeavour so far as I in my weakness can give furtherance to bring my lord again speedy into court and into favour and know as I suppose at least how the queen be to be use I think that to make she conceive that the matter go well then be the way to make she leave off there and I remember well I say to she you have now madam obtain victory over two thing which the great prince in the world can at their will subdue the one be over fame the other be over a great mind for sure the world be now I hope reasonable well satisfy and for my lord he do show that humiliation towards your majesty as I be persuade he be never in his life time more fit for your favour than he be now therefore if your majesty will not mar it by linger but give over at the best and now you have make so good a full point receive he again with tenderness I shall then think that all that be pass be for the best whereat I remember she take exceed great contentment and do often iterate and put i in mind that she have ever say that her proceed shall be and not as who say that now be the time I shall well perceive that that say of she shall prove true and further she will i to set down in write all that pass that day I obey her commandment and within some few day bring she again the narration which I do read unto she at two several afternoon and when I come to that part that set forth my lord own answer which be my principal care I do well bear in mind that she be extraordinary move with it in kindness and relent towards my lord and tell i afterward speak how well I have express my lord part that she perceive old love will not easy be forget whereto I answer sudden that I hope she mean that by herself but in conclusion I do advise she that now she have take a representation of the matter to herself that she will let it go no further for madam say I the fire blaze well already what shall you tumble it and beside it may please you keep a convenience with yourself in this case for since your express direction be there shall be no register nor clerk to take this sentence nor no record or memorial make up of the proceed why shall you now do that popular which you will not admit to be do judicial whereupon she do agree that that writing shall be suppress and I think there be not five person that ever see it but from this time forth during the whole latter end of that summer while the court be at Nonsuch and Otlands I make it my task and scope to take and give occasion for my lord reintegration in his fortune which my intention I do also signify to my lord assoon as ever he be at his liberty whereby I may without peril of the queen indignation write to he and have receive from his lordship a courteous and love acceptation of my good will and endeavour I do apply it in all my access to the queen which be very many at that time and purposely seek and wrought upon other variable pretence but only and chief for that purpose and on the other side I do not forbear to give my lord from time to time faithful advertisement what I find and what I wish and I draw for he by his appointment some letter to her majesty which though I know well his lordship gift and style be far better than i own yet because he require it allege that by his long restraint he be grow almost a stranger to the queen present conceit I be ready to perform it and sure I be that for the space of six week or two month it prosper so well as I expect continual his restore to his attendance and I be never better welcome to the queen nor more make of then when I speak full and bold for he in which kind the particular be exceed many whereof for a example I will remember to your lordship one or two as at one time I call to mind her majesty be speak of a fellow that undertake to cure or at least to ease my brother of his gout and ask i how it go forward and I tell her majesty that at the first he receive good by it but after in the course of his cure he find himself it a stay or rather worse the queen say again I will tell you Bacon the error of it the manner of these physician and especial these empiric be to continue one kind of medicine which at the first be proper be to draw out the ill humour but after they have not the discretion to change their medicine but apply still draw medicine when they shall rather intend to cure and corroborate the part good lord madam say I how wise and apt can you speak and discern of physic minister to the body and consider not that there be the like occasion of physic minister to the mind as now in the case of my lord of Essex your princely word ever be that you intend ever to reform his mind and not ruin his fortune I know well you can but think that you have draw the humour sufficient and therefore it be more than time and it be but for doubt of mortify or exulcerate that you do apply and minister strength and comfort unto he for these same gradation of you be fit to corrupt then correct any mind of greatness and a other time I remember she tell i for news that my lord have write unto her some very dutiful letter and that she have be move by they and when she take it to be the abundance of the heart she find it to be but a preparative to a suit for the renew of his farm of sweet wine whereunto I reply o madam how do your majesty construe of these thing as if these two can not stand well together which indeed nature have plant in all creature for there be but two sympathy the one towards perfection the other towards preservation that to perfection as the iron contend to the loadstone that to preservation as the vine will creep towards a stake or prop that stand by it not for any love to the stake but to uphold itself and therefore madam you must distinguish my lord desire to do you service be as to his perfection that which he think himself to be bear for whereas his desire to obtain this thing of you be but for a sustentation and not to trouble your lordship with many other particular like unto these it be at the self same time that I do draw with my lord privity and by his appointment two letter the one write as from my brother the other as a answer return from my lord both to be by i in secret manner show to the queen which it please my lord very strange to mention at the bar the scope of which be but to represent and picture forth unto her majesty my lord mind to be such as I know her majesty will fain have have it which letter whosoever shall see for they can now be retract or alter be by reason of my brother or his lordship servant delivery long since come into diverse hand let he judge special if he know the queen and do remember those time whether they be not the labour of one that seek to bring the queen about for my lord of Essex his good the troth be that the issue of all his deal grow to this that the queen by some slackness of my lord as I imagine like he worse and worse and grow more incense towards he then she remember belike the continual and incessant and confident speech and course that I have hold on my lord side become utter alienate from i and for the space of at least three month which be between Michaelmas and Newyears tide follow will not as much as look on i but turn away from i with express and purpose-like discountenance wheresoever she see i and at such time as I desire to speak with she about law business ever send i forth very slight refusal insomuch as it be most true that immediate after newyear tide I desire to speak with she and be admit to she I deal with she plain and say madam I see you withdraw your favour from i and now I have lose many friend for your sake I shall lose you too you have put i like one of those that the frenchman call that serve on foot before horseman so have you put i into matter of envy without place or without strength and I know at chess a pawn before the king be ever much play upon a great many love i not because they think I have be against my lord of Essex and you love i not because you know I have be for he yet will I never repent i that I have deal in simplicity of heart towards you both without respect of caution to myself and therefore if I do break my neck I shall do it in manner as master dorrington do it which walk on the battlement of the church many day and take a view and survey where he shall fall and so madam say I I be not so simple but that I take a prospect of my overthrow only I think I will tell you so much that you may know that it be faith and not folly that bring i into it and so I will pray for you upon which speech of i utter with some passion it be true her majesty be exceed move and accumulate a number of kind and gracious word upon i and will i to rest upon this and a number of other sensible and tender word and demonstration such as more can not be but as touch my lord of whereupon I depart rest then determine to meddle no more in the matter as that that I see will overthrow i and not be able to do he any good and thus I make i own peace with my own confidence it that time and this be the last time I see her majesty before the eight of February which be the day of my lord of Essex his misfortune after which time for that I perform at the bar in my public service your lordship know by the rule of duty that I be to do it honest and without prevarication but for any put myself into it I protest before God I never move neither the queen nor any person live concern my be use in the service either of evidence or examination but it be mere lay upon i with the rest of my fellow and for the time which pass I mean between the arraignment and my lord suffer I well remember I be but once with the queen at what time though I dare not deal direct for my lord as thing than stand yet general I do both commend her majesty mercy term it to she as a excellent balm that do continual distill from her sovereign hand and make a excellent odour in the sense of her people and not only so but I take hardiness to extenuate not the fact for that I dare not but the danger tell she that if some base or cruel mind person have enter into such a action it may have cause much blood and combustion but it appear well they be such as know not how to play the malefactor and some other word which I now omit and as for the rest of the carriage of myself in that service I have many honourable witness that can tell that the next day after my lord arraignment by my diligence and information touch the quality and nature of the offender six of nine be stay which otherwise have be attaint I bring their lordship letter for their stay after the jury be swear to pass upon they so near it go and how careful I be and make it my part that whosoever be in trouble about that matter assoon as ever his case be sufficient know and define of may not continue in restraint but be set at liberty and many other part which I be well assure of stand with the duty of a honest man but indeed I will not deny for the case of sir Thomas smith of London the queen demand my opinion of it I tell she I think it be as hard as many of the rest but what be the reason because at that time I have see only his accusation and have never be present at any examination of he and the matter so stand I have be very untrue to my service if I have not deliver that opinion but afterward upon a reexamination of some that charge he who weaken their own testimony and especial hear himself I go instant to the queen out of the soundness of my conscience and not regard what opinion I have former deliver tell her majesty I be satisfy and resolve in my conscience that for the reputation of the action the plot be to countenance the action further by he in respect of his place than they have indeed any interest or intelligence with he it be very true also about that time her majesty take a like of my pen upon that which I have do before concern the proceed at York house and likewise upon some other declaration which in former time by her appointment I put in writing command i to pen that book which be publish for the better satisfaction of the world which I do but so as never secretary have more particular and express direction and instruction in every point how to guide my hand in it and not only so but after that I have make a first draught thereof and propound it to certain principal councillor by her majesty appointment it be peruse weigh censure alter and make almost anew write according to their lordship better consideration wherein their lordship and myself both be as religious and curious of truth as desirous of satisfaction and myself indeed give only word and form of style in pursue their direction and after it have pass their allowance it be again exact peruse by the queen herself and some alteration make again by her appointment nay and after it be set to print the queen who as your lordship know as she be excellent in great matter so she be exquisite in small and note that I can not forget my ancient respect to my lord of Essex in term he ever my lord of Essex my lord of Essex in almost every page of the book which she think not fit but will have it make Essex or the late earl of Essex whereupon of force it be print the none and the first copy suppress by her peremptory commandment and this my good lord to my further remembrance be all that pass wherein I have part which I have set down as near as I can in the very word and speech that be use not because they be worthy the repetition I mean those of my own but to the end your lordship may lively and plain discern between the face of truth and a smooth tale and the rather also because in thing that pass a good while since the very word and phrase do sometime bring to my remembrance the matter wherein I report i to your honourable judgement whether you do not see the trace of a honest man and have I be as well believe either by the queen or by my lord as I be well hear by they both both my lord have be fortunate and so have myself in his fortune to conclude therefore I humble pray your lordship to pardon i for trouble you with this long narration and that you will vouchsafe to hold i in your good opinion till you know I have deserve or find that I shall deserve the contrary and even so I continue at your lordship honourable commandment very humble
