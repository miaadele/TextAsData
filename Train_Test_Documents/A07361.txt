1 my muse be mount and perforce will write put i on to write some new find thing but I can from a shallow brain indite any that be new but must old tiding bring yet still my muse she do i much reprove and bid i cease unless I write of love 1 nothing in this age be so delightful as love-toy and lascivious rhyme wherein youth take his chief felicity for Venus the great goddess of love with her three child base beget as pride beauty and riches with her near kinsman the great god Bacchus at her elbow bear all the sway in these day so that one sheet of paper be more value write as a love-toy than a ream of paper write in this nature 2 and tell i that Bellona banish clear and hide her face even as a coward base and dare not once the goddess love come near for love not war be hold all in grace but yet I can but of war must speak and not of love although my heart shall break 2 yet can I wish the wise to consider that as Venus have she three delightful daughter and a frolic kinsman so have the goddess Bellona three handmaid fire sword and famine which be send abroad make such havoc of Venus image as nothing then be so much in respect as Mars his messenger which indeed be poor soldier which in this age be most of all man reject and disrespect unless it be of some noble spirit and the learned patron of divine contemptation and manager of martial affair 3 nor can I write as satirist use to do against what not some harsh invective verse nor strive I can to put my muse unto the pleasure of fair Venus to rehearse nor can I write as fit be indeed of bloody Mars oft make my body bleed 4 then muse give leave for I be mind now to warble out the whole catastrophey of the disaster I have wander through they be intricate as be Menander way a labyrinth wherein I have labour sore and yet my labour still be more and more 4 I call this my catastrophe for that it be the rehearsal of all or most what of my life passage since I be able to bear arm as a soldier be a tragical discourse of a soldier a traveller a prisoner a pilgrim a beggar and in some small measure a poor scholar 5 my labour have be for to travel much to search the secret on this orb of earth but yet alas my sorrow they be such in Lethe ditoh that I have lose my breath for nothing find I but the roll stone that have no moss nor none will grow upon 5 this ditch or flood of Lethe be the ditch or flood of all forgetfulness which make i forget my sorrow so quick the stone of Sisyphus be always turn yet never get any thing unless it be filth but be still bare and bare and so be i 6 a scholar once I do desire to be in learning lore I take a great delight but ere the virtue therein I can see the state to i bear such a deadly spite before my portion I can half possess they take it from i leave i motherless 6 my mother die ere I come to any perfection in learning which be my undo 7 then be young and fresh in youthful year my mind so green with every wave be toss which to repent I do with many tear to see how fond I my time then lose and eke how vain I my time do spend and never think how want will come in the end 7 I think of no want when I go first to the war which now make i come home by weep cross more be my sorrow 8 for nothing then will relish with my taste but what be get in great Bellona war instead of pen with pike my time I waste still search out where Mars do keep his jar till mean and friend and hope and all be go then old and maim I return home 8 he that put the hazard of his fortune be young to the hope of friend comfort be old be more like to die a beggar in contempt then at his death to give a dole to the poor to gain he commendation 9 where that I hope I shall just find true recompense for loss of mean and blood since for my nation I have be so kind to venture life and limb for country good but I instead of love and courtesy receive loss pain grief and misery 9 here I end my exordium 10 but to begin my catalogue of woe and of the sorrow I have undergo and of my service do against my foe of all the passage you shall hear anon though simple do pardon my want of skill it be the truth accept it for good will 10 and begin my catalogue 11 it be no poem nor no pamphlet rude the one I can learning I do want and into pamphlet I dare never intrude nor thrust myself because my brain be to scant to flourish up as poet can do well such dainty phrase I can never tell 11 I be no poet nor be I a pamphlet-maker I want learning for the one and cunning practice and curious phrase for the other 12 yet rural like the truth I will set forth poor as it be make by as poor a man and may be hold of as little worth because a soldier seem time to scan into a verse to show the spite of fate which he have buy at too too dear a rate 12 though it be not a work of Pean I be sure it be not of pan for he be a rich shepherd and I be a poor soldier and this be i own work true though never so homely 13 for first of all a friend that be i near entreat i who I can not deny in Ireland in arm for to appear in complete course my loyalty to try in the behalf of that same noble queen who like I think on earth be never see 13 the first service that ever I be in be in Ireland at a place call the curlewe be then the great oneile his country where be one of the worst day that the english have in Ireland for there be lose sir Coniers Clifford then colonel a noble commander sir Alexander radcliffe lieutenant colonel and brave sir james Harrington all of high birth and very noble with a world of english more to the great grief of the queen there I stay still and serve in diverse part after as at Dungannon where be good service at the isle of muck wherein go on be drown sir Samuel bagnall his ancient which make many prognosticate worse success than fall out also at kinsale where be a lamentable sore leaguer and a long but a happy for we in the end 14 for when my hope in learning it be lose I then take arm as hold it the best since fortune have my towardness so cross I think I can not be no better blessed then for my queen and honour country fight for to maintain their true and lawful right 15 though I but one yet one must needs begin a number that be number numberless then a soldier needy must come in to make the number be it more or less for why I play a soldier faithful part I do my best both with my hand and heart 16 but after that a hard time I have be a soldier there my queen be dead and go I get reward a shot may yet be see and that be all and then away do come home into England to my friend again who do disdain my service love and pain 16 at the queen death I come into England with a sore shot not whole yet as welcome to my friend as the poor mariner make water into his ship especial my stepmother 17 and bid i go once more another voyage and see if that I can find any worse for my own father dear swear in his rage the day that I be bear that he will curse and rather wish i in untimely grave then I one hour a future life shall have 18 when I poor soul have do nothing at all but what be just and honourable both and for defend the state general the best I can my mind be very loath to do that thing may not i well beseem in the defence of country and my queen 19 which when I see my friend obdurity and that my entertainment it be such and see nothing but present misery and that for love my friend hate i so much a wish that ere I may here live in scorn that I may die where I be never bear 20 then do I crave a soldier press to be which be well like by the better sort and do commend my love and duty free and to this day I have their good report that I will go unto the war again to venture life ere live with friend disdain 20 after this new supply go for Ireland I be press to go again not much unwilling see the refractory and harsh deal of my dear friend for as the old say be in prosperity a friend be easy find but in adversity not one of a thousand so have it be with i for ever when I come into England with a full purse the dear and near friend I have will help i to spend it and make it empty but when I come home poor I be not for their company 21 which I do do and then do much endure a second time in Ireland again and further mean I never can procure save that I get my labour for my pain for when sir Cary Dougherthy be dead I come to England force to beg my bread 21 I serve in Ireland until the last rebellion in Loughfoyle begin at the diry by sir Cary Dougherthy in which time I serve under the command of sir Oliver saint John after lord deputy also sir Edward York sir richard Hansard captain George malary and sir George Flower 22 where that I find such simple courtesy as cause i again to leave the land and then I travail into Italy when noble payton do our force command under the signior and venetian state where I buy wit at such a extreme rate 22 after my second time come from Ireland I find such poor respect of my friend that I travel into Italy and serve under the english regiment at Venice sir Henry payton be general my captain be billingsley 23 as that I do beside my loss of blood endure the hard and cruel slavery even of the turk where I find nothing good but all I get be stripe and misery but God in mercy after a time be please ay from the turkish slavery be ease 23 but go a unfortunate voyage to sea for desire of gain I get instead a world of pain be take prisoner by the turk where I remain a slave a long time but by God providence beyond expectation of any human reason I be by the help of the christian release to wit a man of Florence who bring i to Leghorn a dainty haven town seat to the sea upon the foot of the river Arno which run up from thence to the rare and goodly city Florence but rather I may say the river Arno run from Florence to Leghorn be about fifty mile 24 and do return to Florence city fair where now again I come to Italy and be overjoy to see that city rare in my conceit the prime of Lombardie though many praise some other city more yet do I think they be mistake sore 24 the say be that Italy be the of the world and that Lombardy be the garden of Italy and Florence the garden of Lombardy which indeed it be for it be curious for building delicate seat and very brave people and full of plenty it have in it a very stately grand dome or church all of pure chequer work white and black marble corner wise set there be a great and massy ball of beat gold on the top of the high steeple 25 though Venice it be rich and Genoa proud Milan be learn and Belogna brave and mighty Rome for spaciousness abow Dainby Verona yet none of these you have so Dainby fair a curious seat to see as Florence be within all Italy 25 after I leave Florence I be at diverse curious city of marvellous beauty of which I have name some especial Genoa where the marquis Spinola have a curious house Genoa exceed for high build any place that ever I see Milan be a dainty academy especial for physic and so be Mantua Verona a very fine city as also Bellogna Brussia Bargamore and many other Rome i thought be but a ragged great thing and not very beautiful the chief thing of note be the bridge of Tiber and saint Angelo the pyramid the pope palace and his gild gate with the great and metropolitan church of saint Peter as also I must remember their Panthaon which be the temple of the old roman god which be a mighty thing build round either for fear their god shall fall by the ear for prerogative royal as indeed it be or else for fear they shall run out at the west end of the church like stout god and turn coward 26 but leave Italy thus after I have be from England almost twice five year I pass the alps those mighty mountain high where I do weep more drop of brinish tear then I get water for to drink that time save cold snow to slake the thirst be i 26 I come out of Italy over the alps in winter where I be not perish so much with cold but hungry also be sixteen day without a bit of bread come hanibal way when their be no convoy upon which I make the follow fiction 27 yet for my thirst it be not so extreme but that I can have undergo the same but for vild hunger I can find no mean it be so grievous and so much to blame that I be glad to satisfy his force by eat bark from tree and that be worse 28 for I be glad pass that desert way which Hannibal they say for his army make weary by night and travel by day where many a filthy root my taste assay before I come unto the Silvian wood where comfort none I find nor nothing good 29 betwixt these mountain and these desert wood i think I hear a hollow sound voice come from the crag whereas poor silly shrub do grow secure there do I hear this noise even as a echo sound forth to i his name his nature and his quality 30 which when I hear my sense be amaze betwixt hope and fear I stand as one half dead to hear a voice out from those rock so raise to cry to i and ask i for some bread when I poor man have nothing for to eat tear for my drink and sorrow for my meat 31 alas quoth I my sorrow be too much and thou be hunger I do know thou well I do not love companion to have such nay stay quoth he a tale I must thou tell how once in plenty thou do make no spare now have thou hunger nought else for thy share a speech make by the great king Hunger 32 be not I hunger and of force will be the great commander of each monarchy when pride do come with riches in his hand think my power he can perforce withstand what be my plot to bring he down to bow and beck to i o I shall tell thou how envy I send and sweet ambition both to pride and riches which be very loath to part with either until they have bring both pride and riches and themselves to nought by mortal war or by such vain desire as envy pride ambition still require then do I laugh to see their bravery bring down so low as subject be to i and be subject bring unto my thrall their life be hateful death be best of all for though a mean in all extreme there be yet their no mean nor mercy find in i for I be hunger and so extreme strong i will make the wife to do her husband wrong nay I be hunger and do prick so deep i will make the strong heart on earth to weep i will make the naked man run as he be mad to beg a crust and of the same be glad to feed i hunger poor king that I be and think himself more than a happy man nay I command a strong beleaguer citiy and of their sorrow I do take no pity when fire and sword and all the wrath of man can they conquer if I come I can nay I can make they with old Me^iana weep and force they search even in the dunghill to find a maggot if she be not their to eat their child and to make good cheer deep and tyranny even such as this I do yet thou vild pride that put i thereunto for if thou pride with riches will assent to give the poor poor nature poor content and keep thyself from foul ambitious hate and be content and gripe no more estate but help the poor and hurt he not at all and come not in base envy filthy thrall which ruin kingdom much more may do thou although thou live in great security and when I hunger knock and let thou see how that the poor be hunger-starved by i if thou will help they with thy poor crumb that from the dainty of thy table come what need I plead upon this woeful stage but that it be a more than iron-age for pity mercy and all love be flee but pride and envy never will be dead until I cease upon their body brave then do I bring envy and pride to grave be not I king the strong then on earth save only he which give all vital breath which be say this hang voice be go yet I be leave with hunger all alone the end of this fiction 33 now after nineteen day be quite over past those desert hill and wood I leave they all and unto Basil I do come at last and then with the Rhine towards Germany do fall and short come to strasburgh city brave where love entertainment that I have 33 the first town of note I come to on this side the alps be Basil be seat very high on the Rhine 34 for there I find a english gentleman one Middleton a corporal there be he who do not spare to do the best he can in any kind then for to comfort i for to a gesthouse he i present send where that I find good Christian like content 34 here at strasburgh I have kind entertainment by the mean of master Middleton I lay there in the gesthouse be a very dainty stove to be in reasonable good meat and wine with curious good lodging where I lay five day 35 here do I stay five day myself to ease and go to view the church fabric fair and there I see the eye of man to please the sun and moon and heaven by motion rare how each from other do pass and impart strange for to see all wrought by curious art 35 here in this church be this work of wonder for by motion you may see how the whole orb move also how the sun and moon pass the heaven as also the four age of man as infancy youth strength and old age as also the four quarter of the year as spring summer harvest and winter pass by motion with the four quarter of the hour and then when the clock strike the brazen cock crow and clap his wing 36 beside the crow of a brazen cock with dainty voice both audible and shrill once in a hour by motion as a clock and other wonder of exceed skill beside the steeple be call they say a wonder of the world as well it may 36 for this steeple it be build eight square exceed high all arch one upon another so that which way soever you pass you may see quite through it and for the curious workmanship to be in such a stone I think the like be not to be see 37 for though the church of Florence build be of checker-work and diamond wise to view also the steeple curious work to see grace with a ball of beat gold so true yet it be not like to strasburgh steeple fair nor for the building it be not half so rare 38 for that it be of such exceed height arch bind most dainty to spectator view arch upon arch by perfect art and sleight he that never see it scant will think it true that such a work within the world be wrought by mortal man since man be make of nought 39 here do I see bring in by burgher two a man they say be call the wander jew but I with he have nought at all to do so that for i he may be false or true for what he be as then I do not care my mind be more my supper not to spare 39 here I see this old pilgrim who master Middleton tell i be note to be the wander jew but for my part I do take no great regard of he more than I have write 40 a black tall man of stature that he be with visage stern his colour pale and wan and pilgrim he both up and down do pass within the town where I do see he than groan sigh and sob I hear he often give but what of he they say I scarce believe 41 this town environ with the noble Rhine govern by state within themselves all free and guard strong by soldier brave and fine stout man of body as a man shall see courteous and kind to stranger that they be this can I say for they be so to i 41 this town of strasburgh be a free state of itself environ by the river Rhine a very strong thing and a brave garrison of soldier in it well maintain when I be there they wear red velvet cassock with the flower deluce in blue cloth and edge with silver very comely 42 so now to saurine that I take my way and through a desert and a mighty wood unto panspoyce but there I can not stay for there I find not any thing be good but harbour cold and courtesy so much I do not care how seldom I have such 42 I come by many other place I can name also it be needless 43 then do I come to the duke of lorain land and to the dainty city of Nancie dainty it be and sweet it do stand for air most sweet and good commodity for corn and cattle wood and water fair it have enough and can to other spare 43 if this city of Nancie be not of late ruinate it be as fine a little sweet thing as ever a man can see on earth for all outward blessing natural for man content a little before I come to it I be at a great monastery where be many english jesuit and other priest call saint Nicholai 44 so now by tow and fow Tholas and bar I pass my way with cold and hunger both and though indeed I come my country war to help my need there be few or none that do unless poor man I get a bit of bread which few will give for to relieve my need 45 so on I come unto the champion plain where fourteen day I travail with woe for nothing have I all within the same but what the cloister help i then unto some meat and drink and harbour poor I have though it be poor yet of it I be glad 45 this champion country be a very scant country for fire but very rich of corn especial also there be pretty good store of hard wine to keep out the cold 46 for winter it be cold and I be poor my clothing thin and barefoot than I be and all my limb be numb and grow so sore that ten mile on a day I can not pass yet in the end I come to Paris city where I do find some comfort love and pity 46 I will speak nothing of these part of France be all in Picardy and Normandy which every one almost know they be so near hand 47 so then to Roan where merchant kind I find and then to deep a dainty haven town where I get ship for our english ground and come to Dover poor and eke unknown but yet I have the gesthouse courtesy John bangor then be in the majoralty 47 John bangor be major when I land at Dover 48 from he a pass to London that I have be both poor lame and in misery where when I come my heart indeed be glad for there I get good clothes even present for that some money fall unto my lot that former sorrow they be all for^ot 49 then news be come of the bohemian war for which my mind be present so bend that I will see how there will go the jar and do indeed for thither that I go with noble Grace and many worthy man who do not come again not one of ten 49 I go into Bohemia with sir Andrew Grace be general we be not there long before all be lose yet for the time there be some sharp do and much loss 50 for though indeed the service it be short because at first the hope be very poor yet pilsen it can tell there be brave sport when all the ground with blood be turn gore and Prague can say and other part indeed that in these war many a brave heart do bleed 51 thus when I see the hope be poor and bare no stay then at all there be for i for nothing see I fall unto my share but service hard with want and misery away I come to the palatinate and for my welcome there a shot I get 52 there be in service to defend the land of englishman so brave a regiment who noble Vere as general do command the like I never see where ere I go for of a hundred scarce you can find ten but by their birth or worth be gentleman 53 Oxford and Essex noble earl be there and many gallant under their command brave rich and Wentworth and Burlassie be with colour fly fair in field do stand that noble burrough and brave Herbert too fairfax and Wilmot all their best to do 53 never go a more noble company of voluntary soldier out of England then go to this voyage of the palatinate and have worse success 54 knowl and kind Thornix they be not behind with many gallant here to try their luck and many more who be of noble mind even as Bonithon and brave captain buck who come to look for honour in the field for to the foe that they will never yield 55 once here we have hope of a noble day and be prepare with the foe to fight when noble Oxford lead our vanguard way have the foe before we in our sight think none other but without all doubt to end that war by then to fight it out 55 this be the day that the palatinate be lose for if we have go on we have such vantage every way especial in horse as also our soldier very able and as forward to go upon service we have good store of canon and all mount our horse have give fire to the enemy we have all thing just in readiness for the battle then marquis baden be general of the field betray the country and will not let we fight that night so in the morning the enemy be flee and get his trench and so we lose all 56 our forlorn hope be ready all draw forth and doctor burgess give brave encouragement to all our soldier who be of that worth that all be ready and to battle bend but marquis baden all our hope then bar and all our pastime for that day be mar 57 for after that our canon mount be fair for to play against the enemy also our horse fall on like heart of brass to show their valour and fidelity and we be ready both with hart and hand to fight our part as long as we can stand 58 but present tiding come we shall not fight but every man his quarter fair shall keep because it grow even some what to ward night which make the heart of many a soldier weep to see how base that same day be lose which do indeed the palsgraves country cost 59 for that same night our foe their trench get which be more safe than any castle strong not care then what we can do a jot and in the same they do remain so long till that they have even so increase their force that they be able to give we the worse 60 for winter come and our force grow weak our fare be hard and eke our payment bad our captain then with we do all betake to several town and of the same be glad and there we do in garrison remain till we be force to yield they up again 61 but not with ease this dare I tell you plain nor with the loss of small or little blood but with hard war they do the country gain with woeful spoil and but with little good town after town when they be very poor for until then we will not give they over 62 for there we keep unto commission come from England king unto our general and chichester that lord bring he the same with Frankindale we shall deliver all then we with honour march quite away for in the country there we may not stay 62 after that most nay indeed all the palatinate be lose both high and low yet my lord keep Frankindale till my lord of chichester bring commission from king james to deliver it up by way of composition 63 then every man have leave for to depart unto his country or where like he best be glad to march with poor and heavy heart to find some place where he may take his rest but many a man this can I true say do lose his life in come thence away 64 but God above do then preserve i so that I get down along the noble Rhine and do i keep even from the mortal foe that not one hurt I get in that same time but safe come to utrich where indeed I do get mean for to relieve my need 64 I get down the Rhine and come to utrich in the netherlands where I serve sir Ferdinando knightley until I come for England to go over with the four regiment 65 and here I stay under the state a while be under pay of noble knightley he think the best and time so to beguile till he think good his pass to give to i then do I come to England shore again but here I stay not long for to be plain 66 for that four noble peer be ready bend in foreign part their valour for to try and each of they a warlike regiment be man of courage and of spirit high oxford and Essex and Southampton three the four of these be noble Willoughby 66 these four peer have each a regiment that go over at the first time Breda be beleaguer and win by the enemy and where more be the pity the lord Henry earl of Oxford with over-heating himself at treheye sconce get such a vehement surfeit that at the hage in short time after he die as also do the earl of Southampton and the young and noble lord Wriothesley his son to the great grief of all the whole regiment at this voyage I get a shot in my head and then I come for England 67 these noble have captain of high degree to follow they be man of high renown and each of they a worthy company of soldier stout and of brave courage know but yet indeed this voyage be not the best two of the earl do die beside the rest 68 that in this great exploit do hope for gain and go with these same lord their worth to try but have no more but death even for their pain as it do prove and with they then go I but yet I come a fool as I do go with one shot more that I get from the Fo. 69 then present a press be new prepare for noble Mansfield dainty voyage be that as ever be in any age yet hear for hunger and extreme i will tell you what yet can I scarce now the same rehearse for why I shame to put it in my verse 69 this voyage of mansfield be the poor that ever soldier make for if they have lose their life in service and fair fight it have redownd to their honour but die so base as they do be starve be such a poor proceed as have not be hard of 70 it be so poor and bad and base withal that he declare I can well tell how for noble Mansfield so I will he call be in no fault this dare I swear and vow he do his best his soldier to maintain and honour to himself and they to gain 71 for many go in this disastrous voyage brave noble heart and valour true try as noble Cromwell dutton wise and sage that honour Ramsey and gallant rich beside and sir Ralph Hopton that same noble knight who worth be more than I can write of right 72 for when some other leave their soldier poor those that be he and leave to hungervild he do not leave they nor do give they over but like a faithful captain meek and mild do they relieve and leave they safe and sound though that it cost he many a hundred pound 73 now do I think I hear the vulgar cry that at this voyage some fault for sure there be else with vild hunger why do so many die upon shipboard and not to land do pass the soldier fault that be so bad at home the state will not let they on their land come 73 now by the censure of the common and vulgar sort count Mansfield be much blame but altogether unjust and unworthy for he be a very noble gentleman and of a high spirit stout and very courageous wise and gentle and expert in the war he be ever love to a honest soldier but hate a shark he have too many in this press more be the pity for it kill his noble heart when he be cut off from land they for indeed the fault be neither he nor any of the commander then appoint for that service for they be very noble gentleman but the main cause of this much loss on shipboard be the very roguery and inhuman carriage of the vulgar press soldier which make such spoil in all place of England as they go especial in Kent that the tiding come both to the ear of the french king as also to the state who hear what hurt and inhuman part they play in their own country be a kingdom of a commendable and civil government think they will make havoc in they where war be keep a foot therefore to prevent a great mischief they will not a they to come to shore and this their own base carriage bring their own ruin and this be the main cause of so much loss on shipboard 74 o getheringbarch what woeful work be there when overboard so many man be throw that every morn the water do appear with dead man corpse for to be overflow o soldier then beware take heed by this in your own country never do amiss 74 nothing can be more hateful to GOD then for a soldier who be command to fight for the truth of the gospel and for his king and country to be a traitor and enemy to it and by any colour or pretence to wrong the inhabitant of his own nation as God know too many of these soldier do be then press therefore God show his judgement upon they 75 but strive to do your king and country good and not the kingdom harm before you go for if you do you sure will lose your blood if not thus base yet before your foe you shall have shame and with disgrace shall die for God be just and just will you try 76 then soldier all bear you a honest mind and be press take heart of valour then and to your country ere be true and kind and with your foe be sure to fight like man so shall you gain credit and comfort brave and to your country much more welcome have 76 nothing in a soldier be more honourable then to be well condition and true to his country 77 then after this another voyage I go to Cadiz fair where sack do make such spoil that soldier have their wit therewith so spend that then with shame the foe give we the foil beside commission it be count bad and say the worst that ere general have 77 this voyage be too well know therefore I will say no more of it but that I go from Hull with sir William Courtney I have as good have have stay at home 78 but what it be I can true tell but by report and fame may tell a lie for with edge-tool I do not love to mell for they will cut therefore i will let they lie but how it be I can true say many be glad they come so well away 79 but present we have another press where I be send into the north country and do receive three hundred man no less all able man as any man may see where that indeed I then conductor be and bring they safe to Hull where they do pass 79 this voyage I go also from Hull with captain Francis conisby to the long line to general Morgan then for stoad leaguer but present I come back 80 over the sea with all the northern man to Denmark voyage and to the leaguer poor which be at stoad but I with they as then there do not stay but present come over even from long line where noble conisby do send i back with sir John Burlassie 81 now here I must the muse summon all with trumpet sound chief Melpomene to aid i here and show the heavy fall even of such worthy as I dare well say will vex great Mars within his court to find so many worthy of so noble mind 81 this i will of Ree voyage be not so poor as pitiful by reason of so great a loss of noble soldier and great commander the passage of it be too well know therefore I will say no more of it 82 as here be lose woe to that fatal chance and woe unto that more than dismal day that England have that overthrow by France which make the french for to presume and say from England yoke that they have ease their neck and bring brave England for to bow and beck 83 aswell as they have former be keep under command of England royal king now that obedience they away have sweep and of heroic victory now sing have their green die with our crimson gore of noble blood who loss we may deplore 84 but out alas what do the frenchman say and as the Spaniard nay the bo^ish dutch lay sack enough but in the english way they need no foe their valour be so much they will kill each other in their drunken fit for Bacchus be their god and spoil their wit 84 it be a ordinary brag of the Spaniard to give out that throw but a butt of sack in the way of the english and with their own help kill one another be drink will do more hurt in a english army than a thousand spaniard can do in Arms. 85 for Mars be banish quite and valour to unless it be in some brave mind man which be so few alas what can they do when in a hundred scarce you shall find ten that ere be press but they be breed so base that they have neither valour truth nor grace 85 and the dutch brag that they have change trade with the english for we have learn they to fight and they we to drink or else we have take the trade up at our own hand never be any apprentice to the same yet free without any order of l^w so now we english be the drinker and the drunken dutchmen brave soldier more be the pity 86 for any slave if he be never so bad be hold good enough to serve the king nay any thief whence ere he can be have which do good soldier oft to ruin bring for when they shall do service as they ought press to be go they be then to be seek 87 which make brave heart come oft by weep cross and loaf their life by such disaster base which may have honour but come home with loss both of their life and with most vild disgrace and then these slave to England will come over see never the foe yet beg for soldier poor 88 and tell you tale how cannon they do roar and how great Mars his trumpet brave do find and how they be lame and make exceed poor by that hard war in which they never be find but run away before it do begin to beg or steal their former course of sin 89 but why do I use this prolixity to speak of that which I can never mend yet pray I will and that most hearty that God and king will better soldier send against the foe of his bless royal blood for until then that we shall never do good 90 yet still i think the trumpet sound amain woe and alas when shall I ever see such noble heart tread english earth again as now be lose in this same i will of Ree rue we may call and rue we may that day the duke do find over Neptune flood the way 90 gentle reader give i leave this by the way to let thou understand that at our first go on we have good sport and very noble service and brave perform and with great credit to the lord general the duke and though at our come off we have the worse yet the french for all their brag need not so much boast of their gain or noble victory for first and last they lose a world of fine fellow but indeed it be god providence and foresee determination that we shall know we be all at his dispose and not as some scandalous and filthy reproachful tongue do use to give out to the derogation of the noble duke honour be the general all which for as far forth as I for my part can ever discern be altogether unjust for never can any general carry himself more love to all his soldier than he do not only to the commander and officer but even to the poor sentinel and none that be a soldier of worth and quality will I think or can just say but he be true noble of a very amiable and love disposition to all that have any suit unto he some foul tongue ^ave out that at the retreat and come off that my lord duke be then on shipboard but I be sure when it be dark night he be in the field and bring to the bridge a good quantity both of shot and powder for as he be of a amiable condition so be he of a stout and courageous spirit ever forward to further a honest and good soldier in his suit but a coward or a man of a preposterous or foul carriage he can never abide but never man yet live or die without enemy especial one so eminent no more do he much more be the pity 91 brave rich and burrows you there lose your breath and so do Bret and bingley both beside and radcliffe sweet my captain turn to earth brave Coningam who fame yet never die Heidon and blundel both two noble knight with York and Thornix take their last good night 92 with many more brave captain of great fame which lose their life and body turn to dust who I for we can but weep to name why say I so for to they that I must for sure I be all flesh be bear to die as be these gallant most unhappy 93 for former no age have ever know that englishman receive such vile disgrace nor chronicle past memory have show that brag France do England so debase as it do then within this paltry i will so many worthy of their life beguile 94 Mars do envy against great Neptune flood great Neptune he be vex at Mars again to see that i will drown with our english blood which water have enough about the same but now their pit be fill with purple gore as they be fill with saltish brine before 95 but for to leave this more than hapless place and those sweet soul in bliss that die therein for though their body be inter so base yet do their soul a Halleluia sing unto jehovah the bless God above who oft do visit who he best do love 96 but I poor man amongst all these worthy dead do escape alive and come to english shore be in my travel force to beg my bread with woeful wound which be both green and sore until to London that at length I come where I poor man a long time do lie lame 97 but when I be recover of the same unto the belgic state that I go over and there indeed I do take arm again to see what fortune will befall i more think far better there to live in pay then for to burden England any way 98 but yet alas I have not there be long till mastrick leaguer fall out very sore and cruel fate again do i that wrong that yet a shot unto my share fall more beside I lose my noble colonel good stout and devout as on the earth ere stand 98 here at mastrick I get another shot for my reward and that be all the preferment that fall to my share 99 so I poor soul be then disable quite be force to take the gesthouse courtesy where comfortless and without all delight I do remain in pain and misery until poor recover that I be then leave I arm and do to England pass 100 for after that my limb I get again I to my country then do make repair where for my service travel loss and pain I do request some pension for my share for I have serve thirty year and more in constant service never give it over 101 for which poor I must need^ constrain be to end my day like to a Anchorist and with what mean the gentry will give i content myself until I take my rest in earth wide womb where I must rot to dust God grant my soul it may live with the just now arm farewell brave soldier all adieu I be a soldier but I be none now yet be my heart to soldier ever true for I to Mars have make a constant vow that I will be a servant to he still in what I can his service to fulfil for though I can do king nor country good yet I a soldier from henceforth will be to jesus Christ who shed his precious blood to save that soul immortal be in i thus will I rest in faith and hope will I resolve be and never fear to die thus you have hear the whole catastrophe of
