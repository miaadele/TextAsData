Austerdame and of other place of the east country into which harbour also come two small bark of s. mallow in France load with corn for provision of the king fleet which be expect to come for Britain those two french ship have moor themselves a starne a hulk of Austerdame call the fortune chance to have her anckor come home and thwart the Frenchman so that it put he in some danger that betwixt they grow some hot speech the next day the Frenchman arrest the hulk for his damage and accuse unto the inquisition six of those hulk that their traffic be for englishman and that the good be all englishman whereupon they be stay to the king use and their man imprison which the Duchmen deny as just they may but the Frenchman on his oath aver the same so that there be no remedy but to lose their good and endanger themselves yet God who see the secret of all man heart and his pleasure lie they open to the world to show his wonder on earth and make his name more fear show this most gracious and wonderful miracle within 6. day after the conviction of those fleming the Frenchman have take order for unlode of their Corn^ as the master of the bark which accuse they be bust with his

manner without remedy albeit they have not want for the counsel of the approve physician in the whole land but God be just and will be know I pray God this example prove of sufficient force to turn their devilish mind to the knowledge of the true God who defend his child and will punish those stiffnecked miscreant that dishonour his name in this pamphlet also may thou see the reward of perjury and the just judgement of God in bereave his life that seek the life and destruction of those he have never see for a small offence by casualty commit for which they offer he large amends which may not suffice as also if God judgement may be conjecture by man how God be angry in relieve those which seek to dishonour his name with that corn which will have do good among that famous king of France his camp where it be need yet purloin by those rebel of his own country to maintain his enemy God make every man to amend his own fault and to fear that God will inflict the like plague upon our countryman that for gain rob the common wealth of victual and maintain the enemy of God and our country God give every man grace to forbear so desirous a mind of covetousness and make we thankful for all his benefit which through his mercy we daily receive amen
