1. COR. 16. V. 22.
If any man loue not the Lord
Iesus Christ, let him bee
Anathema Maranatha.

SAINT PAVL
being now to
close vp his Epistle
to the Corinthians,
and
hauing thus far
vsed the helpe of a Scribe is
willing to giue them the farewell
salutation in his owne
hand-writing: The salutation
of mee Paul with my owne hand,
in the verse before my Text.
His salutation in this as in all
the rest of his Epistles is a solemne
Apostolicall benediction,

wishing them the grace and
fauour of God in Iesus Christ
in the verse following my
Text. But now knowing too
well how many false brethren
there were at Corinth, who
were content indeed to professe
Christ for some outward
carnall respects,The misery of those that professe Christ for outward carnall respects. but did grossely
dissemble with him in their
hearts, least such should misapply
this comfortable salutation
vnto themselues, least such
dogs should imagine these holy
things to be giuen them, hee
salutes them after another manner,
and preuents their presumption
by this terrible, thundring
execration: If any man
loue not the Lord Iesus Christ,
let him bee Anathema Maranatha.
This Text is somewhat obscure
by reason of the strange
words which are in it which

(setting aside all curiosity) I
will vnfold as nakedly as I can,
that I may in few words lay
open a plaine way to the sense
and instructiue matter of this
Scripture.The interpretatio^ of the words Anathema Maranatha. The word Anathema
is a Greeke word: in English
it signifies Accursed: The
words Maran-atha are Syriack,
and signify in English, Our Lord
commeth. That the full meaning
of the holy Ghost in the vse of
these words may more cleerely
bee conceaued by you; you
are to bee aduertised that in
this Text there is an allusion
vnto the Iewish manner of
Excommunication which was
twofold.The Iewish manner of excommunication is twofold. 1. The first kinde of
it called Niddui was onely a
separation for a time, commonly
for thirty dayes from all co^merce
or society with any man
within a certaine distance. This
is thought to bee that which is

called in the New Testament a
a casting out of the Synagogue.
2. The second more seuere and
terrible then the former was,
when a scandalous offender
with curses out of the law of
Moses was in the publike audience
of the whole Church,
without any limitation of time
excluded from the communion
of it. This is thought to be that
which is called in the new Testament
a deliuering vp vnto
Sathan. This in Hebrew Cherem,
in Greeke is called (...),
which word you haue in
the Text.A twofold Anathema. This Anathema was
twofold. 1. Simple when what
I haue now mentioned was
performed. 2. With an addition,
Anathema Maran-atha,
when besides all other maledictions
out of the law they added
this clause, Our Lord commeth:
By which forme the excommunicated

person as desperate
and quite forlorne, without
all hope of pardon or restitution,
was left into the hands
of the Lord to receaue from
him an heauy doome at his co^ming.
This then being applied
vnto my Text the sense runnes
thus:The meaning of the Text. If any man loue not the
Lord Iesus Christ, let him bee
accursed and that in the most
desperate manner, expecting
due vengeance from the Lord
when hee commeth (...),
with his holy millions to
execute iudgement vpon all, and
to conuince all that are vngodly,
as it is in Enochs Prophesie recorded
by S. Iude, to which
this last degree of excommunication
Maran-atha (or as the
Syrians pronounce it) Moran-etho,
our Lord commeth, may
probably seeme to haue speciall
reference. If any man etc. By

any man vnderstand any man
that liues in the light of the
Gospell, that professes and
thinkes himselfe a Christian;
for to such S. Paul directs his
speech; if any man thus qualified
loue not Christ Iesus let
him bee accursed in the highest
degree. It cannot be expected
that such as sit in the darknesse
of Gentilisme should loue that
Christ whom they haue not
heard: and therfore albeit their
case bee lamentable because
they heare of no Sauiour, yet
sure theirs is farre more fearefull
who heare him daily preaching
in their streets, and take
little notice of him, but neglect
him and trample him vnder
foot. If any man loue not:
some imagine an Hebraisme to
lye couched in these words,
Loue not, supposing the sense
to bee, if any man hate; and indeed

this is the sense, but in my
weake iudgement the conceit
of an Hebraisme is needlesse,
seeing that as our Sauiour tells
vs Luk. 11. 23. Hee that is not
with him is against him, and
questionlesse, whosoeuer professes
his name, and yet loue
him not, hee hates him at the
very heart. But if my coniecture
deceaue me not, my Text
may receaue excellent light
from Ephes. 6. v. vlt. Grace be
with all them that loue our Lord
Iesus Christ (...), in purity
or sincerity. I suppose those
whom Saint Paul curses in my
Text to be directly opposed to
those whom hee there blesses;
and seeing to the Ephesians he
blesses those who loued Christ
with an vncorrupt, vnmixed,
vnfained loue, it's likely that in
my Text hee bestowes his imprecations
vpon those who*

great shewes of loue vnto
Christ with their mouthes, but
vnderualue and despise him in
their hearts.
The Text being thus explained
(not to mangle it with an
vnnecessary diuision) affords
this materiall doctrine. Whosoeuer
hee bee that professes
himselfe a Christian* and thinks
himselfe verily to bee so, and
yet hath not the loue of Christ
Iesus kindled and setled in his
heart is in a most dangerous and
cursed estate.
Great variety of reasons and
proofes might bee produced
for the inlargement and confirmation
of this point: those
which I intend to make vse of,2 Generall considerations premised for the confirmation of the point.
I will reduce vnto two gene^all
considerations which will
sufficiently manifest both how
fearefully and how iustly hee
stands accursed, who professing

Christ Iesus with his
mouth entertaineth him not
with his best affections in his
heart.1 All the curses of the Law are due vnto him, that doth not really loue Christ Iesus. 1. My first consideration
is this, that whosoeuer hath
not imbraced Christ Iesus with
the sweetest vnion of real loue,
hath no part in him, and therefore
all the curses of the Law
stand in full force against him.
I shall not need to insist vpon
the aggrauation of the wofull
condition of him who is yet in
bondage to the law. Marke, I
beseech you, the exquisite rigour
of it comprised in that one
sentence Deut. 27. 26. Gal. 3.
10. Cursed is euery one who continueth
not in all things which
are written in the booke of the
Law to doe them. O then how
infinitely accursed are all of vs
naturally, who on the contrary,
haue continued in the violation
of all things which are

written in it. I am perswaded
(howsoeuer some proud heretiques
of these times haue prated)
that there is no man so stupid,
or senselesse of the misery
of being tried by the Law with
out any appeale vnto the Gospell
but in his serious moodes
when God shall in some measure
awak his co^science, he will
confesse it had beene better for
him neuer to haue been borne,The wofull estate of him to whom the Law shall be a Iudge.
then that God without the mediation
of his Sonne should call
him to a punctuall account for
the most harmelesse and vnoffensiue
day of his whole life.
Now what can a man haue to
comfort and secure his soule in
these sad meditations but this,
that God is superabundantly
mercifull, in so much that hee
sent his owne Sonne to redeeme
vs from the curse of the law, and
to bee made a curse for vs, Galat.

3. 13. These indeed are
heauenly consolations and such
as neuer faile those who are
rightly qualified for them: But
now they appertaine not to
such as loue not Christ Iesus, to
such as know not how to value
and worthily esteeme the glorious
purchases of his passion.
It's true;Gods mercy excludes not his Iustice. God is mercifull infinitely
aboue all finite conceit,
but so is hee iust too: Magnifie
his mercy as long as thou wilt,
thou canst neuer doe it enough,
but when all is done thou maist
say as much for his iustice as S.
Paul, Rom. 11. 22. equally admires
the goodnesse and seuerity
of God. Whosoeuer he be then,
who lookes for mercy from
God without Christ, who only
hath satisfied his iustice,
dreames not so much to finde
God mercifull as to finde
him vniust. Now to come neerer
to the point, can any man

bee so sottish or impudently
presumptuous as to hope to
fare the better for Christ who
sees nothing desirable in him?
Who is so far from counting all
things dung, that hee may winne
him, as S. Paul did, Phil. 3.
8. that hee euen prefers dung
the basest trash and vanities of
the world before him?They can ^aue no ^enefit by Christ who prefer plea^ure or profit before him. Is it
likely that hee should haue any
reliefe from the Gospell, who
is so farre from counting all
things losse for the excellency of
the knowledge contained in it, as
Saint Paul did, that he can tast
no such excellency in it, that he
should loose one farthing, forbeare
one pleasure, forgoe one
vanity for it. Our Sauiour himselfe,
Mat. 10. 37. expresly
tels vs, He that loueth Father or
Mother more the^ me is not worthy
of mee, that is, whosoeuer
loues what he hath best reason

to loue in this life more the^ his
Sauiour, is not worthy to haue any
benefit by him, to haue any
share in his merits? What then
thinke wee, can they expect
from him, who are so coldly
affected towards him, that they
preferre euery trifle before
him? All the promises of God
(saith the Apostle) 2. Cor. 1.
20. in him (in Christ Iesus) are
yea, and in him Amen, that is,
sure and infallible. But still in
Christ Iesus. And what's this
to any man if hee himselfe bee
not in him? And how can hee
bee in him but by louing him.
The accursed estate of the falsehearted
Christian who presumes
much vpon CHRIST,
whom indeed he hath nothing
to doe with, will more affright
him if hee would but
consider it in other men. Who
is there amongst vs but will

much pitty and bemoane the
lamentable condition of the
poore Indians,The lame^table condition of the sauage Indian. and other Sauages
of the vnchristian world,
whose soules are ouer clouded
with the blackest mists of irreligion
that the Prince of darkenes
can possibly inwrap them,
who come into the world
knowing not wherefore, and
goe out of it dreaming not
whither, but liue here a while
without God in the world, and
then goe to the generation of
their fathers, where they shall
neuer see the light to vse the
words of the Psalmist, Psal. 49.
19. A heauy case indeed beyond
all expression of a Tragedy,
A formall Christian is in as bad a case in respect of the world to come as the Silliest Indian. and which cannot bee sufficiently
bewailed with an ocean
of teares of blood. But
now whosoeuer hee bee within
the Paradise of the Christian
Church who hath nothing to

distinguish him from these miscreants
but his outward conformity
to the lawes and customes
of the place where hee
liues, who hath nothing to
proue himselfe a Christian but
outward formalities, the charity
of other men and his owne
sleight imaginations whosoeuer
hee bee that hath not as
yet espied something in Christ.
Iesus so amiable as that in earnest
it may challenge his whole
heart before all the pompe and
pleasure in the world, I say
that man whosoeuer hee bee
may keepe his moanes and
teares for himselfe: it's his
owne case: for, for the present
vntill the spirit of grace shall
startle him vnto more sense of
the mercies of Christ, hee is in
as bad a case as the silliest Indian.
I meane in respect of the
world to come, for for in this

life the most dissembling Christian
is partaker of many sweer
blessings which the Gospell
vses to carry about with it fro^
countrey to countrey, by which
it ciuillizeth and pollisheth the
most rude and barbarous nations.
But for the ioyes of eternity,
what better clayme can
hee lay vnto them then the
wild American? Hee hath no
more to doe with Christ then
the other. Hee hath liued indeed
where hee hath heard
much talke of Christ, of redemption,
and the glorious liberty
of the Sonnes of God;
but what's all this to him
who could neuer rellish any of
these things, who neuer tooke
them to heart,It is a pure sincere loue of Christ that distinguisheth vs from Infidels. neuer could find
any sweetnesse in them but
passed them ouer like some vncouth
mysticall fables? Beloued
we must not thinke that liuing,

within the ayre of the
Gospell, amongst Churches
and Bibles, can distinguish vs
from Infidels, exempt vs from
the rigour of the law, and entitle
vs to Christ? No such matter.
Christ came vnto his own but
his owne receaued him not, saith
S. Iohn^ were his own then euer
the better for him? Not a whit.
Our Sauiour whilst hee was
talking with the Iewes, Ioh. 3.
40. tells them. Yee will not
come vnto mee that yee might
haue life: Hee was come vnto
them, but they would not
come vnto him. Albeit then
Christ visit vs neuer so frequently,
if wee welcome him
not with that ioy with which
Zacheus once did, though hee
passe neuer so often by our
hearts, if wee inuite him not
in, and get him to sup and lodge
with vs, wee must looke to get

no more by him then those vnhappy
mis^reants who neuer
heard of his name. It's considerable
to this purpose which
S. Paul hath, Gal. 5. 6. In
Christ Iesus neither circumcision
nor vncircumcision auaileth any
thing, but faith which worketh
by loue, that is, outward markes
or priuiledges aduantage a man
nothing in Christ Iesus vnlesse
hee bee so sensibly perswaded
of those miracles of compassion
which Christ hath performed
for his soule, that vpon
this perswasion hee thinkes he
can neuer loue him enough and
therefore submits his whole
soule vnto him in a vniuersall
obedience vnto his will.
To draw towards a conclusion
of this point,An explanation of Psal. 2. Kisse the Sonne, etc. let vs scanne
a little Psal. 2. 12. Kisse the
Sonne least hee bee angry and yee
perish from the way^ and this

Psalme containes a cleere prophecie
of our Sauiour and such
great ones of the world as
should oppose themselues against
him, whom yet the Prophet
vouchsafeth to direct, v.
10. For all this they might
make their peace with God:
the chiefe part of the direction
is set downe in the words
which you haue now heard;
Kisse the Sonne, that is, reuerence,
respect, embrace the
Sonne of God. Why so? Least
by his anger yee perish from the
way: from what way? The Syriack
interpreteter tells you m^
vrkeh from his way. He himselfe
is the onely way vnto his
Father, to whom no man commeth
but by him, as himselfe
tells vs in the Gospell. Whosoeuer
therefore stands off from
Christ Iesus, and striues not to
kisse, that is, to be vnited vnto

him by the choisest twinnes of
dearest affection must needes
perish out of the way to life,
continue still in his sinnes expecting
all the curses of the Law
to fal vpo^ him. The law was our
Schoolemaster to bring vs vnto
Christ, saith the Apostle, Gal.
3. 24. What to bring vs within
the sound of his name? To
bring vs to talke and discourse
of him? More then so, to amaze
vs with the horrour of our sins,
and to make vs ^eele what need
wee haue of a Sauiour, and hauing
one offered vs, to lay fast
hold on him whatsoeuer it cost
vs, and to prize him aboue all
the Iewels in the world. But if
the Law* cannot preuaile so
much with vs as to make vs
groane for a redeemer, to make
vs come crouching vnder our
burdens vnto Christ Iesus, wee
must continue still vnder the

lash, It's true which the Apohath,
v. seq. that after faith is
come wee are no longer vnder a
Schoolemaster: But if this faith
which is inseparably ioyned
with loue neuer come, we are
sure to smart vnder his heauy
hand through all eternity.
You haue heard the first part
of his burden who in the light
of the Gospell does not really
loue Christ Iesus to wit, that he
has no part in Christ and therfore
all the curses of the law belong
vnto him. One would thinke
there needed no more to bee
said to proue him accursed who
loues not Christ Iesus seeing
this hauing no part in him includes
more horrours and terrours
then it's possible for the
braine of man to shape the Ideates
of. But I must tell you that
as heauy a doome as this is, yet
is it but light in comparison of

which I shall describe vnto
you in a second consideration,2 Consideration.
to wit,Great plagues remaine for those that doe not sincerely loue Christ but doe co^temne the Gospell. whosoeuer hee be that
is Catechised and brought vp
in the Christian profession and
yet doth not heartily and sincerely
affect Christ Iesus besides
all the curses due vnto his
sinnes against the Law, he treasures
vp vnto himselfe a farre
more compleat vengeance for
his disesteeme and contempt of
the Gospell. It were well, beloued,
if when Christ Iesus
comes vnto a man and that man
receaues him not, if hee left
him in no worse case then hee
found him, though that were
vnconceauably miserable: But
it's neuer so. For if hee entertaynes
not Christ as a Sauiour,
hee is sure to haue him hence
forth his accuser, and if he will
not admit him ad salutem, hee
shall haue him whether hee

will or no ad Testimonium. It's
true which our Sauiour told
Nicodemus Ioh. 3. 17. That
God sent not his Sonne into the
World to condemne the world,
but that the world through him
be saued: Christ doth not knocke
at any mans heart with that intent
that he may haue the more
aduantage against him if he let
him not in, no hee comes with
purpose and desire to brind in
saluation with him, but if hee
and his saluation be so little regarded
that we entertaine him
onely with a few cold complements
at doore, as I may say,
and so dismisse him. O then he
goes away in a rage, complaines
to his father that for such vngratefull
wretches hee shed his
dearest blood. And therefore
though God sent not his Sonne
into the world to condemne it,
yet it followes in the next

verse, Hee that belieueth not is
condemned already, because hee
belieueth not in the name of the
onely begotten Sonne of God.
Condemned etc. hee beleeueth
not. Why? the Law had sufficiently
co^demned him before.
True, but now God offers him
a pardon by his Son to exempt
him from co^demnation, which
seeing hee scornes, or cares not
to accept, God will now not
onely haue the other condemnation
to continue it's force against
him, but hee will load
him with another more heauy,
which shall neuer be reuersed
by any pardon. This is made
more plaine by the verse following,
This is the condemnanation
that light is come into the
world and men loue darknesse rather
then light, that is; For
this is that great and finall
condemnation, which can neuer

bee remitted, as that of the
Law may, that Christ is come
into the world bringing redemption
with him,The contempt of the Gospell of Christ can neuer be remitted. and men
are so little sensible of it, so
dully affected with it, that they
care not for making any vse of
him, but had rather continue
Satan's prisoners still, then
come forth into his maruailous
light. So that the neglect of
Christ Iesus and his Gospell, is
that which makes a man compleatly
Anathema Maranatha,
because if we passe by him there
remaines henceforth no more sacrifice
for sinne but a fearefull
expectations of Judgement: Hebr.
10. 26. Mistake mee not beloued,
when I say there remaines
no more sacrifice for sinne to
those who haue passed by Christ
Iesus, I meane such as haue
passed him by for good and all,
such as are not entirely incorporated

into him before they
are snatched out of this life. For
indeed wee haue a redeemer so
sensible of our infirmities that
when hee comes a wooing vnto
our soules, hee will not bee
driuen away at the first deniall.
Alas, if he should be so touchy,
there would hardly euer any
soule bee espoused to him, seeing
all of vs naturally hang
backe, find excuses, and make
many pauses* and demurres,
before wee giue our consent.
But our Sauiour is so patient
towards our follies, that for all
his repulse hee will vouchsafe
to come againe and againe,
waite our leasure,The wofull estate of those that deny the gratious proffers of Christ Iesus. take all opportunity
sollicite the businesse
by his holy spirit. But here is
no ground for presumption. For
whosoeuer denies him so often,
or so peremptorily, that he
is forced as if it were to leaue

of his sute, during the life of
the party, or whosoeuer dallies
so long with him, that hee is
called out of this life (as who
can promise himselfe an houre)
before the match bee made vp,
I say whosoeuer shall sleight
his Sauiour, or neglect him
after this manner, it had beene
a thousand times better for
him, that Christ had neuer been
borne into the world, or at
least that himselfe had beene
borne in such an obscure corner
of it, that hee had neuer heard
of him. For his outward profession
of and with all the prerogatiue,
of it, with which hee
contented himselfe without any
hearty loue vnto him, the
faire offers of saluation which
hee had, and made nothing of,
shall presse him more heauily at
the day of Iudgement, then all
his sins against the law, though

they were murders, and adulteryes;
when for these very
reasons it shall bee easier for
Turkes, Americans, and Virginians
then for him.
If you demand the reason of
all this mischiefe,The reason of all this mischiefe that falls vpon the contemners of Christ^, is because the contempt of the Gospell is a sinne against all Persons in the Trinity. it is because
the not laying to heart of what
Christ hath done for vs, and the
not-receiuing him being offered
vs with the thankefull affections
of loue and reuerence,
vnmixed delight, and compleat
content in him is the highest
dishonour, and basest indignity
(except wilfull Apostacy, or
malious blasphemy) which
can bee offered by a sinfull
man to the most blessed and
glorious Trinity. Should I stand
^o recount and amplify euery
circumstance of it, I thinke I
should both weary and amaze
you. Suffice it therefore onely
briefly to consider how contempt

offered to Christ and his
Gospell reflects vpon all the
Persons of the Blessed Trinity.
For the Father,1. Against the Wisdome of the Father. whosoeuer
sets light by his Sonne doth
most grosly vnderualue both
his wisdome and his goodnesse.
For his wisdome. The contriuing
of mans redemption by
the death of his Sonne in the
fulnesse of time is, so farre as is
reuealed to vs, the master-piece
and chiefe plot (with reuerence
bee it spoken) which hath been
from all eternity thought on
by that infinite boundlesse wisdome
of God blessed for euer;God intended to get him more glory by the redemption then the creation of mankind.
whereby hee purposed to get
himselfe farre more glory then
hee did by the creation of the
world, when by a deliuerance
so superlatiuely admirable hee
should both saue mankind, and

astonish it. This is that for
which the Gospell is so often
called the wisdome of God vnto
saluation. This is that mistery of
Godlynesse which is great (...)
by the confession of all
without controuersy 1 Tim. 3.
16. This is that illustrious mystery
of saluation which the Prophets
enquired after, and searched
diligently with the Angels
to looke into 1. Pet. 1. 10. 12.
Lastly this is that (...)
that wisdome of God which
hath such curious variety in it
Ephes. 4. 10. Well then to
come to the point when the
time is come (as it is come to
vs, who liue in this blessed
noone-tide of the Gospell) that
God reueales to any man this
astonishing mystery of his infinite
wisdome, when hee pleaseth
to shew any man how admirably
hee hath contriued his

saluation for him, by sending
his own sonne to satisfy his iustice,
and therefore expects abundance
of glory by it: if that
man now abase varlet, created
by God that hee might applaud
his lesser works of creation,
shall behaue himsele so stupidly,
that hee, forsooth, can scarse
haue patience to take a full
view of his Sonne, if hee can
espie no such arte in the contriuance
as may rauish him, no
such wonders as may withdraw
his minde from those
bawbles, about which it was
before busied, O beloued, this
is an indignity to the glorious
wisdome of God the Father,
beyond all expression of mortall
eloquence.
2. For his goodnesse and
mercy.2. Against the goodnesse and mercy of the Father. God the Father from
euerlasting beholding mankind
in the vgly masse of corruption,

through their owne wilfull rebellion
knew he must bee iust,
and yet desired to bee mercifull.
And when nothing might
make these two stand together,
but satisfaction from one as infinite
as himselfe, that he might
commend his loue to vs, as the
Apostle speakes Rom. 3. 8.
hee resolued not to spare
(...) the sonne of his Loue
as hee is called by a significant
Hebraisme, Col: 1. v. 13. but to
send him in similitude of sinnefull
flesh, to vndergoe that heauy
businesse for vs, presuming as it
is in the parable that howsoeuer
his other messengers had
fared but ill in the world, yet
his Sonne the heire should bee
entertained with reuerence. O
then can wee imagine with
what hellish contempt they
euen defye the loue of God towards
them, who look strangely

vpon his Sonne, who behaue
themselues towards him, as if
his Father had sent him in a
needles err and into the world,
or as if there needed not to
haue beene all this care taken
for them.
2. In the next place it
would bee an endlesse businesse
to rehearse the indignities
which are offered to the
second person in Trinity Christ
himself by such as call him
Lord,2. Against the Sonne because his death and passion is vilified and co^temned. Lord, but yet deale not
honestly with him in their
hearts. Greater loue then this
hath no man, then that hee lay
downe his life for his friend saith
our Sauiour Ioh. 15. 13. True
Lord, it's the greatest loue that
one friend can shew another,
but yet thy loue was greater u^to
vs in that thou laydest down
thy life for thy enemies, yea in
that thou vouchsafedst for

our sakes to take such a life
which thou mightst lay down.
Consider in briefe I beseech
you, how the Sonne of God
out of meere obedience vnto
his Father and compassion vnto
vs rebellious wormes (...)
emp^tied himselfe of the lustre
of his Deity, and in the forme of
a seruant humbled himselfe to
the death ^uen the most painefull,
and shamefull death of the
Crosse Phil. 2. 8. Peruse the
history of his passion, yea of his
whole life which was litle better
then a passion,The bitternesse of Christs Passion. obserue how
throughly the sad predictions
of a despised life and ignominious
death Isa. 53. were fulfilled
in him, how in euery
point hee was made isch enacc^both
a man of sorrowes, draw
into a Catalogue the rude discourtesies,
churlish affronts, the
^euilings, bu^^etings, spittings,

torments, agonies and the contradictions
of sinners all along
(that is) of sinnefull caytifes
which hee indured with patience.
Lastly remember that all
this befell him onely because
the Lord laid vpon him the iniquity
of vs all Isa. 53. 6. where
the Hebrew phrase is elegantly
significant, hiphgiah, he hath
made the iniquity of vs all to
meet, on him, as our translators
haue rightly expressed it in the
margent. Remember still I say
that all this was but what wee
had deserued and therefore we
may well suppose him with
pitifull moanes crying out vnto
vs vpon the Crosse in the
mouing language of Ierusalem
Lam: 1. 12. Is it nothing to all
you that passe by; behold and see
if there bee any sorrow like vnto
my sorrow. Now beloued whosoeuer
hee bee that hath read

or heard all these things so punctually
set downe in the Gospell
that hee hath had his sauiour
euen crucified before his eyes,
whosoeuer is conceited and he
beleeues this history and yet
cannot bleed within or weepe
without for his sinnes which
were the cause of it, but can
bee moued to more tender passions
by a Tragicke fable created
by the braine of a Poet cannot
sympathise with his Sauiour
in that passio^ which should
haue beene his,Christ is more tormented by our ingratitude then hee was by his passion. cannot by his
serious co^punction share with
him in those agonies which
should haue been all his owne,
cannot take these mercies so
deepely to heart as with the
earnest pangs of yerning affections
to desire to bee crucified
with Christ as S. Paul speakes
of himselfe Gal. 2. 20. and to
liue the rest of his life in the flesh

by the faith of the Sonne of God;
who loued him and gaue himselfe
for him, questionlesse that man
offers his Sauiour the most cutting
iniury, and does him the
most villanous spight that it's
possible for a mortall wretch
to offer vnto the Lord of Glory.
That mans ingratitude is
more painefull vnto Christ Iesus
then all the thornes were in
his head, and wounds him more
deepely then the nayles did his
hands and feete; and therefore
wee cannot imagine a lighter
curse then Anathema Maranatha
to bee due vnto him. For
by his sottish neglect of that
death of which his sins aswel as
any mans else were a cause, he
becomes guilty of the murther
of the Sonne of God, yea one
of those (...),
by (...), I vnderstang (...)
and English it, who crucifie

as much as in them lies the
sonne of God (...)
and expose him like a^ malefactour
to publique shame.
Heb. 6. 6.
3 Lastly whosoever instructed
in the Gospell doth
not in earnest loue Christ Iesus
hee vexes and grieues the third
person in Trinity the Holy
spirit,3. Against the holy Ghost because his labour for loue to Christ is in vaine. whose chiefe businesse
here below is to worke our
our hearts vnto the loue of
Christ, and as I said before to
solicite the match betweene
him and our soules. And this is
one reason why our saviour being
to leaue this world,
speakes so much in Saint Iohn
of what the comforter should
doe for him after his departure.
He shall testify of me Iohn
13. He shall glorify mee 16. 14.
Whosoeuer therefore makes
the Holy spirit to labour in

vaine not suffering his perswasions
to make any impressions
vpon his heart, or to get thence
any glory for him whose agent
hee is but thinkes hee does
Christ Iesus kindnesse enough
in that he suffers himselfe to be
called a Christian rather then
a Iew or a Mahumetan, or Protestant
rather then a Papist. In
what a fit of discontent, in
what a chafe (may we thinke)
doth that man send or rather
driue away the spirit of
Grace. All that I haue said in
this second consideration is
comprised in that terrifying
place Hebr. 10. 28. 29. which
I know is there applyed vnto
Apostates, but wee must note
that all hypocrites, are Apostates
in Gods fight, and therefore
what wee may apply vnto
an Apostate in particular,
because hee discouers the rottennesse*

of his heart in the
sight of men, wee may apply
vnto hypocrites in generall
because there is in them the
same evill heart of vnbeliefe
though wee cannot so particularly
smell them out: the
words are. Hee that despised
Moses Law, died without mercy,
vnder two or three witnesses,
of how much sorer punishment
suppose yee, shall hee be thought
worthy, who hath troden vnder
foote the sonne of God, and hath
counted the blood of the covenant
wherewith he was sanctified
(...) (as the blood of a
common man, or a malefactor
not as the blood of a sacrifice)
and hath done despight vnto the
spirit of grace.
Applic. You see the fearefully
accursed estate of those
professors of Christianity who
deale falsely with their Saviour,

and loue him not at the
heart, you see vpon what slippery
tearmes wee stand betweene
the greatest curses, and
the greatest blessings.1 The benefit of embracing Christ and his Gospel. If wee
haue indeed made Christ Iesus
our portion, if wee haue beene
so feelingly affected with his
favours towards vs that now
with the Spouse in the Canticles
wee are even sicke with
loue of him. If as the Apostle
prayes for the Ephesians, Wee
are so rooted and grounded in
loue that we can bring good
proofes, that with a constant
resolution we preferre the intellectuall
pleasures which issue
from his reconciled countenance
before whatsoeuer
else is most pretious and deare
vnto vs, O then we may hugge
our selues as men over-joyed,
for as sure as God is God, all
his rich promises in Christ Iesus

shall be yea and Amen vnto
vs. But on the contrary if
those heauenly raptures and
glorious trances of sweetest
entercourse betweene Christ
and our soules sound as Phantastique
dreames and harsh Paradoxes
vnto vs,2. The da^ger of a meere outward profession of Christs Gospell. if wee stupidly
content our selues with an
empty profession of his name
and heartlesse conformity vnto
the outward garb of the
Gospell, never striuing either
to expresse or to feele the inward
power of it, if wee goe
on in a heavy, sluggish dull
manner, never retiring vnto
our Saviour but in some melancholy
moodes which wee
are quickly weary of, blindly
presuming of much from him,
and caring not how little hee
hath from vs: O then we most
grossely delude our selues: for
the curse of curses Anathema

Maran-atha doth most certainely
belong vnto vs, I presume
almost there is not any
man in this assembly but
would thinke himselfe much
wronged if one should seriously
tell him hee did not loue
Christ Iesus: Not loue Christ?
Why we imagine wee all doe
it naturally, wee take it as the
custome of the country to say
so, It is not my purpose to dishearten
any man, would to
God that the least sparke of
loue vnto Christ in any mans
heart here were a glorious
flame. But yet I would haue no
man to deceiue himselfe in
this point then which nothing
more easy, nothing more dangerous.
God is not mocked, he
requireth truth in the inward
parts and the exactest kinde of
loue that can be imagined. Doe
you thinke beloued but that

the Iewes in our Saviours time
were confidently perswaded
that they loued God: they
persecuted our Saviour indeed
because they could not
apprehend him to be the sonne
of God, but for God himselfe
they made full account that
they, and none but they loued
him aright. Here was, I dare
say, as strong a perswasion of
loue to God,It is dangerous to be confident in a customary loue to God. if confidence
would beare out the matter as
in the greater part of Christians
of their loue vnto Christ.
But behold how miserably
they were deceaued Joh. 5.
42. our Saviour expressely tels
them, But I know you that yee
haue not the loue of God in you.
The like grosse deceit of the
Iewes may be observed in the
same chapter about their loue
vnto Moses, why they were
(...) and naile for Moses. The

Law and name of Moses was
the glory of their nation for
which no doubt but many if
they had beene put to it would
resolutely haue lost their liues
in our Saviours time as their
ancestors had done before or
their posterity since, so that
one would haue thought hee
might haue sworne they loued
Moses, but yet when the matter
comes to scanning you shall
finde there was no such matter,
for indeed they were so
false hearted to Moses that at
the last day hee shall bee their
chiefe accuser, witnesse our
Saviour verse 45. There is one
that accuseth you in whom yee
trust, that is, on whom yee
presume, for had you belieued
Moses etc. Lastly, to rouze vs
out of the slumber of our presumption,
let vs take notice of
one example more taken out of

Mat. 7. 22. Luc. 13. 26. where
we reade, that many shall come
at the last day vnto Christ, presuming
vpon their familiarity
with him, some telling him
they had eaten and dranke in
his presence, some expostulating
with him, Lord haue wee not
prophesied in thy name, cast out
divells, and done many wonderfull
workes. Would you imagine
all this could bee without
great loue vnto Christ: O how
confident should we be if we
had such evidence of our vnion
with him. How safe should
we thinke our selues, could we
challenge acquaintance with
him vpon the same te armes
when he shall come in his glory
to judgement. But yet you
see all this might doe vs no
good, seeing our Saviour will
send many such packing with
an angry protestation that hee

knowes them not, and if he will
not know them, you may bee
sure they were such as had not
for all these florishes dealt
kindly and louingly, with him.
Wherefore beloued, you see
how much it concernes vs to
pause a while on this matter*
We all thinke we loue Christ
Iesus: it were well if thinking
would serue the turne, but
wee see that many, who
thought as confidently as wee,
and perhaps vpon better
grounds, shall then perceaue
themselues mistaken, when it
shall be too late to remedy it.
O then let vs not venture our
selues vpon such groundlesse
surmises, but while wee haue
time to make all sure. Let vs
make it a businesse to settle the
estate of our soules which hang
vpon such nice points, let not
our shallow presumptious

conceipts of our loue to Christ,
let not the lazinesse and vntowardnesse
of our flesh hinder
vs from a speedy, impartiall,
industrious examination
of our hearts, whether they
haue indeed the loue of Christ
in them or no.
If vpon due enquiry wee
finde in our selues the true
ground of loue vnto our Saviour,The infallible notes of reall loue vnto Christ.
to wit a tender affectionate
apprehension of our infinite
deserued miseries, and his
infinite vndeserued mercies,
if wee feele the fruits of it a
constant, even, vniversall resolution
to please him in all
things, at all times, in all companies,
a disesteeme of whatsoever
is honourable or pleasant
in the world in comparison
of his favour, a continuall
hunger and thirst after a neerer
and more sensible communion

with him, I say if vpon
exact triall thou finde in thy
selfe these infallible notes
of reall loue vnto thy Saviour,
then I hope it will not
repent thee of thy labour.
For now thou knowest vpon
what ground thou standest,
now thy ioy may bee full, assuring
thy selfe that thou shalt
haue a confidence which shall
not deceiue thee before thy
Sauiour at his appearing. Contrariwise
if when thou entrest
into thy heart, thou findest no
sacred fire vpon the hearth but
all cold and vncomfortable, if
thou hast not yet beene acquainted
with those prickings
of heart and affrightments of
conscience for thy sinnes,
which vsually put poore humbled
soules into those vehement
fits of loue vnto our Sauiour,

If thou canst giue no reason
of thy supposed loue vnto,
Christ from any thing that thou
hast felt in thy selfe but onely
fro^ what other men say, fro^ the
Lawes and customes of the place
where thou art a subiect, then
thou findest thy selfe but in an
vnhappy case; yet thou art happy
in this that thou knowest the
worst of thy selfe, and maist
seeke out betimes for an effectuall
remedy. If this bee thy
case consider seriously that thou
art yet vnder the heauy curse
in my Text, and therefore impatient
of this accursed estate,
recollect thy selfe and call a
speedy assembly of thy best
wits, and then bethinke thy
selfe that Christianity is no lu^dicrous,
or iesting matter, that
the professio^ of Christ the most
serious businesse in the world,
that therfore questionlesse there

is a great deale more in it, then
the formalities of comming to
Church, carrying a bible, hearing
a sermon, that without
doubt Christ requires a reall
inward disposition of the soule
which should season all these
complements and make them
acceptable.
3. Consider in the next place
the summe and scope of Christianity
which is onely to shew
how miserable thou art by sin*The summ and scope of Christianity.
and how happy thou mayst bee
in Christ. When thou art come
thus farre, set the lookingglasse
of the Law before thee
and terrify thy selfe with the
vgly deformities and loathsome
staines of thy soule through the
guilt of sinne, then turne vnto
the Gospell and consider how
Christ Iesus out of the abundance
of his loue with which
hee loued thee being his enemy,

shed his deerest blood to
wash away these staines from
thy soule as very a wretch as
thou art as well as any mans
else.
4. Lastly,Prayer the best armor of a Christian. hauing thy soule
attentiuely fixed vpon this, betake
thy selfe to earnest prayer,
and with strong cries and groanes
improtune the spirit of grace to
enlighten the eyes of thy vnderstanding,
that thou maist bee
able to comprehend with all
Saints what is the breadth,
length, and height, and depth,
and to know the loue of Christ,
which passeth knowledge, Eph.
3. 19. Doe this from thy heart,
and continue in it a while with
an eager patience, and then I
dare bee bold to say that thou
shalt feele a strange alteration
in thy selfe, then shalt thou
feele (...)
not one simple commotion in

thy soule but an assembly and
throng of passions, then shalt
thou bee acquainted with those
scalding affections to Christ Iesus
which holy men haue felt
in all ages and striued to expresse
in their soliloquies but
could not, yea the greater sinner
thou hast beene the more wilt
thou with MARIE Luc. 7.
lay about thee with teares of
sorrow, and teares of ioy, and
in a holy kinde of distraction
striue to loue much because
much is forgiuen thee. Lastly
thou wilt plainely see how villanously
hitherto thou hast dissembled
with thy Sauiour, and
what a deale of Angelicall co^fort
thou hast lost by being a
stranger vnto him, and hauing
once after some cloudy scuds of
penitent sadnes recouered the
light, thou wilt reioyce as the
wise men when they recouered

light of the starre with exceegreat
ioy and follow it through
thicke and thinne, through
all difficulties and oppositions
whatsoeuer til thou shalt come
to see him as he is in incomprehensible
splendor amongst infinite
millio^s of glorified Saints
and Angels; To whom with
the Father and blessed Spirit
the three glorious persons and
one most infinite Deity bee ascribed
all honour, power,
might, maiestie and dominion
now and for euer, Amen.
FINIS.




EPHES. 6. V. 24.
Grace bee with all them that
loue our Lord Iesus Christ
in sincerity.

NOr to mispend any
good time in a
needlesse preface,
my text is part of
the farewell close
of an heauenly Epistle, wherein
the composer of it in the solemne
forme of a benediction
wisheth Grace (that is) all
those precious mercies and glorious
benefits which flow from
the grace and fauour of God,

vnto all such as loue Christ Iesus
in sincerity. The originall
hath (...) in incorruption,
as our translatours haue expressed
it in the margent, the
sense is all one, for to loue
Christ in sincerity, is to embrace
him intirely without any
rottenesse of heart, without any
vnsoundnesse of affections,
without any mixture of hypocrisie.
The Greeke Scholiast
conceiued the Apostle by the
word (...) to haue required
not so much the sincerity, as
perpetuity of loue vnto Christ
in those whom he blesses, and
therefore hee expoundeth it
by the aduerb (...), v^derstanding
it not so much of a
pure vncorrupt, as of a constant
incorruptible loue, which yet
alwayes presupposeth the other.
I confesse the word may
very well sit vnder this interpretation,

but yet I preferre
the former before it, and both
a great deale before Beza's
(with due reuerence vnto so
incomparable a man) who hath
turned all quite another way,
referring (...) not to loue
but to grace, and taking it for
(...) ad immortalitatem,
as if the sense were to be, Grace
bee with all them which loue
Christ Iesus, vntill they come
or to bring them vnto immortality.
The construction of the
word which our translatours
haue made choyce of, hee reiects
because hee could not remember,
that (...) had any
where that signification, I confesse
it's a very rare one, and
for that reason I haue insisted
vpon it, being perhaps not to
bee found in the new Testament,
but if any man please to
looke in the 2. to Tit. v. 7. hee

shall there find the word, and
hardly capable of any other co^struction.
Beza indeed suspecting
that it crept out of the
margent into the text, hath
there left it quite out, which
I wonder at, seeing himselfe
confesses that hee found it in
the ancient Greeke Copies,
wherefore I suppose without
any preiudice to the discourse
which I shall build vpon
this scripture I may proceed
confidently according to
our owne translation especially
seeing I know some six more
of good note which all read either
in, or with sincerity: In
briefe then, the meaning of my
text is this, Let the fauour of
God and al those blessings which
issue from it, rest vpon those
who doe not by groundlesse
presumptio^s flatter themselues
or counterfeit appearance perswade

others that they loue
Christ Iesus, but doe in very
deed and good earnest loue him
with all their hearts, and with
all their soules. Or thus, Let
the gracious promises of God
in Christ be fulfilled vpon them
and them onely, who embrace
and obey his Gospell with
sound and honest hearts, who
are true Christians in whom is
no guile. For wee must note
that as the whole Law of God
(...) as the Apostle
speakes, is summarily comprised
in the word Loue, Loue to
our neighbour, including all the
the dutyes of the second table,
and loue to God the duties of
both, though more immediatly
those of the first, euen so our
loue vnto Christ compriseth all
the duties, all the respect and
homage which wee owe vnto
him and his Gospell.

It is not my purpose to dismember
my text by the vntoward
curiosity of a diuision: I
haue not as yet learned that
piece of methode. The reasons
inducing mee to the choyce of
this Scripture arose from a serious
consideration of the spirituall
estate of these times. Wee
liue in an age of most peremptory
presumption, and we may
obserue that our presumption
of the end is vpheld by our presumption
of the meanes.^n this age ^uery one ^resumes (...) shall be ^^ued onely ^ecause he ^hinkes himselfe to ^e a Chri^tian and ^ne that ^oues Christ. No
man but thinkes hee shall bee
saued, and why? because euery
man thinkes himselfe to bee a
Christian, to bee one that loues
Christ, which to speake more
rationally is but our presumption;
for it is no presumption
for a man to belieue that hee
shall bee saued vnlesse hee bee
vnassured of this supposition
that hee is a Christian. In a
word, whereas there is a twofold

grace of God: his promising
and rewarding grace, and
then his qualifying or sanctifying
grace, we presume vpon
that because wee presume
vpon this, wee make full account
of his mercies and promises,
because wee make no
question of those holy qualifications
in our selues which dispose
vs to belieue in him and
to loue him. Now then seeing
wee all suppose that the euerlasting
fauours of God doe most
vnfallibly appertaine vnto all
and none but such as loue Christ
Iesus, 2. that our selues are all
such, the first supposall beeing
cleere out of my text, all our
care must bee for the second,
to see that we are not mistaken
in our account of our selues.
The triall of all, lies in this sincerity,
whether we are indeed
those men in respect of Christ

which wee verily thinke our
selues to bee. That therefore I
may acquaint you both with
the necessity and methode of
this triall, that I might shew
you both what need wee haue
to examine the sincerity of our
loue vnto Christ and Christianity,
and after what manner we
ought to goe about, that if it
may please the opener and turner
of hearts to effect any thing
by so contemptible an instrument,
I may awake some one
out of that pleasant, but deadly
slumber which possesseth thousands
in this land, and cause
him to looke better to his standing.
The diuision is into three most considerable points of our loue vnto Christ. I haue resolued by the assistance
of the spirit at seuerall
opportunities to discourse vnto
you of three generall heads, or
most considerable points in our
loue vnto Christ; 1. the ground
or foundation of our loue vnto

Christ; the reasons wherefore
wee are Christians. 2. the degree
or intention of our loue
vnto Christ; how much wee
ought to loue him, or in what
pitch of resolution to resigne
our selues vnto him. 3. the
effects and operations of our
loue vnto him, or the speciall
fruites of our sincerity. In my
discourse of the ground of our
loue vnto Christ I haue proposed
vnto my selfe this methode
1. I will discouer two deceiuable
insufficie^t grounds which
at this day betray thousands vnto
perdition, causing them to
fall short of those glorious
hopes which were built vpon
them. 2. I will lay open the
true ground and proper originall
from whence all sincere affection
vnto Christ ariseth. The
first of those deceiuable grou^ds,
is custome, the discouering of

which will take vp as much
time as your patience will bee
willing to allow me at once.
The fall of man hath not so
farre worne out of his heart the
impressions of a Deity, and the
engrafted notions of religion,
but that we all bring into the
world with vs those restlesse
instincts, and importunate impulsions
which will not suffer
vs to bee at quiet vntill we are
initiated into some Religion or
other, The Ancient Epicures
though it were the scope of
their damned profession to bee
altogether irreligious, and the
most contenting perfectio^ they
could proiect vnto themselues,
yet as wee may perceiue by
such writings as they haue left
vs they could neuer fully attaine
vnto it,The very Epicures felt often the gripes of conscience. but in spight of
their affected Atheisme they
were forced to betray many

shrewd grudgings and terrible
gripes of naturall conscience.
And though in the deniall of
diuine prouidence vpon the
supposall of which depends all
religion, they put a good face
vpon it, and seeme to laugh at
the matter, yet wee may perceiue
they were still gawled
with that formido oppositi and
by those engraued principles
were euer and anon stung to
reall feare of that truth which
they would faine haue mocked
out of the world either as an
ancient inuention of policy to
keepe men in awe, or as an inueterate
slauery of vulgar ignorance.
The same inbred seedes
of religion by which it pleaseth
God to force a manifestation of
himselfe euen vpon those who
would faine haue no notice of
him, and in the most reprobate
mindes to make Atheisme rather

a wish then an opinion, after
so many successions of ages
are no whit decayed, but continue
still as stirring and actiue
in the hearts of men as euer
they were since they receiued
that vnhappy crush by the first
transgression. For the Creator
of all things as the Psalmist tells
vs Psal. 33. 15. fashioneth the
hearts of all men alike, the
word is (...), which signifyes
together at once, intimating
that the hearts of all men
though separated from one another
by neuer so vast a gulfe of
time or place,The necessity of a Religion. are as exactly alike
in respect of their originall
inclinations, as if they had
beene all moulded at the same
time.According to the custom of the country so is our worship. The worship of a God
then, some kinde of religion is
necessary vnto vs, wee cannot
shift it of: but now the propensions
of nature being blind and

confused, and there being a various
multiplicity of religions
in the world, here ordinarily
step in the lawes and customes
of the countrey, into which the
wombe of nature first empties
vs, which shape our generall
inclinations either to worship
the true God, or this or that Idoll,
and the true God after
this or that manner. Looke abroad
into the world and obserue
the swarmes of diuers and
contrary religions which either
fill places apart by themselues
or are promiseuously exercised
amongst one another, and
you shall perceiue them to bee
nothing but the naturall instincts
of religion in generall,
specificated into diuerse formes
and fashions by birth and education.
For albeit there may
bee many occasions of, and difficulties
in the first bringing in

of a religion into a countrey,
yet after it hath once by countenance
from supreme authoritie
and other plausibilities insinuated
it selfe into the acceptance
and approbation of the
multitude, it thenceforth becomes
(...) to vse St
Peters word, and with an easie
descent runnes downe the
streame of succession, being
deliuered from Father to Son
as naturally, as the proper language,
manner of diet, fashion
of apparell, or any other customes
of the countrey.
Now amongst so many religions
as in severall parts of the
world are by custome conveyed
and passed from one to another
wee suppose there is but
one which wee may dare to
trust for our happinesse,There is but one true religion by the which true happinesse is attained. but
one that can certainely doe our
soules that good which most of

them would seem to promise.What true Religion is.
Neither will wee seeme to
doubt but that this one sauing
religion is that which consists
in the knowledge of the only
true God, and whom hee hath
sent Iesus Christ, and therefore
we will all seeme to bee
much in loue with this heave^ly
profession before any other
whatsoeuer. If then wee will
be sure not to cosen our selues
in these perswasions, not to over-reckon
our selues in our
loue vnto Christ and his Gospell,
here is a maine businesse
for vs, punctually to enquire
how we came by this loue and
liking vnto Christ, vpon what
motiue wee haue preferred
this profession of Christ before
such a multitude of Religions
in the world.The motiues or reasons of our embracing of Christianity before all other Religions. You know
that no art or invention can
force waters to mount aboue

their spring head: in like
manner, it's impossible that
our affections vnto Christ
should be more elevated, more
heauenly and spirituall then
the originall from whence
they streame. If then being
put to it by our selues or others
we can think of no better reasons
for our choice of Christianity
then such as these because
we had the fortune to be born
in a place where Christ onely
was talked of, because we haue
heard Turkes, Iewes, and Papists
much spoken against, and
were ever told that this is the
best religion, because the King
and Lawes haue banished all
other Sects, and haue established
this profession of Christ
which we haue alwaies beene
brought vp in, and could never
see any harme in it, if such sottish,
senslesse stuffe bee the best

defence wee can make for our
selues, it appeares too plainely
that our religio^ is nothing but
those common reliques of naturall
instincts which I spoke
of before* christned, as it were
by humane lawes and customes,
and that we are Christians upon
no waightier inducements,
then wee might haue beene
Pagans or Idolaters. I tremble
to speak it; if an Indian should
bee demanded why hee worshipped
the Divell, changing
only the circumstances hee
might giue as sufficient reasons
as these for his most fearefull
and horrible Idolatry. But
this example though it might
square but too well to my purpose
is too odious to be insisted
vpon. Aske a common Iew
why he blaspheames our blessed
Saviour, why hee expects
another Messias, a Turke why

he is circumcised, why he is so
devoted to Mahomet, they
wil both in effect giue the very
same reasons of their blaspheamies
and superstitions,
which a common ignorant
Christian will giue why hee is
rather a Christian then a Iew
or a Turke, justifie their damned
hatred and detestation of
Christ, by the same arguments,
which cause him to professe
speciall loue and service vnto
him. Nay you will say there
is no Christian so barbarously
ignorant but he may say more
for himselfe then any of those
vnbeleeuing misereants can,
he hath heard the holy Scriptures
read, beene made partakers
of the blessed Sacraments
he hopes to haue his sinnes forgiuen
him by Christ, and though
hee bee not able to proue it by
formall argumentation, hee

knowes well enough that
Turkes and all such as speake
against Christ are accursed infidells.
I thinke indeed there
are not many Christians but
may say so much and perhaps
more, by wrote, and taking it
vp vpon trust, but this is quite
besides the purpose. For I doe
not now question the Christian
in the duties or opinions of
his religion, but I cal vpon him
for his speciall reasons which
cause him to performe those
duties, or embrace those opinions.
He hath beene partaker
of the blessed Sacraments, but
what better reason can hee
giue why these Sacraments
can doe his soule good: then a
Turke may, why his circumcision
should be beneficial vnto
him; hee hath heard the
Scriptures read and expounded,
but what better reason

can he giue, why he supposeth
the Scriptures to be the word
of God, then the Turke will,
why he is so confident that the
Alcoran came downe immediatly
from heaven, in that
laylatto-Hanz^li,(...) as they call
it, the night of demission; Lastly,
he stifly conceits himselfe
to be one of the only true faith
and all Turkes to be abhorred
infidels, but what peculiar evidences
hath hee that the
Turkes are mistaken and not
himselfe, seeing they are as co^fident
on the other side that
Christians are Cafirouna,(...) Infidels,
as they tearme vs, and that
themselues are the onely Moslimina
or Musulmans (that
is) right beleeuers?(...) If then
the Christians being pressed
with these demands can produce
nothing from any supernaturall
alteration which hee

hath felt wrought in himselfe,
if he be not able from spirituall
selfe experience of that
cutting convincing power of
the Scriptures, and of those
admirable vertues and comfortable
influences of the Sacraments,
if he be yet altogether
vnacquainted with those caelestiall
flashes, irradiations and
inward testimonies of the spirit,
which vse to put all these
things out of questio^ in soules
truly Christianiz'd. Lastly', if
for want of better Apologie
he be forced to retire to those
poore, dishonourable, impertinent,
To plead custome and law of the countrey is rather an excuse then a reason of ones religion. rather excuses then reasons
of his religion, taken form
the lawes and customes of his
countrey, it is too too manifest
that hee adheres vnto Christ
vpon no better motiue then
others blaspheame and persecute
him, and even spit at the
motion of his name.

But here some may put in;Obiect:
howsoever such a Christian
may be out-braved, yet that
which he saies and thinkes is
true: he is in the right though
he cannot demonstrate like a
Scholler how he came to it, and
therefore hee is sure howsoever
men may prate, to speed
well enough.
No such matter,Answere. it is a very
disputable case, whether such
a one as liues and dies a Christian
vpon custome, or a Turke
be in the grosser error. This
may seeme very harsh,Little difference betwixt a Christian and a Turke, if the former be so only vpon custome. but you
may easily espie the truth of it
if you please to remember,
that both the assent of our vnderstandings,
and choice of our
wills may bee misguided into
errour two waies: either by
assenting vnto, and approving
that as true and good which in

it selfe is false and evill, or
by assenting vnto, or appro^ing
that which is both true
and good in it selfe, vpon
weake, incoherent, insufficient
inducementes, I cannot
stand to comment vpon
this distinction, and it is so triviall
that I conceaue it need
not much to bee exemplified.
Applied vnto my purpose it
cleerely shewes the ignorant
Christian not to bee a whit
more in the right then the
Turk* The obiect of his assent
and loue is most right absolutly
in it selfe because it is not
an object vnto him for that
truth and goodnesse by which
it's distinguished from all other
objects, but for those co^mon
corrupt grounds, which
abstractly considered, equally
encline the soule to any object,
as well to the grossest errors

as the purest truth, to the
extreamest evil, as to the chiefest
good. So that this comparison
is like to light most heavily
vpon the Christian, seeing
the goodnesse of the object
will not excuse or justifie, but
rather shame and condemne
him, who professing much
loue vnto it, passeth by that
which alone was louely in it.
For the present indeed the
Christians case is infinitely the
better,The Christians case is the better, only by reason of the opportunities of correcting his errour. because hee may with
more ease correct his errour,
and hath all requisite opportunities
to that purpose, but if he
neglect to doe it hereafter, the
Turke will get the better of
him, whe^ at the day of judgement,
he that hath died such a
Christian, will bee glad to
change places with him. In
the meane time, there is not
any difference in their errors

discernable to reason, for this
is certaine, that diversity of
objects cannot put any difference
in the assents, where the
grounds are exactly the same,
yea if some of the acutest moderne
disputers haue rightly
determined, that the assent
vnto the premises, and the co^clusion
is but one and the same
assent, being originally to
those, and terminatiuely to
this, I can scarce allow the
difference to be so great. For
then it skills not how false or
true the conclusio^ be absolutly
in it selfe, but how strongly
or weakly it's inferred
out of it's premises, and therefore
though one conclude an
infallible truth, and another a
monstrous falshood out of the
same faulty premises, the errour
of both is the same, if they
assent vnto their conclusions

vpon no other medium then
this insufficie^t one,The ignorant Christians assent vnto the Gospell, and the Turkes to the Alcoran, proceed both vpon the same grounds. vpo^ which
they both agree. For example,
the principle vpon which the
ignorant Christians assent vnto
the Gospell stands, is this:
That Religion which my Parents
haue taught mee, my Soveraigne
commanded me, and
the common cry of my country
approued is surely the best.
The Turke changing only the
appropriating circumstances,
supposeth likewise, that religion
which his Sul^an, Parents
and Countrey men haue commended
vnto him to bee questionlesse
the best. Both then
proceed vpon the same medium,
and therefore though by
the intervention of other casualties,
the Turke bee cast vpon
execrable blasphemies and impieties,
and the Christian vpon
heavenly and holy truths, their

error is directly the same,
though more fortunate in one
then in the other. And howsoever
such a Christia^ hath his
assent and imaginary loue by lot
of his birth and education, actually
fixed vpon sauing truths
yet vntil he bethinke himselfe
of more proper and solid reasons
for his choice, he retaines
still in his breast habitually and
implicitly the seeds of all those
hellish impostures, which by
other men, in other places,
haue beene entertained and
swallowed vpon the same occasions.
Suppose a Christian,
who can make no better defence
for his profession then
such a one as I haue laboured
to make him ashamed of, immediatly
after his birth in
England had beene conveyed
into Turkie, and there insteed
of Baptisme circumcised after

the Turkish manner, and there
so cunningly trained vp in the
Turkish superstition, that hee
had no occasion giuen him to
suspect himselfe not to haue
beene borne a Turke: no question
but he would haue bene as
zealous there for the rascall
Mahomet: as now being bred
in England, he is for the blessed
Lord of the world. And no
marvel, for the very same occurrences
which haue made
him a christia^ here, must needs
haue made him a Mahometan
at Constantinople, seeing that
whatsoeuer arguments drawn
from lawes, customes, birth, educatio^,
pleade here for Christ
would there perswade as effectually
for Mahomet, Neither
speake I this as if this would
argue any notorious imperfection
in the man: for doubtles
this would be any mans case:

Suppose any of those renowned
Champions of Christ who^
Queene Mary sent to heauen
in fiery Chariots, had beene
nursed and brought vp amo^gst
the Saracens, vnlesse God had
vouchsafed them a miracle for
their conversion, we cannot imagine
but they would haue
beene Saracens. Suppose the
deuoutest Saint of God at this
day breathing had beene trained
vp at the feet of some
Iewish Rabbin if we looke no
higher then ordinary meanes,
we must needs conceaue that
with the hellish mallice of a
Iew he would haue defied that
blessed Sauiour of his, whom
now he worships day and night.
I mentioned not that therefore
to shew the weakenesse
of the person, but of such reasons
of his Christianity, as changing
only the scene of his nativity

and education, might haue
made him hotter against it the^
now he is for it. So that the only
fundamentall reason why
such a Christian is rather a
Christian then a Iew, Turk, or
Idolater, is because Christianity
bespoke him as soone as hee
came into the world, and permitted
not those madde superstitions
either to speake with
him at all or not till it selfe had
prevented them and gotten
possessio^. For we may obserue
that albeit generally in the
world errour keepes truth out
of the soules of men by anticipation,
A formall Christian is a Christian by educatio^ only, and the custome of his country
damming vp all the
passages by which shee should
enter with base preconceipts
and odious prejudices, yet in
some corners where divine
providence hath been pleased
to allow truth an authorised,
setled residency, it gets the

start of errour, and prevailes as
much by prepossession here as
errour doth in other places,
beating that away with the
same clamours and out-cries
by which it selfe is elsewhere
baffled. But this to speake
more punctually is not a fight
betweene truth and errour
though by the vndiscerning
vulgar it be mistaken for it, but
a kinde of blindfold combate
betweene prejudice and prejudice,
or of custome against
custome. For in these cases
though truth blocke vp errors
way, and so keepe that from
stealing into the soule, yet doth
not she presently enter in her
selfe, but stands, as it were, before
the dore displaying her
resplendent rarities and admirable
perfections, and if for
their sakes alone shee bee not
earnestly invited to come in

and importun'd to take vp her
lodging there, she vouchsafeth
not to enter but at last flings away
in disdain. Men may imagine
shee is gone in because
they cannot heare or see heresie
or superstition stirring with
in, but for certaine sauing truth
never presseth into any soule
vpon the bare adva^tage of being
the first commer, but for
her owne singular worth shee
lookes to be wooed, importuned,
and with some violence
haled in, as the blessedst guest
that could possibly haue come
first or last.
But here may some demand,
if the summe of all this that
hath beene spoken bee true, to
wit,The benefit of our birth and education amongst Christians. That our loue vnto Christ
and his Gospell be not gotten
by our birth and education amongst
Christians, what benefit
is it to bee borne within the

visible Church? What prerogatiue
to bee bred in the light
of the Gospell? I answere,
that it's an advantage of inestimable
value, for which we all
owe more thanks and praises
vnto the Lord then our shallow
braines and narrow hearts
can possibly conceaue. But we
must wisely consider the proper
end and vse for which it
hath pleased the Father of
lights to afford vs this blessed
priviledge, which is not that
it should bee a cause, but a
meanes, not a ground but an
occasion of our loue vnto his
beloued Sonne. In our commo^
friendship we can easily distinguish
betweene the contingent
occasions of our acquaintance
with a man, and the immediate
reasons of our affectionate
loue vnto him: those are
accidentally offered fro^ without,

these are some speciall excellencies
apprehended by vs
to bee inherent in the person
we affect, those are but meanes
to bring vs to the knowledge
of these. Even so in our spirituall
loue vnto Christ Iesus
blessed for ever, the Lord hath
gratiously planted vs within
the sound of the Gospell, given
vs education in Christian
rites and fashions, and provided
vs the testimony of the
Church to tell vs that there is
such a Saviour come into the
world, and to bring vs joyfull
newes what vnvaluable treasures
of mercy and glory hee
hath brought with him to enrich
all such as shall come vnto
him, pinched with the sense
of their spirituall poverty;
Those are the meanes appointed
to giue vs notice of these,
but these onely must bee the

grounds of our affection vnto
him.
To conclude this discourse,
albeit our loue vnto Christ be
gotten by our naturall birth and
education, be nothing worth in
it selfe, yet is it the ordinary
rode which leades vs to the
sight and sense of those transcendent
perfections in him
which will ravish vs with a
more transce^dent loue of him:
Happy are we if that base vulgar
loue be in time swallowed
vp in a loue more celestiall
and divine, if that which can
doe our soules no good while
we rest vpon it become a manuduction
vnto that which
will certainely make vs blessed.
Had not the Samaritans
beleeued at first vpon an insufficient
ground, the alarum
of the woman, they had not
come to beleeue vpo^ the true,

their owne knowledge and experience.
Had not the faithful
soule, which is now most sicke
of a spirituall loue vnto her Saviour,
first loued him vpon
heare-say and custome, she had
never felt, in all probability,
those heavenly trances and vnvtterable
ravishments with
which now she is transported.
All that loue which wee professe
vnto Christ betweene our
first birth, and the first pangs of
the second, is a loue arising only
from nature and custome, and
is tolerable in vs while wee
are children, being not so properly
an errour as an introduction
vnto truth: I say it's a
hopefull preparation in children
which are not yet come
to that ripenesse of their naturall
faculties that the ordinary
means of grace, the preaching
of the Gospell, may worke vpon

on them. But after they haue
attained to maturity of reason
and should beginne to haue
(...), as the Apostle
speakes, their senses exercised
to discerne betweene
good and evill, if they proceed
still in such childish conceits
of Christ Iesus, and drowsie affections
vnto him, as they sucked
from their nurses breasts,
their loue beginnes now to be
grossely sinfull, and whensoever
it shall please the Lord to
thunder them out of that sleep
of death, wherein now they
enjoy some co^tenting dreames
they must penitently bewaile
it amongst the other sinnes of
their vnregeneracy.
I haue done with my discovery
of the false ground of
loue vnto Christ, by naturall
instincts of religion, restrained
to Christianity by birth and education.

Before I proceed to
an application of this discourse,
I will insist vpon some opposite
places of holy Scripture,
which will adde both light and
strength vnto the precedent
discourse, and I hope prepare
your hearts to the ensuing application.
And first wee haue
an excellent place, Cant. 5. v. 9
where the Spouse, that is the
faithfull soule hath this interrogatory
doubled vnto her,
what is thy beloued more then a
beloued; (...) mahdodek
middod, what is thy beloved
more then a beloued, that is,
what transcendencies, what
singularities of alluring perfections,
are so peculiarly remarkable
in that Saviour of them,
on whom thou art so strangely
enamoured, as if there were
nothing louely besides him?
But what hath the soule nothing

now to commend in her
Saviour, but what might bee
paraleld in some other? Yea,
from that verse to the end of
the Chapter, shee runnes on
in a description of his rarities;
a description so stuffed with
the choicest delicacies of expression,
that I am perswaded
it cannot be matched out of any
of those Poets which haue
flowen highest in amorous inventions;
I cannot stand to
vnfold them vnto you: that
which makes most to my purpose
in it, is the superlatiue
preeminence which shee
giues him, v. 10. Hee is the
chiefest, or as it is more elegantly
in the originall, Hee is
an ensigne bearer amongst ten
thousand, for so the word (...)
Dagull, properly signifies,
v. 16. He is altogether louely;
(...) cullo machamaddim,

he is all entire, he is all
composed of loues, wherevpo^
she co^cludes with a triu^phant
Epiphonema, This is my beloved,
and this is my friend, o yee
daughters of Ierusalem.Phil. 1. v. 9. 10. A second
memorable place is Phil.
1. v. 9. 10. S. Paul speakes
thus, And this I pray that your
loue, (to wit, to Christ and his
Gospell) may abound yet more
and more in knowledge, and in
all iudgement, that you may approue
things that are excellent.
that yee may bee syncere and
without offence, till the day of
Christ. The Apostle praying
for the confirmation of their
loue vnto the Gospell, and as
an especiall meanes of that he
praies, they may abound in all
judgement, by which they
may bee able vpon good
grounds to approue the reall
excellencies of truth before

the plausibilities of errour,
that so they may be syncere in
their loue vnto it, to which
purpose also he praies for the
Ephesians, that they may bee
rooted and grounded in loue,
Ephes. 3. 17. A third cousiderable
place is,1. Cor. 12. 3. 1. Cor. 12. 3.
Wherefore I giue you to vnderstand,
that no man speaking
by the spirit of God calleth Jesus
accursed: and that no man
can say that Iesus is the Lord
but by the Holy Ghost, that is,
no man can with the fiduciall
assent of his heart, acknowledge
Christ to bee the only
Lord, which he is to worship
by the same impulsions, by
which another curses and blaspheames
him, but by such peculiar
motiues as are suggested
and revealed vnto him by the
Holy Ghost.
There is no man in this assembly

but would thinke it
very strange, if one should tell
him seriously, he could not say,
no not so much as thinke, that
Iesus is the Lord. But if hee
thinke and say him to be Anathema,
his saying will doe
him no good, though he make
it his only worke to reveale it
as long as hee liues. The last
place shall bee that eminent
one in S. Peter, 1. 3. 15. But
sanctify the Lord in your
hearts, and bee ready alwaies
to giue an answere to every man
that asketh you a reason of the
hope that is in you, What reason?
Such a one as may bee retorted
by those who question
vs? Such a one as may perhaps
make more against vs then for
vs? Such a generall one as
might bee giuen for any presumption
in the world? No*
a reason from a cleere distinct

knowledge of the peculiar
grounds, and experimentall
sense of those encouraging
foretasts of our incorruptible
hopes by the Gospell: which
though it cannot convince
such Hereticks and Infidells
as examine vs, because the
God of this world hath closed
their eyes, yet it may strengthen
vs to possesse our soules
in patience, and to hold fast our
confidence which hath such
great recompences of reward
in spight of all the terrours of
Men or Divels.
Vse. 1.Vse 1. Is to examine your selues vvhether ye be come out of this customary loue vnto Christ, into a spirituall, or no. To admonish every
man here present with all
speed and diligence to commune
with his owne heart, and
to examine whether he bee as
yet come out of his customary
loue vnto Christ into a spirituall,
or no. Beloued, we are all
confident that we loue Christ

Iesus, and if one should in earnest
tell vs wee did not loue
him, we should take it as ill,
and interpret it as if he told vs
wee were damned. Seeing
then all our glorious hopes of
a better life are built vpon
this supposition: that wee are
the true disciples of Christ, as
wee would not be called to
after-reckonings at that solemne
day of accounts, or haue
a flaw found in our evidence,
which should eternally dash
our expectation, even then
when wee should take possession,
as wee would not haue
our hopes to vanish in amazement,
and confusion at that
terrible day, when it shall bee
too late to recall or rectify any
thing which hath beene
formerly amisse, as wee would
not haue our confident conceipts
of Christs loue vnto vs,

and ours vnto him giue vs the
s^ippe at the houre of death,
when wee should haue most
vse of them, and leaue vs to
a fearefull expectation of
judgement. Let vs, I say, if
wee haue any regard of sense
of these things deale ingenuously
with our owne soules,
and impartially examine what
better ground wee haue for
that supposition which vpholds
all our well fare, then
such as I haue demonstrated to
bee miserably insufficient.
Christians we are all by education,
by country and custome,
by conformity vnto lawes and
fashions: but is this all? haue
wee proceeded no farther?
why this will advantage vs
no more for heauen then that
wee are Englishmen. All this
is but the outside of Christianity.
Christianity thrust vpon

vs by our naturall birth before
wee were aware of it, and setled
on faster by custome, and
as it were rivited in while we
perhaps never thought of it.
What saith the Apostle 2.
Romans, 28. Hee is not a
Iew which is one (...)
in that which appeares
outwardly. What not he a Iew
which is borne and bred a
Iew? yea hee is a Iew in
all outward visible respects
whatsoever. But all these will
giue him no title to those everlasting
promises which are
made vnto Abraham and his
seed according to the faith. He
is no Iew in respect of them.
In like manner he is no Christian,
who is but outwardly
one: who slides insensibly to
himselfe into the visible garbe
of Christianity; by naturall
generation. He only is a Iew,
who is one (...) in the

secrets of his heart, and he only
is a Christian, who hath bin
made one by a second birth of
his soule, invisible to others;
but admirably sensible vnto
himselfe, being borne not of
bloud, nor of the will of the
flesh, nor of the will of man,
but of God, as S. Iohn fully expresseth
it, c. 1. v. 13 Well the^,
if thou wouldst not be mistaken
in thy selfe, if thou
wouldst be ascertained whither
or no thou lou'st Christianity
vpon any other motiues
then such as nature and custome
may suggest. First of all
looke backe vpon the estate of
thy soule ever since thou hast
beene able to rememeber. Reflecting
thus vpon so much of
thy life as is gone, canst thou
not remember a time wherein
thy selfe being judge, thou
didst but dissemble with thy

Saviour, when thou thoughtst
of him but very seldome, and
then but perfunctorily, without
any heat of affections,
when thou tookest not much
to heart any thing hee hath
done for thee, when thou
tookest no conscionable care
to liue vnto him, because hee
had died for thee. Reflecting
thus vpon thee time past, canst
thou not discerne but that thy
loue vnto Christ hath beene
spun out in an even thread
even from the cradle vntill
now, but that the pulse of thy
affections vnto him hath alwaies
beaten much after the
same manner, without any notable
variation. In a word
can'st thou not remember but
that thou hast loued him alwaies
as well, if not better,
then thou hast in the latter
time of thy life past. I say if

the case be thus with thee, its
a thousand to one but thou louest
him only vpon that deceivable
ground which I haue laboured
to discover.
To direct a little farther in
this examination. Suppose the
winde which now sits in thy
backe, and kindly blowes thee
on towards Christ, should
turne vpon a sudden and furiously
bluster in thy face. Suppose
those lawes and customes
which hitherto haue encouraged
thee to proceed in Christianity,
The backe sliding of others cannot seduce the sound Christian. should command thee
backe againe, and tell thee
they were mistaken: suppose
all the men thou knowest or
hearest of, should change the
fashion of their religion, and
leaue thee as much alone, as
Elias once thought himselfe
to haue beene: and holy Athanasius
was when hee held

vp against a world of Arrians;
I say if the (...)
that speciall excellency of the
knowledge of Christ, which
made S. Paul to count all
things dung, that hee might
winne Christ, hath not furnished
thee with vnanswerable
reasons, why these supposalls
should not pull thee backe, its
a plaine case, that only the opposite
encouragements set
thee forward. To bee briefe,
art thou not sure that thou hast
such speciall peculiar reasons
for thy religion as could not
haue suffered it, much lesse
haue caused thee vpon any
supposalls to haue beene of any
other. Hast thou not with an
inlightned vnderstanding espied
in Christ Iesus those
vn paralel'd transcendencies
which put an insinitely vast
difference betweene him and

those many Antichrists in the
world. Lastly, hast thou not at
some time or other, in some
measure had thy conscience
convicted of sinne, revived
with such gracious influences
distilling from his louely cou^tenance,
and refreshed with
such words of eternall life
from him, as thou knowest
(goe whether thou wilt)
cannot be expected from any
one else. If thy heart answere
no to these interrogatories, assure
thy selfe thou knowest
not yet what this meanes to
loue Christ, I should but flatter
thee to tell thee thou art a
Christian, yea I should in some
sort mocke thee, by giuing
thee a glorious title, which if
thou continue as thou art, will
no way benefit thee, yea it
will not only keepe thee out
of heaven, but sinke thee deeper

into Hell. Giue glory vnto
God that thou liuest in a
time and place where thou
hast all encouragements, opportunities,
invitations to bee
more entirely acquainted
with thy Saviour, and to grow
as intimate with him, as any
man else, but for the present
be content to consider that thy
loue of him hitherto hath bin
built vpon a rotten foundation;
giue no rest vnto thy selfe,
vntill thou hast learned to loue
thy Saviour vpon such inducements
as he would haue thee,
even because hee hath loued
thee. Giue not over importuning
the spirit of grace to direct
thy heart into the loue of God,
and into the patient waiting
for Christ, as the Apostle divinely
prayes for the Thess. 2.
Ep. 3. 5. Giue not over I say,
vntill thou hast attained vnto

all riches of the full assurance of
vnderstanding to the acknowledgement
of the mystery of
God, and of the Father, and of
Christ, as the same Apostle
sweetly prayes for the Colossians
2. 2.
Vse 2. Let me bespeake all
such,Vse 2. th^^ those that are made partakers of the heavenly calling take two things to heart. as by the tender mercies
of God melting their hearts,
haue beene made partakers of
the heauenly calling, and begotten
againe vnto a liuely
hope, let me I say, if there be,
any consolation in Christ,1. The infinite dishonour that is done vnto Christ by the customary profession of his glorious name and Gospell. if any
fellowship of the Spirit, if
any bowels and mercies, let
me beseech them to take two
things deepely to heart. First,
the infinite dishonour which
is done vnto Christ, the author
and finisher of our faith by the
customary profession of his
glorious name and Gospell in
this kingdome. It's aboue

three score yeares since the
Saviour of the world hath
vouchsafed after a most especiall
manner to reside amongst
vs early and late, to call and
cry vnto vs, to take notice
what need we haue of him, to
bethinke our selues of our infinite
wants, which none but
hee can suppl, counselling vs
as he did the Church of Laodicea
to buy of him gold tried
in the fire that wee may bee
rich, and white raiment that
our nakednesse might not appeare
an eye salue, that now
in this our daies wee might
see those things which belong
vnto our peace, and all this
without mony: now that after
all this there should be thousands
amongst vs, who being
asked a reason of the hope that
is in them, cannot speake tolerable
sense why they are

Christians rather then professed
Infidels; that there should
be whole parishes which cannot
afford one wise word toward
the defence of our most
holy profession, that many
who will take it very ill, if
they are not accounted as good
Christians as the best, should
thinke no otherwise of Christ,
then some doe of S. Patricke,
and S. David, and other of the
Saints of their country. Lastly,
that those great and pretious
promises which Christ hath
purchased for vs, with the vnvaluable
price of his owne
dearest blood, by those who
one day thinke to haue their
share in them, that they set as
slothfull, ignorant, heartles
affections vpon them, as professed
infidells doe vpon those
poore imaginary, deluding
hopes which Satan is permitted

to abuse them with, questionlesse
it becomes not any
man, who hath resolued the
rest of his time in the flesh, to
seeke the things of Christ Iesus,
and hath felt in his owne
soule what good reason hee
hath for it, I say it becomes
not any such to thinke of these
things which grate so mercilesly
vpon his Saviours
wounds, and even make them
bleed a fresh, without sighs
and groanes, a bleeding heart,
and a great deale of secret
mourning. Betweene the millions
of men who hate the redeemer
of the world, and the
multitude which loue him
they know not wherefore,2 To commiserate the lamentable condition of their poore ignorant ^ethren. O
how few are there which loue
him in syncerity! The second
thing which I would intreat
of those who vnderstand what
a wofull thing it is to bee a

stranger vnto Christ, to be yet
vnreconciled vnto God by
him, is that they would with
yerning bowels commiserate
the lamentable condition of
their poore ignorant brethren
which they shall meet with
every where, especially in
most country Villages.
I haue obserued vpon occasions
much table merriment
which hath beene made by
tales which passe about of such
absurd, senselesse answers as
silly Christians haue given, being
demanded a reason of their
faith, perhaps vpon their
death-beds or at their comming
to the Lords table. Let
such vnnaturall mirth be farre
from those who are to striue to
haue the same minde in them,
which was in Christ Iesus.
You, who by the blessed
change wrought in your

soules, haue passed from death
vnto life, consider with a
thankefull reflexion vpon the
Father of lights, that had not
he vouchsafed you a more ingenuous
education, fairer opportunities
to grow acquainted
with the mysteries of
grace, more distinct call of his
fanctifying spirit, and more
illuminated apprehensions to
discerne them, you might haue
groped and stumbled in a
thicker mist of stupidity then
now befooles your vnnurturd
brethren, you might haue dishonoured
that blessed name
by which you are called, by as
wild misco^^^its and horrid
follies, as any come from
them, and whatsoever is ridiculous
in them might haue bin
more prodigoius in you, you
know what price to set vpon
your owne soules. You know

the soule of the meanest idiot
is of equall value with yours,
and that it cost the redeemer
of the World as many stripes
and wounds as yours, O then
pitty thy brethren so likely to
perish, for whom Christ died,
yea the rather, because they
being stuffed with sottish conceipts,
will be ready to laugh
at those who shall pitty them:
Take all opportunities to doe
them some spirituall good as
occasion shall be offered, conferring
with them and praying
for them: and let Christian
sympathies bee the least you
can afford them; you know
what you meane, when you
pray daily that Gods kingdome
may come; remember,
you pray not in earnest, vnlesse
you doe your faithfull endenuour
to helpe it forward, as
in your owne hearts, so in the

hearts of your brethren,
with which at any time you
converse. Consider I beseech
you, what, a dismall fogge of
Popery doth yet darken this
Iland, Popery which few
thinkes of, I meane that blind
absurd implicite faith of beleeuing,
as the Church beleeues.
For there is not a pin
to choose betweene him that
beleeues in grosse, what the
Church of England beleeues,
and him that beleeues as that
synagogue of Satan the
Church of Rome beleeues, it
neither knowes any thing explicitly,
what either Church
beleeues. Meditate on this,
and what zeale, what conrage,
what indignation you feele in
your breasts against the Antichristian
impostures of Rome,
let them fly I beseech you vpon
all occasions, against this

Protestant Popery. But I see
no hope but that the Colliars
faith will haue the greatest
number of professors, whilst
accurate Catechizing of all
sorts of people, which did so
much good in the primitiue
Church, is in ours so generally
neglected. But I conclude,
bespeaking you in the words
of S. Iude, But yee beloued,
building vp your selues on your
most holy faith, praying in the
holy Ghost. Keepe your selues
in the loue of God, looking for
the mercies of our Lord Iesus
Christ vnto eternall life. And
of some haue compassion making
a difference. And others saue
with feare, pulling them out of
the fire: hating even the garment
spotted by the flesh.
O thou father of mercies
and God of all consolations,
looke downe from thy throne

of eternity, and take notice of
vs thy poore servants, who
doe now desire to muster vp
all the faculties which thou
hast given vs, and to employ
the^ in an acceptable thankesgiuing
vnto thee. O Lord wee
desire to spend our best spirits
even to exhale our dearest
soules in thankefull ejaculations
vnto thee, for that most
incomprehensibly admirable
contrivance of our salvation,
by the death of the sonne of
thy loue: O Lord we desire to
be transported with a holy amazement,
as often as wee
thinke of this mystery of mysteries,
and even to empty our
hearts of their secrets in halleluiahs,
and voices of exultation.
Most holy Lord, wee
praise thee, for the marvelous
light of thy Gospell, which
hath acquainsed vs with those

wonders of mercy, which thy
Christ hath performed for our
soules, for those comfortable
evidences of our justification
by him, with which our bruised
consciences haue beene
most gratiously revived. Wee
praise thee likewise for those
wounders of a new creation
which thy blessed spirit hath
begunne in our hearts, for that
it hath begunne to weaken
and wast the body of sinne, to
crucify those corruptio^s which
heretofore hath beene most
insolent in vs, to weane vs fro^
those vanities, which heretofore
haue beene our chiefe
comforts, and to make vs more
willing to bee kept within a
holy compasse. O Lord we desire,
wee desire with most enlarged
hearts, to blesse thy infinite
goodnesse, for all those
ravishing irradiations and glorious

Prefaces of our blessed
immortality, by which thy co^forting
spirit hath so often encouraged
vs to patient continuance
in well doing. Wee
blesse thee for all the heavenly
thoughts, affections, desires, and
resolutions which thou hast
put into vs at any time, wee
praise thee for that portiou of
thy good word which thou
hast afforded vs at this time, O
thou that delightest to pardon
abundantly, pardon all the errours
and imperfections which
haue come either from me in
delivering, or any of thy people
in entertaining thy message.
Let it not bee a savour of
death vnto death, vnto any ma^
who hath beene within the
sound of it, but let it some way
or other bee beneficiall vnto
him in respect of thy kingdome.
And now oh thou that

dwellest in vnapprochable
splendor, quite out of the ken
of mortality, seeing thou hast
suffered dust and ashes to approch
so neere to thee in thy
ordinances, dismisse not any
one of vs, wee beseech thee,
without a blessing, send not any
one of vs without a comfortable
beame of thy countenance
shining into his heart;
Thou art the fountaine of holinesse,
send vs not therefore
out of thy presence without
some more cleerenesse in our
apprehensions of thy saving
mysteries, and heavenlinesse
in our affections vnto them.
Send vs not from thy throne
of grace but with a heavenly
calme in our soules, or with
such tempests of repentance as
may prepare vs for an everlasting
serenity, O Lord send vs
not away but either with that

joy which passeth all vnderstanding,
or that godly sorrow
which may prepare vs for it.
To thee O Father with thy beloued
Sonne and blessed Spirit,
three most glorious Persons, and
one infinite Deity, be ascribed
all Honour, Power, Praise,
Might, Majestie, and Dominion,
by vs poore sinners here
militant on earth, and all the
glorified companies triumphant
in Heaven, from this
time forth for evermore.
Amen, Amen.
FINIS.



THE
TRIALL OF
our sincere loue
to Christ.

EPHES. 6. V. 24.
Grace be with al them that loue
our Lord Iesus Christ in sincerity.

I WIL not discourage
your
attentio^ with
a tedious repotition of
what I haue
heretofore in another audience
deliuered vpon this Scripture,

something must needs
be recalled to guid your attention
into the ensuing discourse
and to knit that vnto a former:
but I wil not trouble you with
a word more, then the necessity
of methode shall enforce
me vnto. To winde vp then
as much as is necessary in a
breife introduction.
We liue in an age of a Presumption
as peremptory as vniversall:
they are rare men
that make any question of their
salvation, and which is most to
be pitied, they are for the most
part such as haue least reason. I
am perswaded, there was never
yet any time when men
were generally more confident
in their hope of heaven,
or lesse able to giue a wise reason
for it; insomuch, that it
may be but too probably conjectured,
that to one that perishes

through dispaire, there
miscarry hundreds through
presumption.
This generall presumption
stands vpon these two general
suppositions. 1. That Grace,
that is, all the gracious, precious
promises of God concerning
a better life, doe infallibly
appertaine to all such as
loue Christ Iesus in sincerity:
that is, to all such as are true,
serious, resolute Christians.
2. That wee our selues are all
such men, that we are all Christians
good enough to serue
the turne, though wee are not
so forward and exemplary,
though we keepe not such stir
with our profession as some others
doe. The first suppositio^
is out of all question, and can
never bee brought into disputation
by those which submit
to the Scriptures, it being the

scope, not only of my Text, but
also of the whole Gospell, ye a
of the Law and the Prophets.
So that (with reverence bee it
spoken) it shall bee as possible
for God, that is the eternall
truth it selfe to lye, as for that
supposition to fayle any man,
who observing the conditions
of it, casts himselfe vpon it: so
that in strict propriety of
speech, it is not of it selfe any
prop of presumption, but only
by accident as it's subject to
mis-application by vs. Well
then, presumption stands more
directly, and leanes more heavily
vpon the second supposition,
and therefore all our care
must bee every man for himselfe,
to see that wee are not
mistaken in our account at
home, to bee sure wee are all
such men as wee deeme our
selues to be, that is, such Christians,

as may vpon good sufficient
grounds, lay clayme vnto,
and plead interest in all the
glorious promises in Christ Iesus.
Vpon this I observed all
the conditions required on our
part, and by consequent, the
whole tryall of our assurance,
to be comprised in this sincerity
of our loue towards him;
and farther, for the exact triall,
and through examination of
this, I imposed vpon my selfe
the handling of three most co^siderable
points which make
vp it selfe, and evidence vnto
vs the sincerity of our loue vnto
Christ. 1. The true immediate
ground, or originall of it.
2. The requisite degree or intension
of it. 3. The especiall
fruits and effects of it.
Concerning the originall
of our loue vnto Christ, amo^gst

many insufficient deceauable
grounds of it, I vndertooke the
discovery of one which I fou^d
to be most dangerous and vniversall:
to wit, natural instincts
of religion in generall restrained
to Christianity by birth and
education. This discovery, I
haue already elsewhere at
large, as God enabled me, performed.
In the second place,
I promised a declaratio^ of the
true, proper, and sure ground
of sincere loue vnto Christ: and
this by the assistance of the
blessed spirit, you shall haue
paid at this time.
Well then, what is the most
immediate and proper ground
of the sincere loue of a poore
sinner vnto his Saviour Iesus
Christ? I answere out of the
question, when in earnest hee
finds himselfe to bee a miserable
sinner, and apprehends

Christ Iesus to be his gracious
Saviour, and one of whom hee
stands in infinite need. Or to
to deliuer it more fully, it is a
cleare,The grou^d of a Christians loue to Christ. distinct, particular, tender
apprehension of his owne
infinite wants and miseries by
reason of sinne, and of those miracles
of loue and mercy which
Christ hath performed to cure
these and supply those, and that
as freely and purposely for him,
as for any man elfe.
To cleare and confirme this
excellent point I will, as God
hath directed my meditations.
1 First proue it to be so.
2 And then demonstrate
why it is so.
That it is so, appeares by sundry
places of holy Scripture,
out of which I will cull some
few, which seeme to me most
pregnant and pertinent. First,
I loue the Lord, saith holy David,

Psalm. 116. 1. marke his
reason; because hee hath heard
my voice and my supplications.
But what kinde of supplications
were these? vpon what occasion
were they made? you
may see both, v. 3, 4. The sorrowes
of death compassed me about,
and the paines of hell gate
hold vpon me: then called I vpon
the name of the Lord, O
Lord I beseech thee deliver my
soule. These were my supplications,
which the Lord hath
heard, and therefore I loue him,
yea, because he hath inclined his
care vnto me in these my spirituall
agonies, I will call vpon
him as long as I liue. 2. we haue
an eminent place, 1. Ioh. ^. 19.
We loue him, marke his reason,
because he first loued vs. True,
some may say, God hath loaded
vs with innumerable expressions
of his loue in our

creation and preservation, and
we doe reciprocally loue him
for them: but what's this to
the loue of Christ? To omit as
impertinent to this place, that
in some sort we owe both our
creation and temporall preservatio^
vnto Gods loue in Christ;
seeing it is not probable, but
the whole frame of nature
should haue beene dissolued
presently vpon the fal, had not
God of his mercy intended a
Redeemer for mankinde to be
revealed in the fulnesse of
time: but to let this passe, S.
Iohn in these words, because he
first loued vs, vnderstands that
loue of loues, that boundlesse,
incomprehensible loue of God
wherewith hee hath loued vs
in Christ: as it plainly appeares
by comparing 9. and 10. veries.
In this (that is) in this infinitely
more, then in any mercy of

creation or preservation, was
manifested the loue of God
towards vs, because that God
sent his onely begotten sonne
into the world, that we might
liue through him. Herein is loue
(that is) herein infinitly more
then in any thing else, not that
we loued God, but that he loued
vs, and sent his sonne to bee the
propitiation for our sinnes. To
recollect, and to bring it home
to the point in hand, when as
the fame S. Iohn speakes v. 16.
Wee haue knowne and beleeued
the loue that God hath to vs,
when we find our selues to have
been eeven dead men, and that
God sent his Son, that we might
live through him; when wee
perceaue our selues overloden
with sinnes, and that Christ
was sent purposely to be a propitiation
for them; O here is
the true originall of our loue

vnto him, now wee loue him,
because hee first loued vs. A
third place, and I'le trouble you
with no more, is Luc. 7. 37.
where we haue a whole parable
to this purpose, deliuered
by our Saviour himselfe to
make the Pharisees vnderstand
what that poore woma^ meant
by those strange distracted and
seemingly madde expressions
of her loue vnto him in washing
his feet with teares, and
wiping them with her haire,
etc. The parable is of a Creditor
and his two debtors; I need
not repeat it, most of you
knowe it already, others may
pervse it if they please. The
application of it is, that then
sinners doe indeed fall in loue
with their Saviour when they
perceaue themselues to bee over
head and eares, as wee say
in debt vnto God, and themselues

most vnable to discharge
one farthing, whe^ they
feele that God begins to put
his bond in suite which they
had forfeited long before they
were borne, when he sends an
arrest for them by the terrours
of his Law, their owne consciences,
and the spirit of bondage.
Lastly, when they feele themselues
even haled towards
that prison from which never
any man came out, which was
once in, and then most opportunely
comes in Christ Iesus
with his merits, satisfies his father
to the full, rescues them
out of the sergeants hands, that
they being deliuered out of
the hands of their enimies may
serue him without feare, in
holinesse and righteousnesse
before him all the daies of
their life. Indeed the conclusion
of the application vers.

4*7. seemes to thwart and vnsay
all that which I haue said.
Her sinnes which are many are
forgiuen her, because shee loued
much. I deny not but the
words as they are, admit a pious
sense, neither am I ignorant
with how little adoe
they may be reconciled which
haue beene hitherto spoken.
But if I might bee worthy
to deliuer mine own opinion,
with due respect vnto the
translaters, I would alter one
word in the translation, which
I suspect should runne thus:The ordinary translation corrected.
Her sinnes which are many are
forgiuen, therfore shee hath loved
much. The sense requires
this construction. 1. Because
the whole scope of the parable
is to shew that hee loues
most to whom most is forgiue^,
and not contrarily, that most
is forgiuen to him that loues

mo^t. 2. The antithesis in the
same verse requires it, the
words, but to whom little is
forgiuen he loueth little, supposeth
this thesis; because many
sinnes are forgiuen her shee
soueth much. Now as the sense
requires this inter pretation, so
the conjunction (...) admits it:
for albeit not in the pure
Greek idiom, yet in the Helenisticke
vse of it, answers to
all the acceptions of the Hebrew
(...) which hath sometimes
the signification of ideo,
quapropter, etc. Neither may
it prejudice this interpretation,
that our Saviour after all
those expressions of loue from
the penitent woman, and his
apologie for himselfe and her
to the Pharisee, tells her that
her sinnes are forgiuen her:
this was but that sentence of
absolution for her greater co^fort,

and assurance outwardly
pronou^ced, of which no doubt
but she had before some gratious
inklings within, and the
vertue of which she had already
tasted, though not in that
comfortable measure, or distinct
manner as she desired.
But now I would not willingly
be mistaken in the point
as if my opinion were, or I intended
to proue out of the afore-cited
places, that there is
no true loue vnto Christ, but
what is grounded vpon an actual
perswasion of the remission
of our sinnes by him. Alas
how many poore soules euen
languish with a spirituall thirst
after him! how many bleeding
hearts both feele and expresse
most vehement pangs
of importunate loue towards
him: how many broken spirits
euen spend and exhale themselues

in continuall sallyes as it
were, and egressions of affection
vnto him, who haue indeed
heard, but not as yet tasted
how gratious he is, who haue
not as yet perceaued in themselues
those inward whisperings
of comfort, Feare not, I
am thy salvation: bee of good
cheere thy sinnes bee forgiuen
thee: in a word, who haue not
as yet felt themselues sealed to
the day of redemption by that
holy spirit of promise?
To rescue the truth out of
these clouds, and to present it
in her brightnesse vnto you,
we must first obserue that every
degree of true spirituall
loue vnto Christ, proceeds fro^
a proportionable act of sauing
faith: Secondly, that there is a
twofold loue, 1. One of desire,
which is an earnest longing
after that, which wee beleeue

would doe vs much good if
wee could attaine vnto it.
2. Another of complacencie,
when hauing attained that we
desire, we hugge, and embrace
it, and solace our selues in the
fruition of it. Now as ordinarily
in the loue of any other
object: so likewise if wee respect
Christ, Iesus, the first of
these loues is the introduction
to the second; and both of the^
issue from a proportionable
act of faith precedent. That
affectionate longing and thirstie
loue wherewith we pant
and gaspe after Christ having
never yet been refreshed with
any comfortable testimony of
the spirit since the beginning
of our humiliation, proceeds
from that former act of faith
whereby we assent vnto al the
Gospell promises as most true
and good in themselues, and

infinitely better vnto vs then
any thing in the world could
we bee once assured that they
belong vnto vs as well as to
other men. That other loue of
complaconcie, when with the
Psal: we returne vnto our rest,
because the Lord hath dealt
bountifully with vs, and sweetly
repose our selues in the lap
of our Saviour, with content
vnspeakable and full of glory,
proceeds from that last act of
faith, whereby we are actually
perswaded by those welcome
whispers of the spirit of
adoption, that Christ is as certainly
our Saviour as any mans
else, and that our debts (as infinite
as they were) are cancelled
to a f^rthing, as well as
the smaller summes of others.
Lastly, it will not be amisse
to obserue two things of this
loue of complacency arising

from a perswasion of Christs
loue vnto vs in particular.
1. It's subject to all variations
or changes, ebbings and flowings
of that perswasion. For as
often as in any violent temptation,
or sensible disertion our
perswasion seemes to be confuted,
this loue of complacencie
is either for a time quite
stupified, or else it falls back as
it were into that thirsty auxious
loue of desire. 2. This loue
of complacencie admits degrees
proportionably to the
degrees of that perswasion. If
that be cleare and strong, this
loue is more cheerefull and pleasant:
if that be weake and obscure,
this loue is not so spright
full,Faith may be sincere though mixed with Anxiety. but somewhat lumpish
being cold with many feares,
and jealousies. Whence this
loue of complacency may not
vnfitly be subdivided. 1. Into

Ordinary loue which proceeds
from a weaker degree
of that last act of faith, and
though sincere, yet being imperfect,
is mixed with anxiety
in the same proportion as that
is with doubting. And 2. into
Heroicall loue which springeth
from a more eminent and
transcendent pitch of perswasion
concerning our owne reconciliation
in particular: this
is that perfect loue, which S.
Iohn saies, casteth out all feare
(to wit) of distruste, bringing
vs into a more intimate familiarity
with God. I call the
first Ordinary, because most
Christians though effectually
called doe ordinarily feele but
such a timorous loue in themselues.
The second which I
call Heroicall in that sense in
which eminent vertues haue
their Epithite, is constantly only

in such as either beside the
evidence of the word and spirit,
haue had some speciall revelation
to put them out of all
doubt concerning their estate
to Godward, on such as by a
constant close walking with
God,Constancy in a Christian course frequent tasts of Christs loue, and the Testimony of the spirit assure vs of our Salvation. haue beene long exercised
in a Christian course,
haue often entertained Christ
Iesus at supper in their hearts,
and habituated themselues into
a more familiar acquaintance,
with that holy spirit
which brings all the good
news from heauen to those diligent
soules which carefully
wait for it.
Thus haue I according to
the skill that is giuen mee,
proued the originall of the
syncere loue of a sinner vnto
Christ Iesus blessed for ever,
to be a serious tender apprehension
of his own extreame

need of Christ, and of Christs
superabundant loue vnto him:
I haue likewise explained this
truth, and vindicated it from
such exceptions as crossed my
way. I come now to discouer
the demonstratiue reason of
this truth, and after I haue
shewed that it is so, to shew
you now why it must be so.
Wee are all borne into the
world (...),The second part of the text. haters of God,
and while wee continue in
that naturall stupid condition,
wherein we were borne, wee
are all strangers both vnto God
and Christ,There is not imprinted in our nature so much as the obscurest intimation of a Saviour or the necessity of one. yea, enemies in our
mindes through wicked workes,
as the Apostle speakes. Col. 1.
21. We retaine indeed some
obscure cloudy notions of a
God, but not the darkest intimations
of a Saviour, or least
suspition of any need we haue
of one. In a word albeit wee

are borne and bred within the
shrillest sound of the Gospell,
yet as long as we continue (...)
meere animall, naturall
men, it will not sinke into our
heads, that we are in such miserable
case as Preachers
would make vs beleeue wee
are, how ill its like to goe with
vs vnlesse we laboriously enquire
after Christ, and get to
be reconciled vnto God by
him. Now what more effectuall
method can we imagine to
beate vs out of this naturall
antipathy against our Creatour
and Redeemer, yea what other
contrivance may there be
to worke such peeuish wretches,
such froward rebels out
of one extreame into another,
out of deadly hatred to sincere
loue of the eternall Father and
his only Sonne, to pull downe
their proud stomackes, to

make them crouch and craule
vnto his throne of grace, then
to make them see in what a
hell they are while they stand
in this distance from him to awake
their consciences against
them, and to make them
a terrour vnto themselues to
let the Law thunder and lighten
into their soules vntill
their wits and spirits beginne
to faile them, and then amidst
all these amazing tempests to
let the glorious Gospell of
Christ shine vpon them,The curses of the law driue vs to Christ. to
shew them Christ Iesus with
his armes of mercy stretched
out, and vndertaking to free
them out of all these confusions,
and to make their peace
with his father if they will but
come vnto him, and trust their
selues with him, if they will
but lay to heart, and learne to
esteeme and admire those wonders

of redemption which he
hath compassed for them. Had
the prodigall sonnes stocke
held out, and hee lyen still afloate
in the full-tide of his sinfull
pleasures, hee had set vp
his staffe in that fa^^e country,
and quite forgot that hee ever
had a father: yea when the
tide was gone and had left
him vpon the sands: when the
revells were ended, his bravery
quite worne out into beggery,
and himselfe preferred
to be an attendant of a company
of hogs, if he could but haue
got his belly full of huskes, he
would hardly haue thought of
returning home: but when
these were denyed him, and
hee could see nothing but
death before him, O now hee
comes to himselfe, and begins
to thinke of a father hee had,
and resolues to goe vnto him,

though he might well suspect
his entertainment. Well,
whatsoever that may proue,
he is sure hee goes to a father,
and therefore on he goes, and
when hee, was yet a farre off,
full of aboding feares, and disconsolate
mu^ings, behold his
father about his necke before
he was a ware of him, acting
an over-joyned man, hee hangs
about him and kisses him,
trims him vp with a robe and
a ring, conducts him home in
a kinde of triumph, and welcomes
him with the solemnity
of a feast and musicke! Here
was a change for the prodigall
enough to haue turned his
braines as we say, but sure it
could not but turne his heart.
Had that beene of marble or
adamant, this could not but
melt it into loue. O what a
swelling, a thronging, a wrastling

did hee now feele in his
bowels of tendrest passions,
impatient for want of expression.
O how did he now lay about
him with teares of sorrow
and teares of joy, being
much pulled, whether it
would best become to prosecute
his joy most or his sorrow:
in briefe how mad is hee
with himselfe that hee had
beene such a sonne to such a
Father!
I haue insisted the longer
vpon the prodigals case, because
indeed it is our owne.
For ordinarily; our heavenly
father vseth the same method
to fetch vs his prodigall children
home vnto him, and to
bring vs in loue with his beloued
sonne Iesus Christ. We
are all as soone as we are born,
gotten into a farre country,
where we mispend, and misemploy

all those faculties and
endowments, with which our
Creator hath furnished vs, in
the revels of sinne and vanity,
walking on merrily and confidently
(...)
as the Apostle speakes
Ephes. 2. 2. according to the
course of this world: professing
indeed (for fashion sake) loue
both vnto God and Christ, but
all the while denying and disclaiming
them both in our
hearts and conversations. But
God who is rich in mercy for his
great loue wherewith hee hath
loued vs. Ephes. 2. 4. when hee
hath let vs runne our selues
even out of breath in these
riotous courses, and even tyred
our selues in our journey
to hell, thinkes it sit to stop
our progresse, and first to make
vs vnderstand our selues, that
we may the better esteeme of

him and whom hee hath sent
Iesus Christ. First then hee inspires
vs with so much spirituall
life, as may make vs feele
our spirituall burden, consisting
of our sinnes, and his curses
due vnto them; hee raises
vp many affrightments, and
grim apparitions in our consciences,
he giues Satan leaue
to insult over vs, whatsoever
outward contentment we fasten
on, to put vs out of these
dumpes, he beates vs off from
it, he leaues vs not huskes to
feed on, he driues vs out of one
shift into another, til at last we
are driven out of all, and so
farre, that wee see plainely,
there is but one way with vs,
even to perish everlastingly,
vnlesse we can get to bee reconciled
vnto him. Now wee
begin to come to our selues,
and perceiuing our onely

course which we haue left,Gods justice must be satisfied ere we can obtaine his mercy. to
bee, to cast our selues vpon
Gods mercy, but no getting
neare vnto that, vnlesse his
justice be first satisfied, no possibility
of that on our parts, vnlesse
we can get the satisfaction
of Christ imputed vnto vs,
finding the Scriptures so peremptory,
that there is no comming
to the Father, but by the
Sonne, that hee that hath the
Sonne hath life, but he that hath
not the Sonne, hath not life, but
the wrath of God abideth on
him. Ioh. 3. 30. O now wee
begin to see it was to some
purpose, that wee haue heard
Preacher so talke so much of
Christ; now wee beginne to
hearken better after him, to
value and admire him; now
wee wonder how wee could
endure to bee without him so
long, that we could thinke so

slightly of him heretofore,
now those holy fits of loue
grow vpon vs apace, and vpon
a suddaine, with the Spouse
in the Canticles, wee are sicke
of loue. Now are wee entred
into the loue of desire, and
while our poore soules are
sweating in these restlesse passions,
wee heare at length
Christ Iesus in a milde still
voice, inviting all such as are
weary and heavy laden to come
vnto him, that hee may giue
them rest: vpon this wee addresse
our selues towards him,
with our burden vpon our
shoulder, and when wee are
got within kenne of him, hee
seemes sometimes to goe
backward from vs, to make
vs more eager after him, and
thus oft-times he lets vs stand
trembling and shaking, weeping
and groaning vnder our

burdens, till wee are even
sinking and swovvning vnder
them, and then hee conveyes
them away, cleares vp the
heavens over vs, speakes like
a husband vnto our soules by
his Spirit, he presents vs vnto
his Father, who now smiles
vpon vs with a reconciled
countenance, and then vnto
his Angels who amongst all
their Halleluiahs, receiue
some addition vnto their triumphant
mirth by our conversion.
Now no man need tell
vs what Christ hath done for
vs, we feele reall experiments
of all in our owne hearts,There are Reall tasts of the benefits procured by Christ in the hearts of true beleeuers. now
wee haue seene, and felt, and
tasted how infinitely he hath
loued vs, we are ready to make
our boast of it, and with the
Psalmist, to invite all such as
feare God purposely that wee
may declare vnto them what

hee hath done for our soules.
Now we are in that loue of
complacency, now wee cling
vnto him, and would faine
come out of our selues, to
creepe vnto him, affecting not
only a vnion, but vnity with
him, now wee bestirre our
selues in all the holy complements
of heavenly loue, never
thinking wee haue done enough,
frequently bathing our
selues in those delicious intimacies
of our spirituall marriage.
which how much they
passe all vnderstanding, I appeale
to their experiences; to
whom these things are no Paradoxes.
You see the excellent contrivance,
by which our stubborne
rebellious hearts are
wrought over vnto the sincere
loue of Iesus Christ: I suppose
it now expedient to cleare

this discourse of the originall
of vnfained loue, from some
doubts and scruples which
may arise from it.
1 Whether none can loue
Christ in sincerity, but those
that are brought vnto it by
this method? I answere not
one ordinarily, if his conversion
bee wrought by the Ministery
of the Word.The sense of our owne misery makes vs in loue with Christ as a Saviour. The reason
is plaine out of what hath bin
deliuered. Wee are to loue
Christ as a Saviour: how can
we be brought to those, vntill
we feele our selues lost, and
vndersta^d what need we haue
of a Saviour? Wee are to loue
him as a Mediatour: what reason
is there for this, vnlesse we
first plainely perceiue God
to be our enimy? Lastly, wee
are to loue him as our Physitian:
what sense is there for that
if wee feele not our selues in

some dangers, if wee feele no
aches or gripings, no smart about
our soules, if we finde no
good that Christ hath done vs,
or can doe vs? Himselfe tells
vs, the whole haue no need of
the Physitian; onely the sicke,
such as feele and acknowledge
themselues to be sicke, will
make vse of him. But here it's
requisite to obserue, that the
severall passages of this great
alteration wrought in our affections,
are more or lesse sensible,
according to the severall
conditions of the persons. We
are all prodigalls, yet some
more, some lesse: we are all
gone into a farre countrey, yet
some roue a great deale farther
then others: For illustration,
some haue had a more restraining
education then others
and beene trained vp in
a more innocent civility, vntill

the time of their visitation,
which oft-times overtakes
them very early, and takes
them in before they are acquainted
with the villaines of
the world, or vices of the
times: such, though commonly
they take weeping crosse in
their way too, as they come
home vnto Christ, yet they
passe not through so many
pikes, so many panges, and
terrors but with lesse stirre and
diffficulty arriue safely at his
bosome, and get within his
embraces. On the other side,
some are starke prodigalls,
meere Publicans such as haue
taken their full swinge in the
wildest exorbitancies, such as
haue served an apprentiship,
perhaps two or three to the
World, the Flesh, and the Divell,
such as these, when it
pleaseth God to put his hooke

in their nostrils, to turne them
round, and make them looke
towards heauen, are brought
to the loue of Christ, even
steppe by steppe in that method
which I haue formerly
described. The other are
brought vnto the loue of
Christ, but these being once
brought vnto it, loue him
more vehemently, for it's certaine
he loues most to whom
most is forgiuen.
2 Doubt,Whether our loue to Christ would not be more exact if we did consider the brightnesse of his glory. Whether our
loue vnto Christ would not
be more pure and acceptable
vnto him, if it arose from an
exact, steddy contemplation
of those infinitely amiable excellencies,
and transcendent
beauties, which are resplendent
in his person; he being the
brightnesse of glory, and the expresse
image of his Father, Heb.
1. 3. or as it is ver. 7. 26. The

brightnesse of the everlasting
light, the vnspotted mirror of
the power of God, and the
image of his goodnesse.
I answere by proposing
three briefe considerations:Christ only considered as a Saviour moues vs to loue him.
1. That is the truest loue of
Christ, which beats vs out of
our naturall enmity against
him, and brings vs home with
longing affections vnto him.
Now it's most true, that the
person of Christ, absolutely
considered without the relation
of a Saviour vnto vs, is invested
with most attractiue
excellencies, and ravishing
beauties: but if a glimpse of
that orient lustre should flash
in the face of an vnregenerate
ma^, or impenitent sinner, vnlesse
the sanctifying spirit
should at the same instant renew
his heart, it might driue
him out of his wits but not

out of his sinnes, it might terrify
him into a desperate
transe, but not advance him to
a kindly extasie.
Likewise if one should goe
about to winne an enimy of
grace vnto the loue of Christ,
by the most accurate Metaphysicall
discourses of those
infinitely superlatiue beauties
in the Deity absolutely considered,
either they would bee
phantasticke riddles vnto
him, or at leastwise prevaile
no more with him to that
purpose, then it would perswade
him to loue one dearely,
whom he mortally hated,
to tell him that hee was a
comely Gentleman. 2. Suppose
these mysticall contemplations
were effectuall this
way, yet he that is yet vnacquainted
with the power of
converting grace, is altogether

vndisposed to set himselfe
about them. An acute,
but vnsanctified schoole man
may overstraine his vnderstanding
with a wearisome
gaze vpon those invisible
beauties,Subtlety without the grace of conversion will not kindle the loue of Christ in our hearts. and dazle it into a
more distempered ignorance,
but not in to such a ravishment
of loue, as may warme and
elevate his affections whereas
the penitent soule, which
by the grace of conversion,
hath felt those sacred coniugall
affections already kindled
in it selfe, may advantage her
selfe excellently by such contemplations,
by her intellectuall
all aspirings and affaires, as it
were to see him that is invisible,
and by refreshing her
selfe with sweetest meditations
of those inconceivable
glories which are aboue,
where Christ sits at the right

hand of God. So that such contemplations,
though they
cannot ordinarily begin sincere
loue vnto Christ in our
hearts, yet they may keepe it
vp, blowe it into a purer
flame, and advance it to a degree
of Angelicall sublimity.
3. That loue of Christ is most
sincere and acceptable vnto
him, which giues him most
glory of that which he desires
most to be glorified in: that is,
of his goodnesse,Our loue to Christ must bee practicall. his attributes,
and workes of mercy in our
Salvation. Hee requires not an
ayrie, but a fierie loue. He respects
not so much that speculatiue
loue, which consists in a
simple amaze of the vnderstanding,
or bare admiration
of those vndiscovered perfections
of his nature, which
haue not as yet done vs any
good, though one day the sight

of them shall be a part of our
blessednesse. Christ requires
that loue of vs, whereby wee
confesse our selues beholding
vnto him, that loue which laies
vs flat before him, and whereby
we acknowledge we owe
our selues vnto him. I may
much admire and applaud a
man of excellent parts, for his
rare endowments, and yet
thinke my selfe no more beholding
vnto him, then hee is
to me, yea I may beare grudges
against him in my mind,
and be farre from any affectionate
loue towards him: Even
so with some Schoolemen,
and writers of mysticall theologie
I may busy my braine,
and set my minde a staring vpon
that absolute Ideaa of vndefiled
beauty in the Deity, and
yet as long as I continue vnsensible
of what Christ hath

done for my redemption, retaine
a frozen and a flinty
heart.
If we loue Christ only because
hee hath loued vs, it
seemes that in our loue vnto
him, we haue a chiefe eye vnto
our selues, and that we loue
our selues more then him,
which ordinarily cannot bee
pleasing vnto him, or any way
stand with sincerity.The occasion of our loue to Ch. is our own salvation, the end his glory. For answere,
wee must distinguish
betweene the impulsiue and
the finall cause of our loue vnto
Christ, or in termes somewhat
plainer, betweene the
first inward occasion of it, and
the maine scope of it. My care
of my owne soule originally
driues me to harken after a Saviour,
and when I haue found
him, and finde withall, that
he hath bought me out of my
selfe, that I am not my owne,

as it is, 1. Cor. 6. 19. hence
forth the maine scope and principall
aime of my loue vnto
him is to doe that for which
chiefely I was created and redeemed,
to let goe all interest
the loue of Christ constraineth
vs, saith St Paul: why so? Because
wee thus iudge, that if
one died for all, then were all
dead: here is that originall of

our loue implied which I haue
so largely insisted vpon, it followeth,
and he died for all, that
they which henceforth liue,
should not liue vnto themselues,
but vnto him that died for
them, and rose againe. This is
the end of Christs loue vnto
vs, and must bee the businesse
and maine drist of our loue vnto
him. So that our loue vnto
Christ, arising from a tender
apprehension of his loue vnto
vs, is not mercenary, but
makes most for his honour,
seeing that if he had not prevented
vs, we should in some
sort haue stood vpon equall
tearmes with him. Lastly, it is
his good pleasure, that wee
should loue that most which
is best for vs, that in which
most consists our perfection, if
therefore wee loue him as our
perfection, conceauing our

selues to bee worse then nothing
without him if wee remoue
our selues, as it were,
into him, and according to that
sweet phrase of the Apostle,
hide our liues with him in God:
Though all this while implicitly
we loue our selues, yet
wee need not doubt of our sincerity,
this is the very loue
which hee requires. St Paules
loue vnto him was such as
this. Gal. 2. 20. I liue, yet not I,
but Christ in me, and the life
which I now liue in the flesh, I
liue by the faith of the Sonne of
God: marke the reason, and first
the inducement to all this,
who hath loued mee, and giuen
himselfe for mee. It's time by
your patience to come to some
application.
1 For examination, to perswade
every man that would
not cozen himselfe in his perswasions
concerning his spirituall

estate, speedily, and impartially
to examine the loue
hee supposes hee beares to
Christ Iesus by what we haue
amply discoursed concerning
the true and proper Originall
of it. Thou pretendst most entyre
loue vnto Christ Iesus,
whom thou callest thy Saviour,
thou wouldst spit in his
face, that should make any serious
question of it, thou art
confident that thou dost not
dissemble with him. Well the^,
vpon this supposall giue mee
leaue to sound thy sincerity
with these interrogatories.
Dost thou remember a time
when thou hadst not that loue
in thy breast which now thou
reckonest vpon for sound and
currant, though thou canst not
precisely tell when thou got'st
it? Canst thou tell vpon what
occasions, or gesse at the manner

how thou at ashedst it?
Wert thou brought vnto it by
that methode which I haue
discoured,Interrogatories to (...) our sincerity. or at least by one
somewhat like it? If thy conscience
can now answer these
proposals affirmatiuely, why
then I hope thou maist picke a
great deale of sound comfort
out of the precedent discourse
which will testifie vnto thee
that thou louest Christ vpon a
true ground, and that therefore,
that grace and favour of
God with all the blessings issuing
from it, appertaines vnto
thee, which the Apostle
wishes to all those which loue
Christ Jesus in sincerity. But
on the contrary, if thy conscience
start at these demands, and
beginne to fumble at them,
making as if it did not vnderstand
them, if they driue thee
to confesse, that thou knowest

no such matter by thy selfe;
why then my discourse will
conclude thy pretended loue
vnto Christ, to be but a meere
fancie, and thy selfe for the
present to bee but an vnhappy
man. To goe yet more particularly
to work in this examination
according to the methode
aboue proposed. Hast
thou beene experimentally
convinced in thy owne soule
in what desperate case thou
art by nature? Hast thou clearly
perceaued to be true in thy
selfe whatsoeuer the Scriptures
tell thee of the monstrous
pronenesse of mans
heart to any evill^, and vntowardnesse
to any good? Hast
thou beene made to possesse
the sinnes of thy youth, as holy
Iob was? and haue the terrors
of God stared thy guilty conscience
in the face, and affrighted

it almost into a bloody
sweat, and then hath there appeared
as it were an Angell
comforting thee? Hast thou
felt thy selfe a condemned
man, and even going to execution,
and hath Christ Iesus in
the nick stept in with thy pardon
both purchased and sealed
with his owne most pretious
blood? If thou hast felt either
these passages, or some which
may serue proportionably insteed
of them, to bee the canse
of that which thou professest
vnto Christ, I dare not questio^
the synceritie of it, least with
those, Ezech. 13. I wound that
soule which should not dye, and
make the heart of him sad, who^
the Lord hath not made sad. I
should wrong thee exceedingly
not to beleeue that Christ is
him whom thy soule loueth, and
that with S. Pauls constraining

loue, a loue as strong as death,
which many waters ca^not que^ch
neither shall the stoods drowne
it. Cant. 8. 7. But now on the
co^trary, to conclude negatiuely
from the former interrogatories,
to inferre the want of
sincerity in any man for his not
feeling those passages as they
are verbatim proposed,
would be too rigid, and perhaps
raise a tumult in a well setled
conscience: Onely thus much
Ile say, if all of them sound as
riddles and vncouth mysteries
vnto thee, if thou never knewest
any thing like to what was
proposed by thy selfe, as I
feare many haue not. If thou
knowest not what it meanes
to come heavy laden, poore in
spirit, hungry and thirsty vnto
Christ: why then I wonder
thou shouldst bee so sottish as
to conceaue, or impudent as

to affirme, that thou louest
Christ, if thou wouldst haue vs
vnderstand thee, that thou louest
him in sincerity. I doe
suppose that thou louest him
vpon custome, as thou dost the
fashio^ of thy country in which
thou hast beene borne and bred,
but so does the gretest part of
the world defie him, vpon as
good a ground as that so does
a Turke loue Mahomet, one of
the bafest misereants that ever
was, vpon as substantiall a
ground as that. But we speake
of that transcendent loue of
him, which cannot possibly be
due vnto any one else, and
which would be most due vnto
him, though all the lawes and
customes in the world should
vniversally conspire to crye it
downe, dost thou professe such
a loue vnto him, and knowest
not wherefore? nor vpo^ what

occasion thou wert moued vnto
it? It would vexe a man to
the soule, who knowes indeed
what it is to loue Christ, and
how himselfe was brought vn
to it, to consider the confident
stupidity of multitudes in euery
place who will not be put
out of their dreame, that they
meane as louingly to Christ as
any man, when as indeed they
are not as yet come so far as to
perceaue any proper reason
why they should loue him, or
what reason he hath to expect
any loue from them. I knowe
they will say, they loue him
because he died for them, and
they hope to be saued by him:
Alas these are words of course
and as soone spoken as any other*
they say this, because
they were ever taught to say
so, and never liued among any
that said the contrary* Beloued

it is not the saying of this, or
beleeuing it confusedly like
some old story or tradition wil
melt our congealed hearts into
the loue of Christ:That faith must be experimentall which is the original of sincere loue. No, it
must be through distinct feeling
of it in our owne soules, it
must bee the experience of
this, which makes vs enamoured
on him and sets our hearts
a mounting towards him in
those seraphicall flames of sanctified
affection.
2 The Originall of sincere
loue vnto Christ, being discovered,
and directions giuen
for selfe examination concerning
it,Cautions against Cozening semblance of Loue. a second vse shall bee
for caution against many cozening
semblances of loue vnto
Christ, which may make vs
thinke a great deale better of
our selues then wee haue reason,
which may easily bee discouered
by trying them by

this originall. To instance in
some particulars: There is many
a Ruffian in this kingdome,
who if he should heare a Jew
blaspheaming Christ, his blood
would quickly bee vp; hee
would long to bee doing with
him, and bee hardly kept from
hacking him in peeces. O
what a friend vnto Christ will
such a man suppose himselfe
to be, he will conceipt he hath
behaued himselfe like a Templer,
and done him knights service,
and a hundred to one, but
in this humour, he will call his
companions to come and see the
zeale which he hath for Christ
Jesus. But if there were any
such swaggering Zelot in this
assembly, I would aske him
these questions: Dost thou not
think a hot spirited Turk would
haue fallen as foule vpon the
Iew, if hee had taken him vilifying

his Mahomet? Wouldst
thou: not vndergoe as dangerous
a quarrell to winne the
fauour, or please the humour
of thy mistresse? Would'st
thou not thy selfe, or at least
dost thou not know some who
will quarrell as sternely about
a pipe of Tobacco, or the pledging
of a health? Lastly, hast
thou not suffered thy companions
to blaspheame Christ in
their oathes, perhaps a whole
day together, and thy zeale all
the while hath beene very
well contented with it? You
see by these questions from
what variety of carnall vnsanctified
motiues this seeming
plausible zeale may arise: and
therefore in all such cases, it
much concernes vs, to haue an
eye to the true originall of all
duties of loue, to consider, not
so much what wee doe, as

what makes vs to doe it,Wee must not somuch consider the vehemency of our Affection as the cause of it. and in
a word, to judge of our affections,
not by the heat, but by the
fewell. For a second instance:
Many in reading the history of
our Saviours life, and considering
his sweet, debonnaire and
vnoffensiue carriage, and withall
the contradictio^ of sinners,
the insolencie of proud and
churlish miscreants which he
endured with an vnimitable
patience, will find their hearts
euer and anon rising in indignation
against the Scribes and
Pharisees, and euen tenderly
sympathizing with our Saviour.
These men may presently
imagine themselues to bee
deepely in loue with Christ,
but they may bee miserably
mistaken. Let them consult
with their owne experience,
and obserue, whether they are
not moued to as sensible passions

by the reading of any other
story, though prophane, if
it be any way proportionable
vnto the Evangelicall story for
occurrences: twenty to one
but they will finde it so: There
is not any good story, either sacred
or prophane, but for the
most part it drawes the mind
of the reader, for the time at
least, in to some factio. Wherein
it's evident, that such stirrings
of the affections, may
proceed from a bare historicall
faith, joyned with that commo^
ingenuity of nature,Many passionate positions of our loue to Christ may bee the fruits of a bare Historicall faith ioined with common ingenuity. which
teaches vs to adore the heroicall
vertues of Worthies, long
since deceased, and to commiserate
their vndeserved disasters.
Yea, which is worth observation,
they may proceed
from this common ingenuity,
by the meere working of the
fancie, without any historicall

beleefe at all. Wee finde it by
experie^ce in reading amorous
stories, or histories of strange
adventures, which though we
knowe and beleeue to be fayned,
yet oft times, it handsomly
contriued; they raise more
serious tumults of passions in
our mindes, then the most reall
stories wee can meet with.
Now the reason of it (if my
owne fancy fayle me not) is,
because the imaginatio^, which
hath the same command over
the passions, which the Poets
haue giuen Aeolus ouer the
windes, is it selfe stirr'd vp to
sympathize with all such representations
as are exquisitely
shaped and limb'd according
to it's owne Ideas and inward
contrivances: and in this case,
the imagination poring vpon
the representation it selfe, so
that suite well with it's owne

images within, it regards not
not much, whether it be of an
acted truth, or of a possibility,
forgetting, as it were, for the
present, to distinguish what
might haue beene from what
hath beene. This observation
directs me to a third Instance,
with which I will conclude:
some perhaps may weepe devoutly
at a Passion-Sermon, and
presently imagine their teares
to be distillations of tender affections
vnto Christ; They
may be so, but they may very
easily not be so. Who knowes
not, that the charmes of eloquence
about any sad argume^t,
may easily steale good store of
teares fro^ an auditory of women,
or of soft natur'd men?
Solemne Musicke, a good Pavin
wil doe as much: any liuely
representation of a Tragical
accident, whether reall or imaginary,

will doe as much: amongst
those that can bee so
il busied, as to sit three or foure
houres at a Tragedy, some can
be so wisely, good natur'd too,
as to weepe heartely at it. You
see into what variety of mistakes,
offices of loue vnto
Christ may put vs, while wee
consider them loose by themselues,
and examine them not
by that which ought to be the
fundamentall inducement vnto
them in our hearts, you see
how expedient it is to judge
of these complementall expressio^s
of loue vnto our blessed
Saviour by our hearts, and
not of our hearts by them, and
by co^sequent, you see of what
excellent vse this doctrine of
the ground, or originall of our
loue vnto Christ is, To God the
Father, etc.
FINIS.




LVKE 14. 26.
If any man come to me, and hate
not his Father and Mother,
Wife and Children, and Brethren,
and Sisters; yea and his
owne life also, he cannot hee
my Disciple.

I Proceed still in my
Tract or discourse,
co^cerning the sincerity
of our loue
vnto our blessed Saviour. My
method in it I haue acquainted
you with heretofore, imposing
vpon my selfe a copious
and full handling of three
most co^siderable points, which
both make it vp in itselfe, and
evidence it vnto vs.

1. The true and proper
ground or originall of it: the
speciall reasons inducing vs to
loue him.
2. The requisite, degree and
intention of it: how much we
are to loue him.
3. The especiall effects and
testimonies of it: what we are
to doe because we loue him.
The first of these heads I
haue dispatched already; having
heretofore in another audience
discovered the false, and
in this congregation, the true
grou^ds of our loue vnto Christ
Iesus: I am now falne vpon
the second point, and therein
more punctually to enquire,
how much we are to loue him
which querie our Saviour himselfe
clearely and throughly
resolues in my Text.The occasion of the words. If any ma^
come vnto me, etc.
Our Saviour was now in

the progresse of his humiliation*
going about and doing good.
Being on his way, he obserues
great multitudes thronging and
flocking after him, no doubt
for various ends, and vpon various
motiues. This hee well
knewe: and therevpon that
they might not dishonour him
and deceaue themselues by
grosse, absurd conceipts of a
common easinesse, for any man
to get whatsoever good was
to bee gotten from him by a
little trotting after him, hee
thought it expedient to let the^
all knowe before hand, what
they must of necessitie resolue
vpon, if they would followe
him to any purpose, and solemnly
to forewarne them, what
they must trust vnto if they
made account to get any good
by running after him. If any
man will come to mee (that is)

hoping or desiring to bee better
for mee in regard of a better
life,The expl^^cation of them. and hate not his Father
and Mother, etc. (that is) if he
set not so high a price vpon
his hopes by me, that he bring
this resolution with him to
part with any thing which
may hinder him from doing
mee constant, vniversall service;
yea though it bee that
which otherwise he may most
lawfully and ought most dearly
to affect, hee cannot bee my
Disciple, he is not qualified either
to doe mee that honour
which I shall expect from
him, or to receaue those favours
which hee will expect
from me. If any man desirous
of a more satisfying expectation
of this Scripture shall enquire
yet more particularly, in
what sense the Disciple of
Christ must hate his parents and

children, wife and kindred,
yea and his owne life.
I answer. 1. The law of
God doth not only permit, but
also command vs to loue all
these, and to embrace them
with the sweetest cleerest affections
that nature can possibly
stirre vp in our breasts and bowels:
Farre be it from our Saviour
to contradict this law by
requiring that his Disciples at
their very first entrance into
the schoole, should turne barbarous
and strip themselues
of those sacred, decent affections
of nature and humanity:
that which he requires is this,
that seeing even during the
true Church there will daily
happen many ca^es wherein
wee must needs either deale
vnkindly or dishonourably
with him, or breake squares
with such as are neere and deere

vnto vs, and in time of persecution
we may be so put to it
that we must either bee ashamed
of him before men, and
in the extremity of basenesse
abjure him, or else part with
our temporall life and all contentments;
I say* hee requires,
that his Disciples should come
with mindes so possessed with
an extraordinary overreaching
esteeme of him beyond any
thing else, that they might bee
prepared afore hand for such
exigents, and resolue to runne
the most desperate hazard of
the losse of any mans favour,
or their owne liues, that nothing
may interrupt their obedience
vnto him, or intercept
the light of his countenance
from them. 2. Wee are to
note, that the hatred which is
required, hath not reference to
the persons specified in my

Text, but to such favours and
contentments as wee may receaue
from them. The loue of
Christ will not suffer, much
lesse cause vs, in any case to
neglect the duties, or growe
weary of the relations of nature:
onely thus much Christ
expects from vs seeing wee
may bee often driuen to that
push that we must either loose
him, or the good looks of those
whom wee account* our best
friends, that in comparison of
our hopes by the Gospell, wee
should so hate, (that is) by a
Hebraisme, neglect or disesteeme
whatsoeuer comforts
or favours wee could expect
from them, that without any
long pause or deliberation, we
may bee content to let them
goe, and be glad we are ^o rid
of them, that wee may sticke
close vnto Christ, and be found

in him enwrapped in his righteousnesse.
To vnfold this
yet more distinctly:We may part with what is deare vnto vs for the loue of Christ in ^ respects. wee may
part from that which is deare
vnto vs for the loue of God or
Christ in two respects. 1. As
a sacrifice, to wit, when God
is glorified by that which wee
part with: so Abraham was
willing to part with Isaacke,
and in this respect might bee
said to hate him, though no
doubt but his bowels yearned
most vehemently, even when
his hand was fetching the fatall
blow; so that heroicall
mother 2. Macc. 7. hated her
seaven sonnes whom indeed
she loued most tenderly, being
content to see them all
butchered before her eyes
with horrible rarity of torments,
that they may not disobey
the law, and God might
be glorified. 2. As a temtation,

when wee our selues being
severed from it may glorify
God more freely: Thus
Moses refused to be called the
sonne of Pharaohs daughter,
hating the treasures of Aegypt
in comparison of the reproach
of Christ, Heb. 11. 26. Thus
Ioseph parted with his Mistresse
and all his hopes by his
Master, because he would not
doe that great wickednesse and
sinne against God.The hatred required in Christs disciples is passiue more then actiue. So that indeed
the hatred in my Text is
more passiue then actiue, consisting
in an humble willingnesse
to forgoe any thing
which may bee either an acceptable
sacrifice vnto Christ,
or a dangerous temptation
from him, in a well composed
dislike and disesteeme of those
things, which our nature
counts her jewels, when compared
to those glorious invisible

rarities which they may
hinder vs from. Lastly in a placide,
well tempered contentednesse,
vpon a small warning
to part with them, either
one after another, or all of
them at a clap, so that wee
may be sure of the maine, so
that by letting them goe, wee
may take better hold of Christ
Iesus, in whom we are sure to
finde with an infinite overplus
whatsoever wee loose for his
sake.
My text being thus explained.The Doctrine of the Text.
I will contract the pith
both of it and it's explication
into this doctrine. Whosoever
makes account to bee the
better for his profession of
Christ, and to haue his share in
those vnvaluable purchases
of his passion, must prize
Christ Iesus and his hopes by
him farre beyond whatsoever,

or whomsoever hee may, most
lawfully and ought most dearely
to loue in this world, yea
farre beyond life it selfe, and
whatsoever co^tentments may
endea^e it vnto him. To heape
vp other testimonies or to goe
any farther then my text for
the proofe of this doctrine,
were to prejudice both our
Saviours authority, hee being
so plaine and peremptory in
the point, and your esteeme of
it, as if you were not by his
bare word sufficiently perswaded
and convinced of a
truth, so much concerning
himselfe and you too, if you
doe in earnest desire to haue
any thing to doe with him. My
labour, I suppose will be better
spent in demonstrating vnto
you the equity of that
which may seeme rigour in
this doctrine, in discovering

vnto you what good reasons
our Saviour had to exact so
great a measure and high a
pitch of loue from all those
who would be partakers of his
redemption and sharers of his
merits:The equity of the Doctrine demonstrate^ by two reasons. Some of those reasons
I will specify and amplify in
two considerations.
1. It will not stand either
with the justice, or wisdome
of God the Father, to loose
the glory of his everlasting
mercies in his sonne, by conferring
them vpon such as doe
not perceaue and acknowledge
some out-stripping excellency
in them beyond all his temporall
blessings. Indeed it is vsuall
with God in his generall
providence to heape his temporall
favours vpon such as never
thinke of his loue in dealing
thus bountifully with
them, but the reason of that is

because he can call them in againe,
and blow vpon them at
his pleasure, and though hee
get no glory for his mercy
whilest hee bestowes them as
blessings,^pirituall ^lessings ^re not so ^ommon ^s tempo^all. yet he can be sure to
glorify his justice by turning
them into curses: But now for
his everlasting mercies, those
riches of his loue in Christ, he
vseth not to part with them so
easily: hee lets not them goe
out of his hands: by his Ministers
hee proclaimes and displaies
the infinite worth and
value of them: if any man bee
so taken with the lustre of
them that for joy Mat. 13. 44.
he goes and sels all that he hath
to buy them,God presently giues an everlasting assurance of salvation to all who loue Christ sincerely. and thinkes hee
hath a good bargaine too, God
presently seales vnto him an
everlasting assurance of them
by the spirit of promise, and
giues possession of them at the

day of his death, when all other
possessions leaue him. But
now if any man thinke so
poorely of them, that either
he will not vouchsafe to cheapen
them, or if hee doe thinke
them worth the buying, yet
will not come off rou^dly, and
buy them outright with all
that he hath. I say it will not
stand either with the justice,
or wisdome of God the Father,
to cast them away vpon
such prodigious sorts. The
reason may be gathered out of
our Saviours words, Mat. 10.
37. He that loueth Father or
Mother more then mee is not
worthy of me: Alas, you will
say, no more is hee that loueth
him infinitely better, then his
Father and Mother: yes such a
one is worthy of him, not indeed
with such a worthinesse
as God may expect but with

such a worthinesse as he in justice
may accept: not with
such a worthinesse by which
he may deserue Christ,^t is an possible to bee ^ustifyed without Christ as to performe ^ny thing which may deserue Christ. for
then he would haue no need
of him, seeing that worthinesse
might aswell immediatly answere
the justice of God without
Christ, but with such a
worthinesse as may fit him having
need of Christ, and Christ
being freely given him to receiue
him. What kinde of
worthinesse is that? it is the
worthinesse of faith working
by loue, consisting in a thorough
sense of the extreame
misery of our greatest happinesse
without Christ, in a
cleare perswasion of the incomparable
worth of those
things which wee are promised
in Christ, and in a well advised
resolution to doe or suffer
any^ thing that we may bee

assured of our part in them.
But alas what worthinesse
is there in all this? seeing that
whatsoever wee can possibly
doe or suffer for Christ in this
life, is not, worthy to be compared
with the glory which
shall be revealed Rom. 8. 18.
I answere there can be indeed
no meritorious worthinesse
in all this, but there is an acceptable
worthinesse: for by
acceptance hee is worthy of
whatsoever God does for
him,There is a twofold worthines Acceptable and Meretorious. who in some good measure
vnderstands the worth of
his benefits and takes them to
heart, desiring and endeavouring
to giue him all the glory
which hee intended for himselfe
in bestowing them. The
principall thing God intends
in doing good vnto any of his
creatures is the glory of his
goodnesse, if therefore his

creature acknowledge his
goodnesse proportionably in
his benefits* desiring to value
them all single at that high
price, and in comparison one
aboue another proportionably
as the donor would haue hee
should, hee restore vnto God
that which he aimed at in his
benefits, and is worthy of
them with that worthinesse
which a Creator may expect
from a creature*It is not required by God that any creature should deserue his gifts. seeing an infinite
Creator which had need
of nothing, cannot expect any
thing from a finite creature
hauing nothing but what hee
first bestowed vpon it, but the
glory of his benefits.
Now to draw neerer vnto
the point: the greatest matter
containing in it infinite variety
of wonders, which God
from all eternity hath contrived
by his wisdome, compassed

by his power, bestowed by
his goodnesse vpon mankinde
to get himselfe as it were an
infinite masse of glory which
should suffice him through all
eternity, was the sending of
his owne sonne in our nature,
on our behalfe to satisfie his
justice.The Redemption of man is the most admirable worke of God. This was that astonishing
proiect, wherewith that
invisible Lord blessed for ever
intended in the fullest, compleatest
measure to glorify all
his attributes at once, and to
make himselfe farre more admirable
then hee was in the
creatio^ and government of the
world. This was that mistery
which was hidden from ages
and generations, in which
God would make knowne
the riches of his glory: Col. 1.
26. which holy men for many
ages together saluted a farre
off, and reioyced to see, though

it were through a cloud,
which the Angels themselues
desire (...)* most heedfully
to prie into 1. Pet. 1. 10. out
of their heavenly* places beholding
in the Church the manifold
wisdome of God. Ephes.
3. 10. This being so, whosoever
is admitted to see what i^
the fellowship of the mystery
which from the beginning of the
world hath beene hid in God, v.
9. If he be so caught vp with
admiration of it, that he grow
presently into a loathing of all
his other happinesse in comparison
of this; if at the sight
of such a concourse of wonders,
he be so ravished out of
himselfe, that hee care not
what become of what he most
doted on before, so that hee
may get his part in that fellowship,
I say, such a one is
worthy of Christ, because hee

giues God that glory which
Christ meant to procure him,
and therefore it will stand
both with his wisdome and
justice, to allot such a one his
portion out of those vnsearchable
riches of Christ Ep. 3. 8.
But on the contrary: whosoever
is admitted to the sight of
the fellowship of the same
mystery, if he can espy no such
extraordinary excellency in it
but that hee may keepe himselfe
as hee is, and hold fast
what he hath, if he ca^ discerne
no such superlatiue worth in
it as may call in his thoughts
from all other matters, and
command their attendance
vpon it selfe; if his affections
continue still glued vnto such
trash and mucke as they were
fastened on before, in a word,
if hee satisfy himselfe with
such grosse conceits as these,

that sure the things which are
offered vs in Christ are excellent
things, but offered vpon
very hard tearmes,They who ^ill not ^^ke Christ ^n those ^earmes he (...) offered, ^hall never enioy him. and therefore,
perhaps other matters
may be better for vs for the
present, that those are matters
of another world and
would bee good for vs when
we are dead, but in the meane
time it's* best for vs to make
as much of our selues as wee
can, and by Gods mercy wee
may at length haue our part in
those matters as well as those
that keepe most stirre about
them, (I say) such stupid sots
are so strangely vnworthy of
Christ, that God cannot doe
them any good: his wisdome
and his iustice will not suffer
him: it would infinitely lesse
become his wisdome to prostitute
such treasures vnto the
trampling of such swine, then

it would become the wisdome
of a man to giue children
Diamonds to play with,
who will bee better pleased
with cherrystones, or to feed
hounds with the most costly
dainties, which had rather be
doing vpon carrion. It's likewise
impossible for his iustice
to bestow his chiefest, choisest
mercies vpon such brutes
as will scarce take them for
mercies, being not throughly
perswaded that they haue any
need of them; did I say it
will not stand with the justice
of God to bestow his principall
mercies where they are
thus brutishly vndervalued:
nay hee that thus vndervalues
the^ must not carry it away so:
the justice of God will not suffer
him to let that man passe,
without the most heavy and
fearefull plagues that his omnipotency

can inflict, because
it is the greatest affront and
most intollerable despight,
that such wormes can offer his
impassible maiesty,They offer ^he greatest affront to God, who scorne his loue. thus as
much as in vs lies, to be foole
his wisdome and even scorne
his loue in that where hee
thought to doe vs most good
and himselfe most glory, wee
forsooth can see no such great
need of that, or extraordinary
reason for this.
Nay you will say, but wee
may value Gods loue in Christ
very highly, albeit wee esteeme
some few things
which our nature hath taken
speciall likeing vnto before it?
No such matter: Hee that esteemes
the dearest things he
hath, suppose his owne life,
but in the least degree aboue
it, vndervalues it as much in
effect as he that makes no account

of it at all: would any
man say that hee esteemed a
pearle who should preferre a
barley-corne before it: yet
there is some proportion betweene
a barley-corne and a
pearle, but none at all betweene
our temporall life and
that exceeding weight of glory,
treasured vp for vs by Gods
loue in Christ. O this loue of
God in sparing his owne son
for our redemption, is so full
of bottomlesse, fathomlesse
mysteries, it is in such transcendent
excesse infinite, that
those multitudes of his blessings
in our creation and preservation,
inestimable too in
themselues where with
(...) day by day
he loadeth vs Psal. 68. v. 19.
(take them altogether) are
not worth the talking off in
comparison of this, nor as wee

say to be named the same day
with it; O this sending of
Christ to dye for vs, when we
were yet sinners, was that
speciall, royal present wherewith
the King of heaven
would commend his loue vnto
vs, as the Apostle excellently
expresseth it Rom* 5. 8.
In this saith Saint Iohn 1. 4. 9.
was manifested the loue of God
towards vs that he sent his onely
begotten some into the world
that we might liue through him
manifested in this? Why, in
what not? so it is in every bit
of bread we eate, in every sup
of aire we take in. O but the
noblest blessings of this life
are such poore curtesies in
comparison of what we hope
for by Christ, that Gods loue
though most eminent too,
doe's scarse appeare in them,
being eclipsed by that most orient

and everlasting blaze of
his loue in Christ.
Wherefore to conclude
my first consideration: it is no
wonder if the justice of God,
which is to see that his Glory
receiue no damage, require
that our esteeme of this his
greatest mercy, which himselfe
values so farre aboue all
his other mercies, should so
far exceed our esteeme of any
other matters though otherwise
most excellent in themselues
and deare vnto vs, that
our very esteeme of them may
be but a disesteeme and a hatred
if compared to our esteeme
of his loue in Christ.
Consid. 2. If a man professe
never so much loue vnto
Christ,The seco^^ Reason. if hee doe indeed preferre
him before never so many
conveniences of this life,
yet if hee loue but any one

thing in the world never so
little better then hee doth
Christ, he doth him in effect as
much dishonour as he that never
lookes after him at all.
Thus much I intimated before;
but what I did but touch
vpon, and in reference to God
the father, I will now amplify
with speciall references
vnto God the sonne. It is all
one,It is all one ^ot to esteeme Christ at al and to preferre one though but one contentment before him. as I said before, not to esteeme
a pearle at all, and to
esteeme it lesse worth then a
barley-corne: in like manner,
though wee preferre Christ
before never so many profits
and pleasures, yet if there remaine
behind one darling contentment
which wee are resolued
to keepe whatsoever
may become of his glory or
our interest in him: wee doe
in the issue esteeme him not
at all, because wee still wittingly

value him below that
which is infinitely worse then
dung in comparison of him.
When a saleable commodity
is offered vpon reasonable
price, we vse to say that if it
be not worth that, it's worth
iust nothing: Now our part in
Christ is so infinitely overworth
any thing that wee can
possibly giue for it, that by
farre better reason wee may
say, that he that thinkes it not
cheape bought with all that
he hath even to his last breath,
indeed thinkes it worth nothing
at all. Let a woman loue
her husband better then a million
of men, yet if shee loue
but any one man in the world
better then her husband, hee
will giue her but little
thankes for louing him aboue
so many others.
But to amplify this point

more distinctly, let vs briefly
consider that transcendent
pitch of loue we owe first vnto
the benefits of Christ; secondly
vnto his person; All
those inestimable benefits
which wee make account of
by Christ may bee reduced to
2. heads 1. a ransome 2. an inheritance.
The ransome is
from horrours and those torments
which are infinite for
smart, variety and duration,
which wee haue all deserved
a thousand times over,Had the blessings procured by Christ beene infinitely lesse then they are, they had bin inestimable. and
therefore the case being thus
with vs, though wee looked
for nothing but such a ransome
by our Saviour, though he had
procured vs only this that after
this life wee should spend
eternity in a Limbus vnacquainted
with any paine or
pleasure, yea though hee had
procured vs only the mortality

of our soules, that they
might perish with our bodies;
I say this alone had beene beyond
all proportion, better for
vs then the whole world: seeing
what would a thousand
worlds doe vs good if after a
while wee must bee packed
out of them all into that place
where we shall everlastingly
curse the day that ever wee
were borne or made reasonable
creatures. But now that
besides all this, wee make first
account for an inheritance by
him, an inheritance immortall,
vndefiled, reserved in heaven
for vs, seeing wee expected to
be made heires with Christ in
that glory which hee had with
his father before the beginning
of the world, of that glory, the
least sparke of which if visible
to bodily eyes would shame
all the beauty, pompe and

bravery of the world, and
whatsoever the Magnifico's of
the earth are proud of, it is a
stupidity worse then any madnesse
to conceiue, we esteeme
sufficiently of such glorious
hopes, if vpon deliberate
choice we make much but of
any one indearement of this
life which may any way hinder
our assurance of them. 2.
for our loue vnto the person of
Christ, equity requires that we
should loue him with a loue
yet more overtopping then
either our ransome or inheritance,
and therefore it will be
yet a more intollerable extremity
of madnesse, to imagine
we loue him with an acceptable
degree of affection, as
long as we dare to bring the
most louely obiect that wee
can picke out of the storehouse
of nature within the

compasse of a comparison
with him.Wee sh^^ loue Chr^^^ person mor^e en^^rely then^ his benef^^* I say, reason
requires that wee should
loue his person more entirely
then his benefits, that wee
should preferre his glory before
eternall life it selfe. Our
Saviour is contented that our
feare of misery and desire of
happines, should first enter vs
into the loue of him, that til we
know him better wee should
loue him onely for our owne
sakes and his benefits, but after
that he hath sent his spirit to
expound the mystery of his
loue vnto vs more clearely, to
make vs lay to heart not onely
what he hath purchased for vs,
but also how deare the purchase
cost him, how though he
was rich, yet for our sakes hee
became poore that wee through
his poverty might be made rich

as the Apostle passionately deliuers
it, 2. Cor. 8. 9. how being
every way equall with God,
Phil. 2. 7. (...), he was faine
to emptie and strip himselfe as
it were of all his royaltie that
he might compasse these great
matters for vs, for whom hee
had not the least reason to doe
the least good: when his spirit
hath effectually melted our
hearts with these considerations,
(...) is a mer^^nary loue (...) loue Christ chie^^ly for our ^wn salvation. we shall perceaue our loving
him chiefly for our owne
salvation to be somewhat too
grosse and mercenary loue, being
not much different from
that of a woman who loues her
joynture better then her husband,
or that of a sonne, who
loues his Father chiefly for his
patrimony. And though hitherto
wee haue loued Christ
only because wee hope to get
by him, yet now that we know

what the kisses of his mouth
meane, that which we principally
loue in him is his loue, and
hauing before loued the giuer
for the gift, by a kinde of regresse
in our affection, wee
henceforth striue to loue gift
for the giuer. But this point
though many of Gods children
knowe it to bee most reasonable,
and haue found it most co^fortable,
yet I knowe it will
seeme to many both too rigide
and too curious, and therefore
I dismisse it.
All that hath beene deliuered
in my second consideratio^
may bee summed vp in this
excellent conclusion.So muc^^ only we loue Ch^^^^ as we lo^^ him be^^^ then any^^ thing else* So much
onely wee doe loue Christ as
wee loue him more then any
thing else besides though never
so louely: 1. Because wee
haue infinitely more reason
to loue him then it is possible

wee should haue to loue any
thing else: and therefore it is
not to be accounted loue vnto
him, if wee can afford as much
and more to something else:
2. Because if we loue but one
thing better then we doe him,
that one thing may force vs
to despight, forsake, and betray
him as accursedly as if we preferred
a hundred things before
him: yea, hee that resoluedly
preferres but one thing before
his communion with
Christ will quickly be entreated
by his owne heart to preferre
more. He therefore that
would certainely knowe how
much hee loues his blessed Saviour,
that would judge exactly
of the measure of his loue
vnto him, must not doe it by
feeling the pulse as it were, or
calculating the degrees of his
affectio^ vnto him; but by comparing

his affectio^ vnto Christ
with his affections vnto other
matters, and considering how
farre that hath got the start of
these, and what overplus it
hath beyond them all in the
comparison; for so much and
no more doth hee indeed loue
Christ. For it deserues observation:
that we cannot judge
of an affection by its single exercises
what it does alone by
it selfe, but onely when it is
brought within the lists, when
it's put to wrestle for the mastery
with other affections in
the same heart. Where it
comes to passe that of two affections
of the same kinde, the
weaker may proue the stronger,
if seated in a heart, where
as weake as it is, it hath the soveraignty
over all the other
affections proportionally weaker
then it selfe; and the stronger

may proue the weaker if it
dwell in such a heart, wherein
it is overmatched with some
one at least stronger then it
selfe. Did I loue Christ Iesus
with as eminent degree of
loue as ever did the most resolute
Martyr, yet were it possible
that I should loue any endearement
of this life never
so little beyond that pitch, my
loue would be as good as none
at all; yea the same measure of
loue which made him a glorious
Martyr, would not keepe
me from being an accursed Apostate,
seeing that if I were
put to it, as he was, that I must
either renounce my Saviour
or my other contentment, this
would hold me so fast, that it
would make mee most desperately
let him goe: and this
would bee not because my
loue vnto Christ was in it selfe

weaker then the Martyrs: I
supposed the contrary: but because
my affection vnto something
else was stronger then
any affection in the Martyr, and
too strong to be over-mastred
by my loue vnto Christ.
But here some may put in a
foolish question; though a Disciple
of Christ must not loue
any thing better then his Master,
yet may he not loue some
things as well? I answere the
conceipt is impossible. First,
Because it is an impossibility,
that for any continuance our
affections should bee setled in
an equall size vpon two objects,
which commonly fall
crosse one to the other and may
ever and anon bee brought in
opposition one against the other.
Now whatsoever wee
loue besides Christ vnlesse it
be in subordination vnto him,

either actually, when we particularly
thinke of it and intend
it, or habitually, in the generall
constant purpuse of our minds,
wee loue it in opposition to
him either explicite and direct,
or implicite and interpretatiue,
as the Schooles speake
(that is) such neglect of him
as he wil interpret opposition.
All this we learne from himselfe
who hath pronounced it
impossible that one ma^ should
serue two masters, and his reason
is, hee must needs hate the
one, and loue the other, Math.
6. 24. 2. Wee may note that
loue and the rest of the affections
may bee considered two
waies. 1. Physically, as they
are qualities in the soule.
2. Morally, in respect of their
motiues and other morallizing
circumstances. Now suppose
it were possible that wee

should loue Christ and some
worldy contentment which
the very same degree of affection,If we lo^^ any contentment (...) equally with Chri^^^ ^ee loue Christ indeed farre lesse then that contentment.
although these loues
would bee equall considered
naturally as qualities, yet considered
morally, our loue of
Christ would be farre lesse the^
our loue of the other contentment:
seeing our loue of that
vpon small reasons would bee
as great as our loue of Christ
vpon the greatest reasons that
ever were, or ever can bee to
obserue and perswade the
greatest loue. Thus in two co^siderations
haue you heard explained,
confirmed, and amplified
this maine doctrine, whosoever
hee bee that makes account
to bee the better for his
profession of Christ.
Before I descend to application
I suppose it expedient
to vindicate this fundamentall

point from some exceptions
which it may be charged with
by such as doe not or will not
vnderstand it.The point (...) vindica^ed from ^ome exce^tions.
In the first place, it may be
objected, if none can get the
rich pearle in the parable but
he that will giue all hee hath
for it: if none can haue his part
in Christ but he that prizeth it
aboue his life, and is ready to
buy it with whatsoever is
deare vnto him, what meanes
then that Evangelicall proclamation
Esa. 55. 1, Ho every
one that thirsteth come yee to
the waters, and hee that hath no
money; come and buy milk without
money, and without price?
What meanes that nuptiall invitation,
Rev. 22. The spirit and
the bride say come, and let him
that heareth say come, and whosoever
wil, let him take of the water
of life freely. What are we

invited and entreated to drink
on free cost of the water of
life, and yet must we venture
our liues for it, and breake
through a whole host of Philistines
for it, as the Worthies
of David did for the waters of
Bethel. 2. Sam. 23. Are wee
made beleeue that Christ is given
vs freely, and yet must we
buy him, and buy him with all
that wee haue? I answere,
1. That proclamation in the
Prophet, and invitation in the
Apocalyps are not to be so vnderstood,
as if God required
nothing on their parts who
shall partake of his promises
in Christ, but only to step forth
and challenge them. The sense
and scope of those places is
this, whereas worldly commodities
though never so
vaine and transitory cannot be
gotten without price, so that

he that is pennilesse must bee
content to goe without them,
those heavenly and everlasting
commodities are attaineable
to all sorts of men, as well to
beggars as to Princes, poverty
can hinder no man from buying
them, hee that hath not a
penny may come and drinke
as freely of the waters of life
as he that hath coffers full. As
God expects from vs whatsoever
we haue, so that which
we haue for him shall serue
the turne though it bee never
so little, though wee haue nothing
but the shirt on our
backes; but our naked, deseased
carkasses, yet if we are willing
to giue them for Christ, they
shall bee sufficient pay. God
turnes away no chapman because
hee cannot giue enough,
but only because hee will not
giue what he can. For if there

be first a willing minde, God
accepts according to that a ma^
hath and not according to that
a man hath not, as it is spoken
in another case. 2. Cor. 8. 12.
2. When wee are said to buy
the pearle, to buy Christ withall
that wee haue, such like
speeches are in no wise to bee
vnderstood properly but Parabolically;
for in propriety of
speech, when wee forsake all
to winne Christ, wee doe not
lay down any price vnto God
for him, who hath giuen him
for vs all and offered him to every
one of vs most freely, only
we ridde our selues of such
things as may hinder vs from
receauing him being freely given.
If one should offer mee
handfulls of Gold* I for the
present hauing my hands full
of clay, I should quickly be rid
of the clay that I may finger

the gold, yet I doe not pay him
for his gold with my clay, but
only prepare my selfe to receaue
it. In like manner there
being an infinitely greater disproportion
betweene Christ
and the most pretious commodities
that wee can forgoe
for him; then there is between
gold and clay when wee dismember
our selues of any
thing that wee may make
roome for Christ, wee doe not
purchase him, but prepare to
entertaine him comming of
his owne accord vnto vs.
^ But is it so in earnest,
will some say? must every ma^
that will bee the better for
Christ, be willing to loose his
owne life for him? This is
worse then all the rest, why
then, vpon the point, none can
bee saued but Martyrs. I answer,
wee may safely affirme

that none are saued but Martyrs;
Martyrs either actually
or habitually*Whether any can be saued but Martyrs* hauing faith enough
to encourage and loue
to constraine them to be Martyrs,
if the honour of their profession
should require it. If
this assertion make any mans
eares to tingle, I knowe not
why the hearing of my Text
should not be as offensiue vnto
him, or the reading of divers
other speeches of our Sauiour,
requiring a resolued disesteeme
and contempt of life
in any man whosoeuer hee be
that dares to set his hand to
his plough, or seriously set his
face towards heauen.
There is a Popish scribler
not worth the naming in a
pulpit, who would perswade
vs that these speeches of our
Saviour are not precepts of
necessity vnto all that shall be

saued by him, but onley counsells
of perfection to such as
will not bee contented to bee
doore-keepers in heauen, but
ayme at some higher place.
For my part I cannot expresse
how injurious I conceaue this
glosse, as well to our Saviours
person, as to his doctrine. But
if any man present to set his
owne heart at quiet, bee willing
to bee of this fellowes
mind, I leaue him three things
to pause vpon. 1. Our Saviour
did not speake thus much only
to some select, forward men,
only to his speciall Disciples,
but as it is in the verse precedent,
there went great multitudes
after him, and he turned
and said vnto them, If any man,
etc. But perhaps though hee
addresse his discourse to them
altogether, yet hee intended it
not to each of them single. No,

what then meane the first
words of my Text, If any man
etc. what meanes the conclusion
of his discourse, verse, 33.
So likewise whosoever he be of
you that forsaketh not all that
he hath he cannot be my Disciple.
2. The considerations
which shew the equity of
those conditions required by
our Saviour, the reasons inducing
him to require so great a
measure of loue, as you haue
heard before, equally* concern
every man, and therefore there
is no reason why wee should
imagine that our Saviour proposed
these hard tearmes only
to some few and not to all that
would haue any interest in
him. 3. Contempt of life in
comparison of a communion
with Christ is most vniversally
requisite in all sorts of men.
1. Because the Church never

enioyes such a calme, but a terrible
storme may vnexpectedly
dash it away, and therefore
there is no man though borne
in the most peaceable time of
the Gospell, but ere the glasse
of his life bee runne out, hee
may be over taken with a fiery
triall. 2. Yea there is no professour
of the Gospell, though
hee liue and dye during the
publike tranquillity of it, yet
he may privately bee brought
to that plunge, that he must either
hazard his life, or else in
some fearefull, horrible maner
against his conscience dishonour
Christ Iesus. 3. Many
may take away our liues
which cannot take away our
other contentments, as Popish
Assascinats haue depriued
Kings of their liues when they
could not of their kingdomes.
It is certaine that whosoever

cares not for his owne life is
master of another mans, and by
consequent of any mans religion
that loues his life better
then hee doth it. How easie
were it for a Ruffian that had
no religion of his own* to pull
such a one into a corner and
with a naked blade to make
him forsweare his religion, as
often as he pleased, yea if the
tricke were in vse, such a one
might be robbed of his religion
vpon the high way seeing
any man that were so disposed
with a Pistol at his brest might
make him deliuer vp his faith
with as much hast as his purse.
3* It may bee replied if every
follower must loue him
more then his owne life, then
it seemes that the weakest
Christian, if indeed a Christian
must loue him as much as the
most renowned Apostles, seeing

the best of them all could
loue him no more then so, for
greater loue then this hath no
man then that he lay downe his
life for his friend, witnesse
Christ Iesus himselfe, Iohn. 15
13. It seemes likewise that all
must haue an equall portion
of faith; both which consequencies
palpably contradict
both Scripture and experience.
I answere first without
question all that shall be saued
must bee saued by the same
faith, viz: by faith of the same
nature, though not in the same
quantitie. Now that which
breeds the mistake in this objection,
is a conceipt* that to
loue Christ more then our
liues proceeds not from the
nature of saving faith simply
considered, but from some eminent
degree of it, which co^ceipts
is erronious. For it is very

observable, that the nature
of faith, if true and saving, bee
the degree of it never so small
necessarily includes thus
much: it being an assent vnto
all Scripture revelations, especially
vnto the Gospell promises,
as most true and good in
themselues, and farre better in
the choice then any profits or
pleasures in the world, yea the^
life or whatsoever may sweeten
it vnto vs. Whence an incomparable
writer of our own
who hath dived profoundly
into the nature of justifying
faith, hath weaued the words
of David, Ps. 63. Thy louing
kindnesse is better then life, into
his compleat definition of that
faith whereby the iust doe
liue. 2. Though all the Disciples
of Christ must assent to so
much be their faith, and expresse
if need bee, so much by their

loue, yet according as those
tasts and relishes of heaven
imprinted in their soule by
the spirit, vpon which the
assent of faith, and fervency of
loue are grounded are more
or lesse liuely and pleasant,
the faith and loue of Christians
admit sundry degrees and
measures: but not properly in
regard of their esteeme of the
object, (for all, as I haue shewed,
must esteeme it better then
life) but in respect of the radication
and setling of this esteeme
in themselues* so that
howsoever all faithfull Christians
iudge and esteeme their
hopes by Christ to bee better
then life, yet they may bee
more or lesse in their iudgement,
and those apprehensions
which cause this esteeme may
be more or lesse cleere and distinct.
3. Tis true, that to dye

for the profession of Christ is
the greatest possible expression
of loue vnto him, for the
matter of it there may bee
great diversity* and accordingly
by severall degrees of faith,
and loue may bee expressed by
it. Amongst so many thousands
as haue beene crowned with
martyrdome in Primitiue and
latter times, no doubt but there
was infinite variety of degrees
of faith and loue, all which had
but one common expression
for the matter; but for the maner
of it, some laid down their
liues more cheerefully and
triumphantly reioycing that it
was giuen to them, not only to
beleeue, but also to suffer: others
with more deliberation,
staggering, and reluctancy some
with Peter denied Christ divers
times before they would
dye for him, recanted a^iured,

and runne through a hundred
of base sights before they
would come to the stake,
others behaued themselues
more honourably and heroically,
and being glad of such speedy
conveyance to heaven died
with a kinde of Angelicall
Majestie.
To drawe towards a conclusion:
if any honest tender
heart, which vses to tremble
at the word, and to mourne for
its own infirmities, be brought
into dumps by this doctrine,
causing it to thinke thus with
it selfe; if every one that loues
Christ to any purpose must
loue him better then life, and
be able to dye for him, then
sure al my loue vnto him is nothing
worth*^^ When I am in
my best moodes his louing
kindnesse is dearer vnto mee
then thousands of gold and silver,

and I am of Davids mind
that it is better then life, but
yet if my life were in question
for it, I know not what would
become of me, sure I should
never hold out but flinch most
shamefully. For comfort and
direction vnto such a soule I
commend these considerations.
1. This feare of flinching
is a good signe, that thou
wouldest not flinch for feare:
you know what Peters loud
protestation (though all men
forsake thee yet will not I)
came to not long after, you
know the story of Dr Pendleton,
or you may reade it in
Mr Fox, vnlesse thy life were
exceeding deare vnto thee,
it would be no such great testimony
of thy loue vnto him,
to part with it for his sake;
vnlesse death were very terrible,
Martyrdome would

not bee either such an acceptable
sacrifice vnto God,
or glorious wonder amongst
men. To feare martyrdome,
yea and to pray against
it with submission vnto
Gods will, is warranted by
our Saviours owne example,
when he prayed so earnestly,
that if it were possible the
Cup might passe away from
him, but still with submission
vnto his fathers pleasure. That
place concerning our Saviour,
Heb. 5. 7. is very remarkable,
who in the daies of his flesh,
when he had offered vp prayers
and supplications, with strong
crying and teares vnto him,
that was able to saue him from
death, and was heard in that
he feared. I stand not vpon the
words in that hee feared, for
indeed the construction of the
words (...), is very

vncertaine, that which I especially
note, is, that it is said
here, our Saviouor was heard
how was hee heard? Marke
how, and thence will spring a
second branch of comfort. His
Father heard him, not in remouing
the Cup from him,
but in strengthning* him to
drinke it with victory: so art
thou sure to be heard, if thou
prayest as hee did: either the
Cup shall bee removed from
thee, or sweetned vnto thee.
Remember withall, that God
is never more for vs, then
when wee are most for him,
that his glory lies at stake as
well as thy life, and that hee
is more curious of that, then
thou canst bee of this. God is
faithfull who will no^ suffer vs
to be tempted aboue that we are
able; but will with the temptation
also make away to escape

that we may be able to beare it.
1. Cor. 10. 13. Remember
that thy Saviour hath had experience
of all the amazemets
and horrors of death when he
suffered it for the^e, and therefore
cannot forget, both to
pitty and succour thee when
thou art to suffer it* for him:
for in that he himselfe hath suffered
being tempted he is able to
succour them that are tempted,
as the Apostle sweetly infers,
Heb. 2. 18.
Lastly, let mee commend
this caution vnto the trembling
soule; Anxious distrustfull
care for the future in matters
of the soule, is more dishonourable
and displeasing vnto
God, then in matters of the
body. Remember therefore
thy Saviours advice, care not
for to morrow, let that care for
it selfe. Afflict not thy selfe

with such sad supposals, what
if Queene Maries daies
should come againe; what if
I should bee brought before
such a fellow as Bonner, remember
thy Saviours reason
for his advice, sufficient for the
day is the evill thereof. Which
as it is too true for matters of
this life, so it's much more true
in businesse of our spirituall
life. If thou art indeed entred
into a covenant with God, if
thou hast seriously and advisedly
resolued to liue the rest
of thy time in the flesh by the
faith of the sonne of God who
hath loued thee and giuen
himselfe for thee, if thou art
indeed one who knowes what
an infinite, endlesse, vnwearied
diligence is required to a
constant, close walking with
God, why then thou hast every
day, every houre, omission^

and commissions to looke
vnto, thou hast continuall
swarmes of thoughts, words,
and actions most warily, and
precisely to watch over, thou
must tread every step as nicely
and gingerly, as if thou
wentest amongst sna^es, and
walkedst vpon pinnacles, thou
must ever and anon chaine vp
thy beloued affections shorter,
and deale roughly with those
lusts, which perhaps are as
deare vnto thee as thy life.
What hast thou thus* much businesse
every day; and hast thou
time to make suppositions for
the future, and to torment
thy selfe with presages? Let
to morrow care for it selfe: abstaine
from fleshly lusts which
fight against thy soule and most
dangerously in times of peace:
stand vpon thy gard against
thy sinnes of daily incursion,

against such temptations as
are incident to thy present
condition, in simplicity of
heart resigne thy selfe vp vnto
him, that hath loued thee and
given himselfe for thee, and
thou be confident, that neither
life nor death, neither things
present nor things to come shall
ever be able to separate thee
from him: this being most
certaine that he that does indeed
liue by faith, hath that in
him, which, if need should be,
will enable him to die in it and
for it.
But what reason had I then
at this time to trouble mens
heads with such a thorny discourse
of Martyrdome? I answere.
1. The habite of Martyrdome,
as I haue shewed, is
included in the most fundamentall
principle of Christianity,
loue of Christ better

then our selues, selfe resignation
or deniall: and therefore
they deserue no answere but
silence, who shall thinke a discourse
of it at any time to bee
harsh and vnseasonable. 2. As
the Prophet Ezechiel forewarned
the Iewes, Wee haue
had mischiefe vpon mischiefe,
and rumor vpon rumor, and if
mischiefe and rumors continue
and multiply vpon vs as fast as
they haue done of late, the
daies may bee sooner vpon vs
then wee are aware, when
there may be too much occasion
to practise this point and
no time to preach it. The Lord
open our eyes and change our
hearts, the Lord of his mercy
order matters for vs, above all
that wee are able to aske or
thinke, contrary to the cry of
our sinnes, contrary to probabilities,
that the event may

proue such discourses vnseasonable.
Here now should follow
a large application of the
maine doctrine branched into
divers vses, but that if God
giue leaue shall ere long be
the exercise of another houre.
FINIS.
