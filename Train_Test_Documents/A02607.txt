a inqvisition of the true church and those that revolt from it 1. John 2.19 they go out from we but they be not of we for if they have be of we they will have continue with we but this come to pass that it may appear that they be not all of we in the former verse the apostle make mention both of one and many antichrist for as Hilary write every one be Antichrist that do not acknowledge Christ in the same manner that the apostle preach he so it come to pass that there be many antichrist according to Christ his prediction there shall arise false Christ and false prophet to deceive if it be possible the very elect. old father simeons prophecy when he take our bless saviour into his arm sort to the same conclusion immediate before the good man do sing his swan-like song of he pronounce free that which succeed time have verify that the child jesus shall be set as a sign to be speak against not by one but by many he be in the world and the world know he not he come unto his own and his own receive he not but among those many contrary that Christ shall have the holy ghost in the scripture point at one capital Antichrist who will exceed all the rest all be dangerous adversary careful to be avoid to that end we be admonish of they and indeed who be more to be avoid of christian than they who oppose themselves against Christ our lord yet none of they be to be eschew with so much care or diligence as those which cover their opposition against Christ with title of piety of holiness under the name and pretence of Christ as if they be his vicar or vicegerent and do all for he profess hostility and open contradiction can never have advance the kingdom of Antichrist for who be so wretched or giantlike desperate to enterprise war with God the devil himself be the prince of darkness when he will draw most awry and seduce be transform into a angel of light even so do Antichrist pretend the name of Christ the key of Peter his seat his succession and the allure name of the church seduce great troop of unheedefull soul that he can never gain with open profession of impiety such be the efficacy of his deceivableness such be the mystery of his iniquity under these habit or sheep clothing he disguise his wolvish ravin let we not then be miscarry with outward show or title but examine and weigh every thing by the balance of the sanctuary for our better information in this caveat the apostle by the passage of my text do brand this antichristian troop with a legible mark whereby you may sure know they they go out from we they revolt they fall away they forsake and slide away from the church and the doctrine thereof they depart from the fellowship and communion of saint behold a visible mark a true cognizance to discern the antichristian sort and needful it be that we shall have such print or character to discover they in regard of the great peril and danger which they bring to themselves and other that be sway by they it be the sentence of s. cyprian simplic praelator and very orthodox each one that be sever from the true church and join to the false as to a adulteress be certain cut off from the promise make to the church neither can he be interest in Christ his promise which forsake Christ his church he be a stranger he be profane he be a enemy he can now have God to his father which will not reverence and obey the church as his mother the use of this doctrine be to admonish we to gather ourselves into the society and fellowship of the church psal 84. how amiable be thy tabernacle o lord of host what happiness be it to be join in company and consort with the patriarch Abraham Isaac and jacob with the prophet with the apostle with the martyr with the holy angel of God and with Christ himself take heed therefore belove brother and beware that you bereave not yourselves of the comfort dispense unto you out of the church beware that you cut not yourselves off from this heavenly communion or company through singularity or headiness of courage pluck not up the tare in prejudice or detriment to the wheat but suffer both to grow together until the harvest and let he separate which have the fan in his hand to purge the floor I know it will here be object that the antichristian sort may be well discover by their apostasy and relinquish the church when the church itself be not controvert but where the church be ambiguous that man make question where the true church be whether it be with those that profess the gospel of jesus Christ sincere or among such as have addict themselves to the bishop of Rome there the notice of apostasy be not perspicuous it be not easy to be take for as wasp make themselves comb like to bee so heretic have their conventicle their synagogue which they adorn with the style and title of church and this paint have ever make a debate when doubt be move where the church shall be there be but two manner of inquest or trial to find it either by the mark which we have devise ourselves or by evidence which Christ jesus the lively head of the church have prescribe for the manifestation of it and this latter inquisition by the judgement of saint Augustine be the sure and fair proof for CHRIST be truth and know his own body best do not the lord know who be he yes certain he call his own sheep by name joh. 10. on the other side sad experience teach we that live in this age how miserable they be mistake that go about to point out the church not by any certain demonstration out of the holy scripture but by deceivable fantasy of man wherein they commend antiquity first for a special mark of the church and consider not that it may be counterfeit or pretend without any truth of right and just antiquity do not the gibeonite plead it in that manner for their rag their overwear shoe and mould bread so they do if they circumvent a wise and vigilant governor with such colourable plea how much easy be it to beguile ignorant and simple people or to put they into error by mask and pretence of feign antiquity and though we have not any cause to avoid or shun the trial of true antiquity which come from the ancient of day nor our adversary to presume of it the unpartial and due consideration of the thing itself will certain evict that antiquity can be any firm or individual companion of the church and so no good mark for then the church must have be ancient in the very infancy or beginning thereof which be a thing impossible antiquity be commendable not in itself or when it be alone but as it be join with verity therefore I conclude this article with the same exhortation that the prophet jeremy use to the man of his time stand upon the way and consider which be the old way and the good way and walk in it that you may find rest to your soul let we pass on further to the consideration of other mark and you shall see it can stand good to make the church always visible or conspicuous that will take away a article of our faith and creed when we believe there be a church we do affirm plain that it be not visible or ocular to be discern Heb. 11. for faith be a apprehension of thing that can be see so believe there be a church as be by all profess we acknowledge therein that the same be not visible why shall any speak of multitude to be a mark of the church luc. 19 see Christ himself call it a little flock this mark of multitude have be a weak and impertinent allegation when all the world be drown but eight person save in the ark and that be then the whole number of the church or when the five city be destroy with fire and Lot only escape with his two daughter or in Elias time when he complain he be leave alone the church be not ever in one state but like the moon sometime increase sometime diminish sometime at the full sometime in the wain and therefore the multitude or paucity of people in the church be but accident and not essential inherent in the church be make mark of the church unproper thus they be deceive and deceive other that seek and set forth a church in their own word I will not have any demonstration of the church make unto i say s. Augustine out of man instruction but from the oracle of God seek then for the church in the word of Christ and the demonstration thereof will be infallible our bless saviour send his disciple into all the world that be the extent of the church he charge they to preach the gospel unto every creature to baptize they in the name of the father of the son and of the holy ghost and to teach they to observe all that he have command these be the thing which the son of God will have practise in his house and by they you may easy find out the church of God the sincere doctrine of the gospel the true and right administration of the sacrament and that form of discipline which may bring obedience to his commandment who can make that a church where these thing be want who can deny it to be a church where they be exercise my sheep say our saviour hear my voice therefore the word of God must be read it must be preach it must sound among they else how be it possible that they shall hear it aug. epist 166. the scripture which be propound to all man say s. Augustine be the usual mark to know Christ and his church by so Christ say himself if you abide in i and my word abide in you you be very my disciple but alas how can his word abide in those which hear not of they that be forbid to hear or know they cypr. lap ser. 5. there can be no peace but war with such people neither can they be join to the church that sever themselves ^^om the gospel or put case they have the gospel yet if it be not expound true unto they if it be not teach pure and sincere what advantage it they as all gold be not holy but that only which belong to the sanctuary so every sense that be without the compass of holy writ glister without never so much otherwise yet can it not be holy unless it be conform to the word of God Hierony in cap 5 whosoever interpret the scripture otherwise then the holy ghost mean by which it be write may well be call a heretic although he be not depart from the church be not the interpretation from God joseph teach we they be from God in expound pharaoh dream then much more be the interpretation of holy scripture from God by the same spirit the scripture be write by the same they must be interpret and understand 2. cor. 2. for what man know the thing of a man save the spirit of a man that be within he even so the thing of God know no man but the spirit of God and those that be teach of God scripture be not of private interpretation but must be interpret by scripture the dark place by those which be more plain and easy and as Tertullian write the interpretation of the scripture must be make according to the meaning of the more place and lest that one text shall war against many other that be to be expound in a correspondency to all the rest rather than in a repugnancy unto they and if you will try the spirit whether they be of God or no as s. John advise we or examine every interpretation we have two rule to measure they by the first examination be whether their interpretation and exposition be refer to the glory of God or no if they tend to the glory of God our saviour Christ give they a warrant of truth he that in his exposition seek my glory be a true interpreter let we now in the name of God come to the trial of particular by this rule be it possible for they to seek the glory of God in the question of justification which refuse the justification by jesus Christ and attribute salvation to their own merit who magnify the ability of human nature and extenuate the unsearchable riches of God grace I conceive no possibility or appearance of it alas how miserable be they which will not have salvation itself sufficient to save they belove let we not abrogate the grace of God for s. Augustine write true we live in more safety when we ascribe the whole work of our justification to God the second trial of interpretation be whether they be agreeable with the proportion of faith for he that prophesy must do it accorcord to the proportion of faith measure the doctrine of romish catholic by this rule and I think it will not prove catholic can the invocation of saint stand with the proportion of faith will they believe in saint and how can they call on they in who they have not believe I can stand upon many such particular which you all do see may be allege but be force through straightness of time to conclude they in this general Hierony in cap. 1. these interpretation of scripture which do not agree with the proportion of faith make of Christ a man gospel or a devil and that be worse the ark of God and Dagon can stand together there be no agreement between light and darkness the purity of the gospel will never admit sophistication of human devise howsoever the council of Trent will have both to be receive alike Sess 4. namely the book of both testament and the unwritten tradition with equal piety and affection of reverence it be true that the apostle deliver many thing over ten@ which apostolic man receive and deliver again faithful to their disciple but let that be well remember withal which write that all these thing be (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) they be all agreeable to the scripture and their write be it probable or shall we believe that the apostle write we shall take heed and beware of image do leave any tradition that time will come wherein the use of picture and image will be requisite or fit in the church be it credible that the idol of jupiter Mars Mercury etc. shall be cast out of all temple by the apostle doctrine and a tradition from the apostle to set up the portraiture of Christ of the bless virgin Mary or their own picture in place of the other be it possible that they which teach we to worship and call upon one god alone do ever give any tradition for themselves also to be worship and call upon when they be depart this life that they which write we have a advocate with the father jesus Christ the righteous do ever order that themselves also will be our advocate no no. it be impossible it be incredible it can be conceive without disparagement to the apostle that man of their rank and integrity inspire and govern by the holy ghost shall deliver or utter any thing by word of mouth vary or dissent from the attestation they leave in writing the pure word of God without addition or diminution be the true mark of the church and so the huckster that chop and change it to serve their own invention or turn carry not the right cognizance of christian touch sacrament and the due administration thereof which be another mark of a true church they that be most confident and make great vaunt of the church do no way administer they right save that by God his providence the essential form of baptism be retain among they otherwise they profane it not a little when they apply it to senseless thing as to bell when they add salt oil and hospital be not the element of water sufficient which Christ institute to represent his precious blood to wash away our sin without those mixture the other sacrament of the lord supper they have not defile as they have do baptism but they have quite alter and change it into a curse and abominable idol of their mass and so have prevent and annihilate Christ his holy institution for first whereas two thing be necessary in sacrament the sign and the thing signify they take away the sign for establish of their transubstantiation second they shall distribute it unto other and they keep it only to themselves and so make it private whereas it shall be a public banquet three they keep the cup from the people which our saviour command shall be give to all four in the supper Christ offer himself to we and their priest offer he unto God who indeed can be offer but by his eternal spirit nor without his death whereas he die but once for ever and where these thing be do the essential part of the sacrament be not keep therefore no supper no sacrament but a horrible profanation and plain sacrilege lap whatsoever be institute by human temereity to violate God his ordinance be adulterous it be impious it be sacrilegious as for those man discipline whereby people shall be bring to the obedience of Christ his commandment the world see their wilful negligence in which case I must needs approve of that which s. Chrysostome write to the people of Antioch hom. 17. the city that be not inhabit with good man be more unpleasing to i then the base village see therefore the church of Rome retain not the sincere purity of the word see it have abolish one of the sacrament and corrupt the other profane see it have little or no care at all of godly discipline man may peradventure make doubt or question whether it be the church of God or no I dare not whole take away the name of a church from it I know that Antichrist shall sit in the temple of God that baptism can be administer out of the church and when the entire form of baptism be observe s. Augustine be resolve there it be not the heretic that baptise but Christ do it by the hand of a heretic therefore the council of nice determine very grave that there shall be no rebaptisation of such as be baptize by heretic yet I do not allow the romish synagogue to be a church simple but by equivocation and (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) as the woman carry the name of your wife which you do once marry and afterward find she defile with adultery yet because she keep the marriage ring and some other pledge of her former wedlock she still bear the name of your wife so it be with the church of Rome albeit for her adultery she have deserve a divorce just yet because the bridegroom have not give she his bill of divorce but suffer she hitherto to hold baptism as it be the marriage ring I account it a church but miserable deform and infect with infinite error I can reckon it less than a part of discourtesy and of more advantage than God truth need so to contend with the adversary thereof as not to admit of those grace among they which God be please to vouchsafe unto they let we give every one his right let our adversary in the name of God hold their due let we willing yield they all that do appertain unto they and let we tax their corruption nevertheless with all freedom this be heroical this be prophetical this be apostolical and much more than they will yield unto we for without hear of we or our cause they which be party against we take upon they to be our judge too and to condemn we for heretic for schismatic and to have no church at all like to that see the right heir joas crown king of judah cry treason treason when she be great traitor herself indeed if we unchurch congregation for schism or for simple heresy there will be no good warrant unless the heresy impugn one of the three person of the holy trinity direct then the heresy be not single but arise to infidelity which be the bane and cutthroat of all church but our adversary do charge we also with apostasy and that be a mark of Antichrist mention in our text they go out from we but they be not of we hereupon our rhemish seminary note that Luther and calvin go out of their church that be of papist become protestant but they come not out of we and that be the catholic church which be forsake to admit that which will not easy be prove that England first receive the christian faith from Rome both in the time of their bishop and also in the time of Augustine their monk yet will it not thereon follow that we must still fetch our religion from Rome as from the chief fountain and wellspring of all godliness for if any man fall away from that church which be not Christ his spouse he can be charge just with apostasy it be no shame to change for the better or if a man do leave and depart from a particular church in body and yet forsake not the communion and fellowship of the apostle doctrine nor the sacrament right administer but hold they with all other sincere church that man be no chrysost in mat. hom. 46. he go not out of the church that depart corporal but he that spiritual have forsake the foundation of ecclesiastical truth the right apostasy be a fall away from the true catholic and apostolic church of Christ and therefore from Christ and that by revolt from the apostle doctrine and the communion of the catholic faith they go out from we if Luther calvin and ourselves go out of the church of Rome we incur no crime of apostasy therein because we leave that church which be neither catholic nor apostolic we leave not bethel that be the house of God until it become bethaven that be the house of iniquity a apostolic church it be not because it rest not upon the doctrine of the apostle but be fall from it as we have former show in which case eccles. we have s. Augustine grave advise no consent be to be give to those bishop which be catholic when they be deceive or hold any thing contrary to the canonical scripture we then in go out of that church where the word of God be not pure teach and the sacrament be not administer due according to our saviour Christ his holy institution and God be not worship after the apostle doctrine make no default or departure from the church but as Moses go out of Egypt let out of Sodom Elias from Baal priest and that be no apostasy but a renunciation of their apostasy that we may marshal ourselves under the standard of our head and captain Christ jesus and so enter into true Jerusalem which be mother of we all if the church of Rome give impediment to we in this passage it be a stepdame no true mother no apostolic church neither be it the catholic but a particular church as the church be of Alexandria Milan Ephesus etc. the church be call catholic first in respect of place when it be not appropriate or fix to any certain place as the jew do dream of jerusalem long ago and the papist do now dote of Rome but reach unto all part and place of the world second it be call catholic in respect of person comprehend in it because no sort of people be exclude or refuse for now the wall of partition be pull down and we be all one in Christ jesus three it be call catholic in respect of time that whensoever it have beginning yet it continue for ever either militant here upon earth or triumphant in heaven so the whole family or house of God be divide four and last the church be call catholic in respect of doctrine therein profess for it embrace and maintain not part or portion but the whole body of prophetical and apostolical doctrine the church of Rome be not catholic in any of these respect and therefore we plead not guilty of apostasy in leave it let our adversary meditate rather how to clear the church of Rome of apostasy for it be fall away from they of who it receive the gospel faith religion and the name of a church let they refuse their synagogue forsake their break cistern that will hold no water return to that true and ancient faith for which they be once renown through the world and we shall run together again in a holy union with they if they will not I call heaven and earth to record against they this day that they themselves be fall from the gospel from truth from word from sacrament from religion from Christ from the apostle and church of Christ all which we uphold with great endeavour for they have break the band wherewith they be couple to the apostle they have relinquish that communion which former they hold with the church these band be of two sort outward and inward the outward band may be cut in sunder as the profession of true doctrine and the right administration of the sacrament both which band be break by our adversary as we have show some proof of before and they shall never be able to throw any just aspersion upon we in that kind the lord of heaven and earth be praise for it among the inward couple election be first for all that belong true to the church be bind together in heaven in the bundle of life with their God the other be the band of Christ his holy spirit which work the same faith and love in the member that be in Christ our head these inward band can be dissolve or cut in sunder for neither can God his eternal election be avoid neither can the faith of those that be elect fail total or final the visible church have in itself two different sort of people the one make a outward bare profession only the other by inward election be firm join unto Christ the first be in the visible church alone but not of the church invisible they participate in the outward sacrament of Christ but not with the inward blessing of Christ and so they may fall away they may be in the church but not of the church they which be inward couple to Christ by his election and holy spirit can fall away from Christ and his church so our text teach we their constancy and perseverance if they have be of we they will have continue with we the outward joint and participation may be dissolve for all they be not the Israel of God which be of Israel no many of they be israelite they be among the multitude that be call they be not of the small number that be elect hypocrite and false gospeler may be in the church with we they can be of the church they be like summer fruit they hold not out they continue not on the other side they that be of we they continue with we after they be matriculate and have their name register in the holy roll of the church they do not revolt but be establish all that the father give i shall come to i and he that come unto i I cast not away the counsel of the lord endure for ever say saint how do the lord counsel endure for ever but in we who he have see and predestinate who can take away God his predestination before the foundation of the world he do foresee we he make we he reform we he send unto we he redeem we this counsel of the lord abide for ever this thought of the almighty remain throughout all age behold the ground and certainty of their faith mark how they which be inward couple to Christ and his church can fall away from the one or the other for Christ say none can take they out of his hand another reason be express in the same place my father which give they to i be great than all and none be able to take they out of my father hand these reason be not good if they may fall away from Christ which be inward couple to he for then Christ and his father must be weak than he that do take they out of their hand and that be a blasphemy worthy to be detest if faith can fail the elect may perish for without faith it be impossible to please God but our saviour Christ do testify that it be not possible that the elect shall perish and therefore their faith can fail if their faith can fail the elect shall be regenerate often but the elect be bear of incorruptible seed and as the seed be so must the generation also be incorruptible to that purpose s. John write he that be bear of God sin not neither can he because the seed of God abide in he how shall faith be variable that have God his promise I will put my fear in their heart that they shall not go from i if God will not have his to fall away how shall they fail if he will put his fear into their heart that they shall not fail how can they lose that fear no no. beside that they have a further preservative namely the efficacy of Christ his prayer keep they in thy truth joh. 17 again I have pray for thou that thy faith do not fail luc. 22. the mountain shall remove and the hill shall fall down but my mercy shall not depart from thou neither shall the covenant of my peace fall away say the lord Isaiah 54. joh. 15. you have not choose i but I have choose you and ordain you that you go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit remain if Christ have ordain that their fruit shall remain who dare say that it shall not remain rom. 11. the gift and grace of God be without repentance of David faith of Peter and other that fall into enormous sin I say with their faith begin to wither but it wither not it be move but not remove it be shake but not extinguish the grace of faith and the holy ghost may be and be often lose even of they that be regenerate in part concern some certain gift more or less but can be lose whole because the lord reserve a seed in they for example David lose the rightness of heart and integrity of spirit when he fall into his foul sin of adultery and murder yet be he not bereave of these whole for than he can not have pray for restitution unto they how shall they call upon he in who they have not believe mark then in David that seed which s. John say be leave oh the unsearchable riches of our god his goodness and mercy that reserve a seed of regeneration in our most heavy and sad downfall for except the lord of host have leave this seed we shall all have be as Sodom and as Gomorra Theophilact write to the like purpose of Peter upon luc. 22. although Peter thou shall find a concussion for a while yet have thou the seed of faith leave within thou although the breath of the tempter shake down some leaf of thy faith yet the root hold life and thy faith shall not fail will you see a lively representation or spectacle hereof look upon the same man the same Peter mat. 14. when he be walk unto Christ upon the sea and trample down the proud wave thereof with his foot he begin to be drown in that haughty enterprise but Christ reach out a hand unto he hold he up bless be that sweet that comfortable that helpful and healthful hand of jesus Christ which be reach out to we all in our several necessity and so to conclude this point with sensible divinity which most of we that observe it have experience of though our faith be often shake as Peter be with our own infirmity yet it stand fast by the mercy of God in Christ he see no iniquity in jacob nor transgression in Israel or if he look upon it he behold all the item and obligation thereof cancel and fasten to the cross of his son so as indeed there be no condemnation leave to they that be in jesus Christ 2. cor. 4.8 we be afflict on every side yet be we not in distress we be in doubt but we despair not we be persecute but not forsake cast down but we perish not Hieronym epist. Rusticum nothing more happy than a christian because he have promise of the kingdom of heaven nothing more painful because he run in hazard of his life every day nothing more valiant because he overcome the devil nothing more feeble because he be vanquish by his own flesh this sum be that we have a great treasure give unto we of God in faith and believe his promise but we carry this treasure in earthen vessel subject to many knock let we therefore work out our salvation with fear and tremble first by distrust our own ability and attribute all to God through jesus Christ second in believe his promise therein so we shall be humble in ourselves with fear and tremble yet confident in God which work all in we both to will and to perform when we be weak he be strong and out of our weakness bring forth his own power he predestinate we to be of his family by his eternal counsel enroll we by our baptism call we by his holy word nourish we with the body and blood of his son jesus Christ seal and confirm we to constancy by the effectual operation of his bless spirit and so those which revolt from we in these band what outward show soever they make of catholic yet be they not of the true church but so persist they have no portion no right no memorial in jerusalem howbeit let we pray the father (@) lord jesus Christ to take away the va (...) ^s lay (@) their heart to the intent (...) red together into one fold to (@) ^hip to ^^^fesse to call upon father son and holy ghost three person and one God praise and magnify in the church throughout all generation amen
