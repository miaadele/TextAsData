thereto than that of the prelate the truth hereof will appear unto your in case you shall be please to take knowledge in particular of the opinion and proceed hold by the prelate of this your realm on the one side and by we the petitioner for the say toleration on the other whereas the state of england be free inty and independent hold immediate from the lord of heaven each office and ministry aswell in the church as the commonwealth and not derive it either in whole or in part from any foreign potentate and governor on earth it may please your master to examine whether we your most humble

state of england or the prelate who hold their office and ministerle to be essential derive and confer upon they not by any authority domestical and proper to the state but by virtue of such ordination as be convey to their predecessor from the church of rome wherein as the say prelate do cast a apparent blemish and dishonour upon the gospel profess by your master and your people as if from and by the mean of antichrist the church of christ shall receive the assurance and warrant of their ministry and consequent of their faith and celestial inheritance so do they in this particular disclaim the sovereign absoluteness and independency of the state wherein they live and make both your majesty and themselves tie in regard of their say ministry so receive to acknowledge some obligation and homage to the sea of rome we not find either in the doctrine propound in the gospel or in the practice observe by the apostle in the church plant by they any warrant for provincial or diocesan bishop do hold their function and call to be mere humane institution and therefore that it be in your majesty power to remove they from out your dominion and to confine they to Rome or toledo and this be the judgement of the prelate and clergy in the day of king henry the 8. as may appear by a treatise entitle the institution of a christian man publish and dedicate to the say king this also be the opinion of this whole state in the time of king edw 6. and since of the late most worthy queen yea of archbishop preface page 2 pa. 8^ ^17 372 whitegift likewise and r. hooker who spare

derive the title and birth of their function and dignity from christ and his apostle by the interpose of the pope and church of room do absolute deny unto your master the say power and so abridge you in a high point of your supremacy do intercept and defalk a prerogative annex to your crown whereas we the say minister hold that the prelate both provincial and diocesan ought accord to the 1. eward 6. cap 12. item 1. jacobi cap 25. statute provide in that behalf to derive by virtue of letter patent their episcopal jurisdiction and authority of keep court and send forth process from and in the name and under the seal of arm of your highness and successor they the say prelate on the contrary have recourse to provincial and diocesan deans and chapter for this their employment and do in their own name keep court send forth process and execute other part of jurisdiction ecclesiastical wherein whether they encounter not your master sovereignty prerogative and law we humble leave unto you to be consider we the say minister take it as a certain and uncontrollable maxim that it rest in your master to dispose of the temporality of the church this be the judgement of that worthy john wall histor r. 2. wickliff and the emperor frederick can say catal test in frederic nocen for the do whereof he may seem to have receive encouragement from Ambros auxent ambrose who approve this course and from a certain decret p. 2. cause 11. q 1. c 27. canon agree in judgement with ambrose but the say admonit against mar tin marprelat prelate account it a piece of sacrilege to have draw and resume from they and their state what have be confer upon they will not allow unto your this regal power we the say minister keep ourselves within the limit of our function ecclesiastical whole refuse all public civil office and government whereas the prelate disband themselves as it be from out the compass assign unto they do rank their person with and before temporal lord and join in commission for the manage of state affair with the nobility and gentry of the realm so far forth as they make no scruple and difficulty to profess that in case by your master and the state they shall be discharge and seclude from all civil power and office as person incapable thereof you shall thereby do unto they a manifest wrong and expose the church to the hazard of ruin wherein as they great prejudice your imperial crown so they offer no mean indignity and injury to the temporal state by intercept and feaze upon the magistracy and charge which be the proper right and interest of the nobility and gentry and do likewise work a extraordinary impeachment and hurt to the public good of your high person government and kingdom by withdraw their personal endeavour and care from inform your subject in the duty of obedience to god and your master we hold that all officer and minister of the gospel ought to be subject to your high and to all and every your subordinate civil magistrate and that the civil magistrate only aught to be the overseer of province and diocese and of the several church therein and that it be a duty enjoin they by god and which your master shall by way of commission impose upon the nobility and gentry in the several county of your kingdom namely to sit in commission and to take notice of all misgovernment in person ecclesiastic commit either in the course of their life or teach and so to proceed accord to censure and redress but the prelate will not allow unto your master this point of regal supremacy they can thus subject and abase themselves they must be some of they great primate some county palatine most of they commissioner for the peace all of they of a eminent authority and power within their proper diocese so as for person of their rank and quality to be subject to the proceed and censure of such as in every several county carry the sword and authority civil under your be hold by they no less intolerable then for a counseller of state to be subject to a petty constable or borsholder as we hold that your master within your dominion have power to call synod and to dissolve they so we hold likewise that rule synod and unite presbytery exercise government and impose law and decree upon several church and the pastor of they be not only humane institution but in regard of the say government and authority of impose law altogether unlawful and usurp upon the supremacy of the civil magistrate protest of the king supreme page 4. sect 8. in who power only it rest to enact and ordain law ecclesiastical for and over all the church within his dominion and therefore they be not desire by we as a mean either to curb and force the civil magistrate a course abhor by we and utter repugnant to our profession and practice or to procure countenance and respect to our ministerial function among other we acknowledge as have be above remember no other power and authority for the overseeing rule and censure of particular church how many soever in number in the case of their misgovernment they that which be original invest in your royal person and from it derive to such of your laity as you shall judge worthy to be depute to the execution of the same under you so as the favour humble solicit by we be that whereas our lord jesu have give to each particular church or ordinary congregation this right and privilege viz. to elect ordain and deprive she own minister and to exercise all other part of lawful ecclesiastical jurisdiction under he your master will be please to take order aswell that each particular church that shall be allow to partake in the benefit of the say toleration may have enjoy and put in execution and practise this her say right and privilege as that some your subaltern civil officer may be appoint by you to demand and receive of each church a dew and just account of their proceed here we do humble entreat that we may not be so interpret as if we disclaim all sort of synod it be the rule and not the deliberative and persuasive synod which we except against that a synod shall enjoin we to receive and entertain a constitution enact by themselves we hold it unlawful to be move thereto by way of persuasion ground upon a clear demonstration of utility and advantage grow thereby to the church we do in no sort dislike how far in this question of synod the prelate do dissent from we both touch opinion and practice it can be unknown to any who be in any measure acquaint with the carriage of church affair they the say prelate for the whitegift page 436. call of synod maintain the necessity of the office of a archbishop Bish of lincol in his answ to a catho page 170. they assume to themselves the power of enact law and leave to your master a bare command for the execution of they the synod hold by they be of a large extent their authority reach from dan to beersheba from dover in kent to the mount in cornwall and be withal of such power and ready execution as where their canon and decree encounter contradiction there they proceed to the extreme censure they employ their apparitor to cite and command appearance they imprison they deprive they degrade they excommunicate they anathematise here we appeal to your master humble beseech you to consider whether the prelate who spiritual arm be of a exorbitant strength and reach from the east of your kingdom to the west thereof and be able in sort to curb your nobility and gentry or we the minister solicit reformation who power be bound within the limit of a poor parish and subject to the authority and controlment of any your mean commissioner for the peace do exercise a jurisdiction and government most compatible with your imperial sceptre it may please you to examine and weigh in your princely apprehension and thought to who the title and name of pope so often object by our adversary to a parish pastor may with best reason be appropriate whether to a poor minister who of himself and without assistance from other stand disable for matter of jurisdiction and when he have out of a concurrence from his colleague with he a authority to proceed judicial yet can make it obligatory and of validity otherwise then with the consent and within the proper precinct of his particular congregation or to a prelate who rule alone without check and who power of jurisdiction be not only spiritual but also civil and not confine to a parish but extend to whole diocese and province if your master shall think meet for the clear of this point of the appropriation of the title and name of pope or popel to rely upon the judgement of your great prelate you may ready be satisfy and resolve herein for they have by the mouth of Dr downame preach at lambeth in favour and defence of episcopal pre-eminence and authority conclude and since under special allowance divulge and recommend to the world this theological and undoubted maxim viz. that a minister have supreme and sole authority in the church and cause ecclesiastical or rule alone without controlment and not subject to the authority of a diocesan or provincial bishop rule as a pope the application of this maxim we humble leave to your majesty last whereas by their canon they cross the equal and proportionable distribution of justice enjoin by the law of the land in that they censure some enormous crime light and impose a severe punishment on some carriage that in the judgement of the law of god and of this realm either run not in the account of a crime or be in the nature of a light transgression and whereas by the 53. canon they take from the subject the liberty grant he by law divine and humane to deliver his opinion in a controvert point of religion and likewise by another canon 98 canon all benefit of appeal allow by the law of this kingdom and whereas also they excommunicate such as canon 139. deny the convocation to be the representative church of the true church of god within england which say church be in the true sense and intendment of our law judge to consist not only of the clergy but of the king nobility and commons we do in all hum litie beseech your master to consider whether the say prelate do in these several point proceed with due regard unto your master and the state now forasmuch as the say prelate by derive their office and ministry from the foreign power of the church of rome by deny unto your the authority of remove and abrogate the function of diocesan and provincial bishop by execute jurisdiction episcopal in their own name and under their own seal of arm contrary to the express letter of the statute provide in that behalf by account it sacrilege that your high shall by your regal authority dispose of the temporalty of the church by usurp and manage civil office and so withdraw themselves from inform your subject in the duty of obedience to god and your by exempt their person in regard of their eminent dignity and charge both in church and common wealth from under the jurisdiction and power of your subordinate civil magistrate by draw into use rule synod such namely as who power be extendable to the utmost confine of this your kingdom and over such your subject as be aswell of a noble rank and quality as of a mean degree and condition by take and assume to themselves the power of enact law ecclesiastical and leave to your master a bare command only to see they execute forasmuch as the say prelate do by these their proceed ground upon opinion in they answerable thereto not a little disadvantage your master in the point of your regal power and sovereignty we do in all humbleness entreat that the consideration hereof may plead with your high in favour of we the say minister who neither hold in opinion nor entertain in practise any matter either prejudicial to your royal state supremacy and prerogative as our adversary do or partake of confusion grow from the root of that accurse parity which encounter the subordination of officer which we agreeable to the word of truth do maintain to be of as necessary and worthy use in the body of christ as in a body natural in which all member be not eye or head or hand but one be a head another be a hand etc so in the body of christ one be pastor another teacher other elder other deacon etc and yet we disclaim not such equality as betwixt distinct and separate church the spirit of all wisdom have institute and recommend it be in they as they be with respect of the one to the other consider no more a incongruity or disproportion than parity in eminency and power betwixt the several king and kingdom of europe as it will be a matter of infinite harshness and of perilous sequel to sovereign prince if one among they shall seize upon the peculiar sovereignty of each and so intercept that parity in sceptre and government which the prince of prince have betwixt they respective ordain so can it not succeed otherwise in the case of distinct church when that power which be proper to each by divine institution shall be transfer and link upon one this primacy in power of one pastor and church over the rest in the same kingdom will where there be of arch prelate sundry and distinct sea be hardly with patience endure by they with we the arch-prelates of canterbury and york in france of rheims and lyons in germany of coleyn and mentz can well brook some subjection to their several prince but a subordination of york to canterbury of rheims to lyons of coleyn to mentz will happy prove in the stomach of dainty prelate a matter of such crudity and indigestion as that subordination will be hold by they the mother of confusion and parity magnify as the author of excellent beauty and grace in the church for a further inducement to your master in this behalf we be bold to add hereunto that it stand with policy and reason of state to allow the toleration and exemption desire by us but here we do humble beseech your master not to think that by our suit for the say toleration we make a overture and way for toleration unto papist our suit be of a different nature from they and the inducement thereof such as can conclude aught in favour of they who head be antichrist who worship be idolatry who doctrine be heresy and a profession direct contrary to the lawful state and government of free country and kingdom as your master have true and judicious observe as we do not herein give advantage unto papist so do we not by way of separation disclay i communion with such church among we as in opinion of ecclesiastical regiment differ from we be ready to communicate with they in the lord worship when without personal and voluntary participation in sin we may do the same for your satisfaction then in this point vouchsafe we most mighty and noble prince this princely equity and patience as to be inform of that which we do here present may it therefore please your master in the first place to be remember that it be suitable with the wise proceed of worthy king for the reduce of partiality and trouble in their state to a peaceable issue to draw into practice that expedient and mean which former experience have prove to be of worthy use to this purpose if a prince shall make question hereof the physician and navigator can resolve he herein the one be in his cure the other in sail ever hold that course which observation and trial have discover to be fit and serviceable to the end they aim at that the say toleration be for pacify contention in the matter of religion profess by we a ready mean may appear hereby in that it remove both the original cause and nourishment thereof and in that it have be for this excellent service entertain by great monarch and potentate both in ancient time and of late year upon this ground do the roman empetour surcease their persecution of the christian grant unto they the liberty not only to serve the lord jesu accord to the holy ordinance prescribe by he but to erect also for the better accomplishment thereof convenient building and place upon this ground do athenagoras in his apology persuade the emperor commodus thereto there have not yet pass much more than half a age since charles the five a prince of deep and politic reach permit unto those in germany who he have for the cause of religion pursue with arm as the fit mean of pacification the free use of the profession embrace by they herein be charles a worthy pattern and precedent to maximilian the emperor who at vienna and in the city descend unto he by inheritance be out of the rule of policy well please to yield entertainment to that religion which himself regard not it be know to sundry yet live that the french king henry the three when he be to receive the crown of poland notwithstanding his zeal to the church of room condescend to the observation and practice in that kingdom of the whole doctrine propound in the write of the evangelist and apostle comment relig and reip henr 3.5 part lib 14. in the time of the say henry the three when the prince of condy and other protestant of note and dignity confederate with he become suitor for toleration of religion it be worthy to be consider what course be hold by emanuel duke of savoy be draw to mediate with the say king in furtherance of the protestant suit though he the say duke acknowledge all service and devotion to that romish and antichristian sea yet in the instruction deliver by he to his servant molarius who for the purpose aforesaid he address into france he express charge he to plead with all earnestness for the grant of toleration to the protestant and not only to propound unto the king the example of the course hold by he the say prince for tolerate the introduction and exercise of religion in sundry part of savoy but likewise to advertise he of the advantage and good success he the say duke have in his particular experience discern and find of the toleration allow by he and not satisfy herewith he further enjoin molarius to treat in all serious manner with the ambassador send from the popish canton in zuitserland that they likewise will urge and recommend unto the french king the cause of toleration at the same time it please the late queen elizabeth of happy memory by her ambassador d. dale to negotiate with the say king a pacification in the behalf of the protestant and to press as a special and worthy remedy of the present trouble a grant on the king part of liberty for they to profess in public and with security to their person honour and good the religion like and follow by they this course of toleration be hold by henry the four now reign in france by the present emperor in diverse part of his territory by the king of poland and allow off by the spaniard in his late treaty with the state of holland and other the unite province the liberty of the gospel and the free exercise of every part thereof both for doctrine and government be observe to be of so harmless and peaceable a nature and carriage and so far from wrong any monarch in his sovereignty and public interest that the very heathen the persian namely and the turk give passage and entertainment thereunto what advantage the prince above name do receive thereby to the assure of their sceptre and to the advancement of the common good and honour of their estate the same oh mighty prince may your may reap with the addition of a great glory to your person as the grant of toleration persuade by we be accompany with this unvaluable effect of give end to controversy and dissension in a state such as issue from difference in opinion touch point of our religion so in case your master shall be please to condescend thereunto it will be find not unworthy the entertain for matter of commodity for whereas the prelate by their court and their officer and such proceed as they observe likewise in private do yearly without all warrant from the word of god draw from the subject no less a proportion then a subsidy or two amount unto and so disable the subject to furnish the ordinary payment and contribution of state if it shall be judge meet by your high to honour the people under your government with so gracious a privilege as that so many of they as relish the reformation urge by we may be exempt from the power of the rochet and crozier and allow to live under the government and holy ordinance of the lord jesu which will and aught to be in each part of the kingdom free and without charge administer to the people it will fall out that how much be defalk and withdraw from the court of the prelate and intercept from the finger of their officer so much be reserve in the purse of the subject whereby to inhable he for your of what advantage and consequence this may grow to be to your imperial crown and dignity and of what comfort and satisfaction to your people now a long time harass and weary by chancellor Commissary archdeacon apparitor and other of this trade and mystery we humble pray to be examine further we do in all submissive sort beseech your master to call to mind and to weigh in your most wise and grave deliberation whether it be not agreeable with the rule of sound policy that each constitution and establish order in a state shall sort and correspond with the nature and disposition of the people live therein the great politics have ever hold it for a principle undoubted and observable if your master likewise shall so apprehend thereof may it please you they to consider what correspondence the canon and constitution pontifical now in force against we the say minister and other your loyal subject have with the nature and quality of a great part of the people within the church of england it be not unknown that partly by the powerful ministry of the gospel partly by the plot and attempt on the part of the romanists for supplant the gospel and the professor thereof many thousand of your people be wrought to a special distaste of such constitution and order of the prelate whereby both the faithful minister of the gospel be in all disgracive and unworthy sort in regard of their inconformity to popish rite and ceremony discard and remove from be any long the lord sentinel and watchman and the people also either force to honour and approve by their presence and practise some the devise and institution of the romish synagogue leave among we in the worship of the lord or draw into question in the case of refusal to their extraordinary trouble and expense if then to no mean a multitude of your most dutiful and love subject the say constitution and canon be for the respect above mention as a dose of wormwood and gall we beseech you in your royal wisdom to consider whether it suit not with the reason of state to limit and restrain the execution of they and so to regard your people that they may be discharge of all obligation on this behalf and allow in the service of the almighty not to borrow aught from their swear and capital adversary the idolater of room but to entertain the ordinance enact by christ and his apostle and whereas a prince be by virtue of his regal function and office tie to distribute in equal and proportionable sort the testimony of his love and care to the good of his people it may please your master to debate with your royal self first whether it stand with the receive axiom of policy to yield respect countenance and support to one part of your people under your government and to suffer the other who be no less if not more loyal than the former and who endeavour have be and be of excellent use and service for the advancement of the gospel to rest expose to unmerciful censure and disgrace and second whether a proceed of this nature and upon this ground of inconformity with room in her outward and ceremonial carriage accompany with a reproach in a high degree will not disaffect and discourage the subject which in all hearty and affectionate sort we desire of the lord may never happen though not in the point of loyalty yet in the cheerful course of duty to his prince if now your master shall discover that the say proceed may through the continuance thereof fall out which we trust shall never and pray that it may not to be of special inconvenience and disadvantage unto you in regard of the say discouragement and disaffection it may raise in the heart of some your people and that it be a error in policy for a prince to carry a unproportionable and partial hand towards those who in matter which concern the gospel and the lord worship be equal to communicate in the demonstration and pledge of his favour it may then please your excellent master if you find it to be your own cafe to deliberate of redress in this behalf and to afford the lord that honour your self that right your people that contentement and comfort as to confine and limit the jurisdiction of the prelate that it extend not to those who approve reformation but that they may in the service of the lord jesu be suffer to observe the order and constitution enact by he moreover if no reason of state will allow the continuance of that course which be special affect and like by our extreeme enemy as be of great advantage unto they in the peril and hurt it work to the church of this kingdom and to the profession of the gospel embrace by they and if common sense and experience will advertise we that the entertain of those proceed and practise which be most distaste by our adversary as be ready mean to frustrate their hope will best assure we against their project and design than we presume your master will call to mind how much it import you both to command a surcease on the prelate part of execute their authority in the silence and deprivation of their fellow-servaunts the faithful minister of the gospel and likewise to take order that the relic of antichrist which have give life and growth to the partiality and faction among we be displant and remove the holy ordinance only of our bless redeemer and king may by way of toleration receive passage and admittance into some church to be gather by your special grace in some part of this kingdom that the course hold by the prelate against reformation and the minister urge the same be of a excellent relish in the taste of the papist as the papist themselves will ready acknowledge so the particulate of the effect issue thereon will evident convince what be more please and of great contentement to a romanist than the disgrace and silence of he who labour the subversion of the doctrine and sea of rome when he shall withal discern that by occasion of the say course many student of worthy part do stay and divert themselves from employment in the ministry that there be nourish and feed in romish catholic at home and abroad a special hope of restore popery to her former reputation among we that there be raise much spleen betwixt the laborer in the lord harvest much harshenes betwixt the several favourer of either opinion much disorder and dissolution of life that there be a opportunity present unto priest and jesuit for passage hither and to negotiate a reconcilement to the church of rome when a romanist i say shall discern this effect and issue of the say course pontifical will it not cheer and refresh his daunt spirit will it not occasion he to chant a in regard thereof that the course solicit by we the say minister be detest by the romanists and that it be able to furnish unto a prince the mean of disappoint their hope and of secure his state against their plot and attempt if it need for the evidence thereof any further discourse we can not only clear it by lay forth the admirable power and fruit of the lord sacred ordinance practise in form and manner as be prescribe in the word but verify it also out of example and experience if we shall by way of instance name only unto your master your kingdom of england and scotland none know so exact as your noble self the malice conceive by romanists against the gospel and the security yield to your person and crown by the free and sincere exercise thereof see then the free exercise of the gospel in sort as be desire be a mean to assure your sceptre imperial against the conspiracy of your capital and great adversary the admirer of that roman archpriest and his triple crown and sith the say course hold by the bishop be in regard aswell of the manifold hurt grow thereby to the church of this realm as of the sundry advantage rise therefrom to the synagogue of room exceed approve and affect by your say adversary we hope your master will call into deliberation this worthy admonition desis hostide and so resolve to give we contentment in this our just suit for your majesty further inducement whereto let it not be unpleasing unto you to have it represent to your memory that where there be two faction the weaken of the one be the strengthen of the other there be within this your kingdom a faction of romanists for number strength dependency at home and abroad not to be contemn for watchfulness and readiness to take the advantage of all occurrent and time not unworthy to be careful eye and observe for malice to the gospel and the professor thereof unsatiable for desire and secret endeavour to reestablish the authority of saint t peters chair among we most affectionate now this faction can not but grow so much the more ranforce and potent by how much the protestant party shall be enfeeble and lessen and the protestant party can not but diminish and languish in case the aforesaid course of the prelate be continue for what hinder the gain of great number to the side of the gospel that must of necessity impair and distrengthen the same side if it shall be in favour of the prelate reply that no action can lie against they for any such regard of hindrance give to the win and add of any to the church it may please your master to remember that when the ordinary mean fail of gain to the true church of christ the act of gain number thereto must determine but by pursue the course pontifical aforesaid the ordinary mean of conversion from blindness and infidelity to the knowledge and faith of the gospel be and have be interrupt and cross not only in that humane ordinance in the lord worship receive special entertainment among we and popery find favour for vent and disperse her infection in discourse from abroad and in sermon sometime from our pulpit at home but likewise in that so many worthy light have thereby be remove from shine in the church so many able and well qualify student discourage from hold place and office therein so many of good wit and spirit keep from the university and dispose of to mechanical employment and so many fit to labour in the vineyard of gascon then in the harvest of the lord obtrude to the church for in and desperate if then the say course pontifical work in the party embrace the gospel a decay of strength and consequent a further vigour and spirit in the opposite faction we hope it will be judge agreeable with the rule of wisdom by grant of the toleration desire to prevent the decay of the one and to encounter the rise and growth of the other beside if a surcease of urge conformity and subscription be for cure the disease of partiality and contention in the church of this kingdom altogether needful then can there not against the toleration solicit by we any just exception be take the real use and practice of the lord ordinance in his public worship for the guide of his church be of as great necessity as the disuse and rejection of humane devise and romish formality in the same that the present conformity and subscription shall in politic discourse and reason determine and not further be press this consideration do admonish we namely that when the remedy prepare to cure the disease of the state do in the application thereof augment and strengthen the malady we ought to forbear all further recourse to the say remedy of this nature and effect we find the urge of the say conformity and subscription to be we be not ignorant that it be suggest unto your master that for silence of dissension in the church the silence of inconformitans be a admirable and present mean but the observe experience of sundry year under your master and your predecessor q. elizabeth do witness and proclaim to the world that for free the church from the sickness of division and faction the urge of the say conformity be no receipt of any sovereign virtue in that behalf it have we see be often administer by the prelate and their serviceable apothecary but ever with no better success than a unseasonable medicine which do exasperate and not temper the humour as therefore physician do quiet so in the cure of infirmity and distemper of the state the admonition of moecenas to augustus be

course that will daunt the enemy of his state and religion and discourage they from practice and attempt against the same no prince know so accurate as your master now whether the say toleration be not a course of this consequence and power it may please your high to dispute with your most noble self the less hope your profess adversary shall discern of subvert the gospel and of re-advancing popery among we so much the more will they grow disharted and unspirited for matter of project and conspiracy against your person and throne but the more our church be purge from romish tradition and relic and the more ground the gospel win upon antichrist by the vigilant and careful endeavour of the minister thereof two worthy effect accompany the say toleration so much the less hope will the enemy of your religion and state conceive of prevail against the one and the other and for that regard if it shall under your royal approbation and protection be lawful for we to worship and honour the lord jesu accord to the direction only leave in his holy word and after the manner observe in the reform church which have so far proceed in their separation from room that they hold with it no communion either in the proper doctrine of that sea or in the constitution rite and formality of the same we trust that the lord jesu in the behalf of who kingdom we be humble suitor will so honour this your master grant of the say toleration that antichrist with the whole party of his favourite and adherent will out of despair renounce and disclaim all further plot and attempt either against the kingdom of the gospel or against your crown and dignity if the defect of toleration and the hold of the say course prelatical be a mean to abridge your master in the number of your serviceable and faithful subject in the multitude of who consist the strength and glory of a prince proverb 14 28. and among who the loss even of one ought to be precious in your sight and withal to cast upon the government of the church of the lord jesu within this your kingdom a double blemish and imputation the one that it be fashion not accord to the pattern show to the true prophet in the mount but accord to the mould of the false prophet sit on the 7. hill the other that it hold a proceed of much sharpness and rigour aswell for the silence and remove from out the church no mean number of the worthy pastor within this land as for the disgrace and traduce of many thousand otherwise of your master most loyal and best affect subject in regard of their affection to the reformation desire may it then please your excellent master to draw under the examination of your most politic and religious thought what we do here propound and to deliberate with your noble heart serious and unpartial whether to prevent the inconvenience now particulate and charge upon the say course pontifical and the want of the say toleration it answer not the true principle of wisdom to condescend unto our just and most dutiful request consider that it be enjoin to prince by the prince of heaven and earth both to prize as a singular blessing the multitude of faithful subject and so far to regard the honour of his holy name in the government of his church as not to give cause of public obloquy and reproach thereto if we shall impute to the defect of toleration and to the say course pontifical the inconvenience above remember we shall we trust offer to the prelate no wrong in that behalf for we do already see that out of a care to worship the lord accord to his word and detestation to the rag and bage of popery which be as yet with the scandalize of the lord people and with the confirm of the romanist in his love to a foreign priest and in his disloyalty to your master retain after a zealous sort in our church sundry your high subject have actual quit the realm that many other upon the same ground do perform as some in wish and desire some in purpose and determination be not improbable that it be in the nature and reach of the say course hold by the prelate to strip your master of the use and service of many thousand of your most affectionate and devote subject may hereby appear in that the prelate have or pretend to have power of excommunicate and imprison not some few but all such as shall refuse the oath can 3.4.5.6.7.8 27.139 disclaim kneel at the sacrament deny the convocation to be the true representative church of christ within this land give no allowance to all and every part of the liturgy withstand conformity and subscription affirm that the minister can yield to all these thing with a good conscience etc the authority then of the say prelate be of this extent incase it shall be draw into execution against so many of your master subject as be liable to their censure in regard of the above name and suppose offence and other transgression iudiciable in their court the hold and prison already design within this realm to the personal restraint of delinquent though they be for number double or treble yet will not be capable of so great a multitude as shall be sentence thereunto and do not a prisoner during the time of his imprisonment rest disable for the service of his prince if for the time he stand in the account of a person unserviceable and as it be dead to the crown and state then if the say pontifical course shall real and without partiality be execute it will in a measure sufferable abridge your master in the number of your serviceable and love subject touch the imputation and dishonour whereto the regiment of the church of the lord jesu among we be by the say course prelatical expose for the justify hereof we appeal first to the judgement of all the reform church in foreign part and second to the papist themselves the reform church namely those who have purge the lord public worship from the pollution of antichrist in far great measure than we have do and be grow into a hatred of his devise and trash can if they will be true to their own principle and suitable in their proceed but condemn for romish and antichristian what be from out the synagogue of priest and jesuit transport into the holy congregation of our saviour christ they can but deplore the indignity and wrong offer to the church of god among we in the person of those worthy and learned minister who be for their love to reformation and for their unconformity to the rite and observance of room silence deprive and after a extraordinary manner traduce and disgrace yea in the letter and intendment of the canon excommunicate and anathematize they can but brand this proceed with the mark of unusual rigour such as whereof no age can give a instance as use by the true professor of the gospel against their brethren and fellow-servant in the work of the ministry upon this ground and pretext of the say unconformity thus must the reform church charge and censure the say prelatical course or pass sentence against themselves and as for the romanists do they not applaud the hold of the say course by the prelate be it not a matter of excellent contentement to their soul that the churchgovernement of rome and sundry of the outward and proper formality thereof shall be honour in our church and the impugner of the same and seeker of reformation in this behalf pursue with reproach imprisonment excommunication and ruin in their whole estate if the romanists the capital enemy of your imperial crown and of the gospel profess by yourself and your subject do thus exalt and triumph in behold the proceed on the part of our prelate for the support of the romish church-government and the appendant thereto and for the extirpation of such as solicit the displant and remove thereof do not this their triumph proclaim to the world aswell our ready and profess concurrence with they in their ecclesiastical tradition and regiment as their approbation of the rigorous measure and vexation offer unto we and can there be a great reproach and imputation throw upon the government and officer of our church then that we shall concur both in the one and the other with the fashion of egypt and babylon that the one and the other shall be condemn by the sincere professor of christ and commend by the follower of antichrist censure by our best friend and approve by our great enemy if then the defect of toleration and the hold of the say course pontifical doe in the nature and reach of the canon in case they be real and unpartial execute aswell extraordinary prejudice your crown and dignity in take from your master the use and service of so many thousand your most loyal subject as expose the government of the church under you to much imputation and dishonour it may please you to remember how answerable your master shall proceed to the maxim of true policy in case you take order by the grant of the say toleration for the prevention and redress of the abovementioned inconvenience whereto we hope your master will be the rather induce when you shall consider that the best reform church of europe entertain in opinion and practise the cause for which we suffer be by the prelate in our person and through our side wound and censure with all reproach yea pursue with suspension degradation imprisonment excommunication and anathema hitherto we have in all humility and reverence offer to your princely view and consideration as plead with your master in favour of we two important argument the one show that the church constitution and government solicit by we do better sort with your imperial crown then the government of the prelate the other that it stand with the reason of state to allow the toleration desire by us we be now in the three and last place most humble to beseech your master that you will vouchsafe to take notice of the vexation and rigorous measure offer unto we by the prelate our purpose be not to enter into particularity but to present your master in brief with a general taste and view thereof so far as it may serve for some inducement to procure from your royal heart a commiseration of us the indignity and wrong we have receive from the say prelate be manifold and of a high nature they have not spare to wrong we in our soul and conscience in our calling and function in our body in our good and live in our good name and credit in our write and discourse of which some they enlarge with addition for the grace of their cause some they shorten and dismember for the conceal of the truth the wrong we have receive in our soul and conscience do in part discover itself hereby in that some upon vehement urge on the part of the bishop of subscription and conformity have in the end yield thereto have within few day after upon a more serious conference with their own conscience discern their error and miscarriage
