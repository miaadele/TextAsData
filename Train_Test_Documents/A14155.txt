A SONG OF DEGREES. A PSALME OF DAVIDS.



PSALME 124.

VERS. 1. If the Lord had not beene on our side (may Israel now say.)
2. If the Lord had not beene on our side, when men rose vp against vs.
3. They had then swallowed vs vp quicke, when their wrath was kindled against vs.
4. Then the waters had drowned vs, and the streame had gone ouer our soules.
5. Then had the swelling waters gone ouer our soule.
6. Praised be the Lord, which hath not giuen vs as a pray vnto their teeth.
7. Our soule is escaped, euen as a bird out of the snare of the Fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are deliuered.
8. Our helpe is in the name of the Lord, which hath made heauen and earth.


TO enter into a discourse concerning the title of this Psalme [A Song of Degrees] common to the foure Psalmes immediately going before this, and to the ten ensuing after; were (as I suppose) more easie to obserue the varietie of opinions old and new, then to come to a knowledge of the truth therein.

The Iewish RabbinsCaluin. and Jacob. de Valent. (whose manner is, when matters are obscure, like Painters and Poets, to come and faine any thing) obserue, that there were fifteene steps or degrees, in a part of the Temple, appointed for men; when women had their place below: to which fifteene steps, these fifteene Psalmes of degrees had a reference.Luther. Others thinke they were so called, because they were wont to be sung by the Priests and Leuites, vpon certaine steps and degrees in the Temple, as on a higher place, that they might be the better heard by the people. Of such steps and degrees, there is mention made, in the like case, Nehem. 9. verse 4.Basil. Beza. (...) Some expound them historically, by way of Ascensions, (as the word signifieth) namely, of the children of Israel, ascending vp to Ierusalem, in returning from their captiuitie; to the memorie of which benefit, they were principally consecrated.Basil. Arnobius. Hierome. Augustine. Cassiodorus. Some mystically, of Gods children, profiting in this world of their peregrination, rising from sinne to grace, and ascending by degrees from vertue to vertue, vntill they appeare before God, in the heauenly Ierusalem. In which current, the ancient Fathers run, for the most part.Caluin. Some of an higher tune or note, whereunto they rose, in lifting vp their voices, when they sung them.F^emel and Junius. Last of all, some in regard of the excellencie of that dittie, expounding the word, of excellencies. A song of excellencies, that is, an excellent song, like that Song of Songs, that excellent Song of Salomons.
Howsoeuer, I take it, the matter is not great, nor worthy any curious enquirie after the name, so long as wee agree in the substance and matter of the Psalme: that it is indeed an excellent Psalme, describing in liuely colours the state of Gods Church vpon the earth, so exposed to enemies, as that sometime, like a generall deluge, they are ready to drowne it, vers. 4.5. sometimes like sauage beasts, to teare it in peeces, vers. 6. yea not making any bones of it, to deuoure and swallow it vp quicke at once, vers. 3. sometimes like craftie fowlers, with ginnes and snares to
 entrap it. vers. 7. So malitiously are they bent, so furiouslie are they incensed against it. vers. 3. But that God, who by his power made heauen and earth, and by the same his power, ruleth it still, as best pleaseth him, vers. 8. was euermore at hand, thereby vpholding it; and at one side thereof; and then no matter who is against it. vers. 1.2. Maugre their wrath and malice, they could not preuaile, for they lost their prey, vers. 6. The godly escaped as a bird out of the snare, and were deliuered, vers. 7. What remaineth then, but that the Lord be praised for this their deliuerance. vers. 6. For he was their onely helpe then; and in his holy name they will set vp their rest. vers. 8.
I haue, after my Country manner, briefly analized, and paraphrastically, in few words, deliuered you the sense and meaning of the Prophet in this Psalme: which howsoeuer it spread it selfe like a most fruitfull tree, into many branches; my purpose is, omitting others, to make choice of these points, to insist vpon: 1. The subtiltie of the aduersaries of the Church, in laying snares to entrap it, as fowlers doe to catch birds, out of the 7. verse. 2. Their crueltie, in seeking to teare it in peeces, yea to swallow it vp quicke, as some cruell beasts doe their prey; or, as mighty inundations, ouerflow whatsoeuer commeth in their way, out of the 3.4.5. and 6. verses. 3. The cause producing these effects of subtiltie and crueltie in these aduersaries; namely, their wrath; out of the 3. verse. 4. The deliuerance of the Church from her enemies, notwithstanding their craft and crueltie, by the omnipotent power of almighty God; out of the 1.2.6. and 7. verses. Last of all, the dutie performed for this deliuerance; praise and thanksgiuing to the Lord, verse 6.
1. First therefore of the subtiltie of the enemies of the Church; wherein the holy Prophet likeneth them to fowlers, laying their snares so couertly, shadowed ouer with entising baits, that they draw and allure the silly bird, the
 Church, vntill she be brought within compasse of the net, and so become the fowlers prey.
A wile as ancient as the world is old, and plotted by the father of wiles the Diuell, against the Church, when shee was in her infancie, in Adam and Eue, our first parents in Paradise: whose happinesse in that state of innocencie, and felicitie in a garden of all delightfull pleasures, the enemie of mankinde subuerted, by a trap of more surpassing happinesse in shew; deliuering to the woman the forbidden fruit,Gen 3.5. so canded with the entising hope of Eritis sicut dii, Ye shall be as Gods, that she forgat Lord and Loare, God and his Commandements, taking and eating it, and giuing it to her husband; wrapping him in the same snare with her selfe; whereby, both of them, with all their succeeding posteritie, were made their enemies pray. Whil'st they would be as Gods, they cease to be as men, compared now to the beasts that perish;Psal. 49.12. not continuing in honour, wherein they were created; but inthralled to death, by transgressing the Commandement. Such now is the end of one and all of vs.
The Nimrods and Fowlers of the world (to make good the old prouerbe,Esa. 24 2. Ezek. 16.44. Like Master, like Seruant; and, As the mother is so is the daughter) do heerein resemble the nature of their father the diuell; transforming themselues into all shapes, and laying their ginnes to catch the simple and innocent. Witnesse Ioab, who taking Abner aside, vnder pretence to speake with him peaceably, smote him vnder the fift rib, that he died, 2. Sam. 3.27. And incouraging himselfe in this mischiefe, not long after, hee greeted Amasa with the like salutation, enquiring after his welfare, Art thou in health, my brother? and taking him by the beard with his right hand to kisse him, but with the other, sheathing his sword in his bowels, 2. Sam. 20. vers. 9.10. Iudas his Aue Rabbi, God saue thee, Master, was much like this treacherie; and his kisse, whereby he betraied his Lord into the hands of them that sought his blood, Luc. 22.47.
 So cunningly and as commonly, are the sugred names of friend and Brother, Lord and Maister, made snares for mischiefe, Cum venena Latent circumlita melle verborum,Lib. 3. de sum. bono. ca. 26. whilst the poison (saith Isidore) lyeth hid, spred ouer with the hunnie of sweet words, the imposter making a shew of vertue and honestie, vntil hee get within a man, and fetch him ouer.
For this they learne by experience, as Chrysostome obserueth in a treatise against the Gentiles; that hee which wil deceiue, must set a good face vpon it; and make the matter seeme, at least wise probable; else were they not their crafts-master: for as the commicall Poet saith, doli,Plautus. doli non sunt, in aestu colas, guiles are no guiles, if deceite cloake them not:Chrys. contra gentil. and malum maximum si id palam proueniat; no greater mischiefe then if they bee seene. For therby the pray is lost, and they goe home emptie-handed; as fowlers doe, when the birds espie the net.
But there lyeth the skill, to spread the net, that it appeare not; that the baite hide the hooke: wherin, how wel the aduersaries of our Church haue profited, let the Iesuites of our times testifie for all the rest, whose verie name serueth for nothing else, (as by their practise is euident;) but as Hierom writeth in the like case, fraudem facere,Ad Rusticum. to circumuent vs. So farre are they from that Dooue-like simplicitie; to which, the Lord Iesus (and from whome they would deriue their name,) exhorteth his Disciples, Math. 10. verse 16.
There are that haue branded them with this marke.Iesuits Catac. li. 3. fol. 156. There is not in the world any beast more subtill then is the Iesuite; not the Fox, which Chrysostome in his 19, Sermon describeth thus: Vulpis calliditate Potens, inuentrix doli, fraudis artifex, simulationis magistra, simplicitatis vacua,Mutato nomine, de te fabula narratur. plenastrophis. Change the name and you may render it thus: the Iesuite is a beast, powerfull in craft, an inuentor of guile, the artizen of deceite; maister of fauning, deuoid of simplicitie, and full of wily subtiltie.

For whereunto tendeth it, that one Iesuite must bee called by so many names?Proceedins against he late Traitors. as Garnet that moste treacherous Prouinciall Wallye, alias Darcie, alias Roberts, alias Farmer, alias Philips? Is it not, that going masked vnder so may names, as vnder so many visards hee may the more securely lay his snares to entrap vs? what is their drift in transforming the^selues into as many shapes as they meete with obiects? now a Courtiour, then a Cittizen; heere a countrie Gentleman; there a cou^trie Swaine: sometimes a Seruingma^; a swaggerer, Pot-companion; another while a Priest; in a word euerie man for euerie bodie, a quilibit for a quolibet, a Polipus for all orders and degrees? Is it not, that by this meanes, they may come within men of all sorts; insinuate themselues into their companies; creepe into their bosoms; prie into their hearts; that so they may more easily beguile them vnawares.
But of all their Wiles, I commend vnto you, the Aequiuocating Sibboleth,Iudg. 1.2.6. the verie forge of lying and deceit; which bewraieth them by their speech, to bee no other then false faining Ephraemites. By this they affirme and deny, sweare and forsweare, and all with a breath: they are Priests, and they are no Priests, that is to tell you, they say Masse, and they say not Masse, that is, in Pauls Quier or in Westminster Quier. When they talke with our Magistrates, they speake as to the Walles; for men with them are no men, and all by vertue of this mixt proposition: their Gorgons head, (a point in Logicke which Aristotle neuer taught, and the ancient schooles knew it not) wherby they goe beyond the course of nature, making things meerely contradictorie to subsist.
Let mee trouble your patience with one instance, which shall bee worthy your obseruation. When a Recusant shall sweare; for example, in taking the Oath of Allegeance, according to the expresse words of the Oath, and according to the plaine and common sense and vnderstanding of the same words, without any Aequiuocation, or mentall euasion
 or secret reseruation whatsoeuer. Could it be imagined that any shifting or cauelling wit should bee able to finde a starting hole in the same, to winde himselfe out of it? yet beholde an English Catholike (as hee nameth himselfe) but indeede the verie fierie match of this state and kingdome) in a letter written to a friend of his; hath (as hee would beare others in hand) found a meanes to auoid the force of this Oath, by Aequiuocating: as namely where it is said That the Pope hath no Authoritie to depose our King,Pet. 18.19. nor to dispose of his Kingdomes, and so forward what concerneth the Pope: true saith he, Without iust cause; or directly hee cannot; or in some such like sense. When as the deponent, sweareth directly against all, and euerie such mentall euasion and secret reseruation whatsoeuer; and that hartily, and wittingly, and truely; or else, let him refuse the Oath, and not sweare at all.
Heere is the verie quintessence of this cogging Artt: he recusant taketh the Oth according to the expresse words; not so saith our English Catholike, but hee must Aequiuocate: the Recusant followeth the plaine and ordinarie sense and meaning of the words; our English Catholike teacheth him to keepe somewhat in his minde, by secret reseruation: the Recusant abiureth and sweareth against all mentall euasion; our English Catholike instructeth him to make escape, by his mixt proposition; expressing a part of his minde by word of mouth, and reseruing an other part in his heart. Whether this bee to make shipwracke of Faith and a good conscience, malitiously and of set purpose; by open and manifest periurie, let any man iudge, which doth not wilfully shut his eyes against the noone-light? and being past feeling, is by Gods iustice giuen ouer to a reprobate sense.
Ye see the foulers of our times; their nets, their sleights, their wiles; wherein they goe beyond the Foxes in subtiltie in hunting after their prey. What remaineth, but that wee humbly desire our vigilant Magistrates, (to whome
 the charge of the Lords vineyard is committed) to take these Foxes both great and small: for what doe they else, but spoile and destroy our vines, which God hath placed amongst vs, in this fruitfull soile? And that wee our selues setting their snares before our eyes, carefully shunne and auoide them, which else will bring vs to perdition both of body and soule. And this of the subtiltie of the aduersaries of our Church.
2 The second circumstance and propertie, whereby the Prophet describeth them, is their crueltie; in renting and tearing Christ his flocke, and swallowing them vp quicke, as cruell beasts doe their prey.
It is not a new face of the Church; or proper to those daies and seasons, onely, which our Sauiour setteth foorth to our view.Stel. in Luc. Mat. 10.16. Behold I send you as sheepe in the middest of Wolues, For in that, our Sauiour speaketh in a time, neither past nor yet future to come, but in the present (I send you) he thereby giueth vs to vnderstand, that the dangers which are immine^t to his sheepe, conuersing amongst wolues, are alwaies present with them; there beeing no season wherin they are free from their rage and crueltie: whether wee call to mind the times past, or consider what now is or heereafter shall ensue. In hoc seculo, in his diebus malis, in this world of wickednesse (saith the Godly Father Saint Augustine) in these euill daies,De Ciuit. dei. li. 18. cap. 18 wherin sinne hath got the vpper hand; the Church, as a stranger and Pilgrime, holdeth on her course, sustained by Gods holy spirit; not onely, euer since Christ and his Apostles conuersed heere vpon the earth; but euen from the time of Abell the righteous, whose blood, his cruell brother Caine spilt vpon the earth. So ancient is the crueltie of these Wolues and rauenous beasts, preying vpon Christ his Flocke; and so continuing from time to time as their rage and rauenous appetite hath edged them forward.
By the furie of these Wolues, the holy Prophets were
 consumed, from Abel vnto Zacharias;Matth. 23.35. yea our Sauiour himselfe was made a pray vnto them; whose example serued to instruct his flocke, in all ages, what they were to expect, and trust vnto. For the disciple is not aboue his master, nor the seruant aboue his Lord, Matth. 10. vers. 24. And if they haue done these things to the greenetree, what shall be done vnto the drie? Luke 23. verse 31. The Apostles of our Sauiour, the rammes and bell-weathers of the flocke, haue all, in a manner, verified the words of their master: and what the condition of the Saints was in the Primitiue Church, the Author to the Hebrewes reporteth vnto vs: Some were racked, some tried with mockings, bonds, scourgings,C. 11. v. 35. etc imprisonment; some stoned, some hewen asunder some slaine with the sword. With which exquisite torments, and many moe of like sort, the crueltie of these Wolues could not be satisfied; but as Tacitus in his Annales recordeth,Li. 15. Pereuntibus addita ludibria, The Saints of God suffering martyrdome after this cruell manner, were further made laughing stockes to the world; in being clad with skinnes of wilde beasts, and so exposed to the tearing and renting asunder by dogges. And this not in some few, to the terror of the rest, but as the same Author addeth, when the day was not long enough to make them away in, they serued in vsum nocturni luminis, for men to see by in the night, by the flames, wherein their bodies were consumed. Eusebius goeth yet further, that the numbers in some places grew to be so great, that the executioners fainted with wearinesse, in their making hauocke, though one succeeded after another; and that the edges of their swords and axes, were dulled and made blunt with the multitude of the slaine bodies of the Saints; which he taketh not vp by way of credit, vpon other mens report; himselfe was an eie witnesse of it, in Thebais of Egypt.Eccles. histor. lib. 8. ca. 9. So cruell was the rage of these rauenous beasts, in these ten persecutions, vnder the Romane Emperors.
From which, if we suppose that the ages following were
 free,Iob 40.10. we erre and are greatly deceiued. Dilatat Behemoth caudam suam in fine mundi nequius. Behemoth (saith S. Gregorie) enlargeth his taile (wherein lieth his strength) more wickedly now in the end of the world;Moral. 3^. c. 12 The Diuels wrath waxing greater in these Wolues his instruments, by how much shorter he knoweth his time is to wreake his malice vpon the Saints. So that, as Berna^d distinguisheth, serm. 33. in Cantica, Pax est, and non est pax; there is peace, and there is no peace. Pax a Paganis. etc. The Church being in peace and rest from Pagans and Infidels, sed non profecto a filiis,Micah 7.6. but in sooth not secured of her owne children, nor of them of her owne house, yea most infested by them: For who are they, that for these many yeeres haue made hauocke and spoile of the Church, but such as would be tearmed,Gal. 2.9. I say, not only Pillars, as were Iames, and Cephas, and Iohn; but the very heads of the Church, Christ his Vicars vpon earth (as they stile themselues) the Popes of Rome, that very Antichrist, and scarlet coloured Whore, drunke with the blood of Saints, and with the blood of the Martyrs of Iesus,C. 17. v. 6. as the Spirit testifieth in the Reuelations. Witnesse, amongst many others, the Albigenses, against whom Innocent the third so proceeded by his censures, that in one Towne of theirs, 17. thousand of them were put to the sword, without any respect had, of age, sex, or degree: and in another Towne, one hundred and fourescore consumed together in one fire, because they would not abiure the faith of Christ,Histor. part. 3. tit. 19. c. 1. @. 3. and 4. Li. 4. pa. 1132. as Antoninus reporteth: witnesse the Protestants in Germanie, against whom, Paul the third excited Charles the Emperor, instigante Paulo, saith Genebrard their Chronologer; who, for the better managing of that warre, assisted the Emperor with an Army out of Italie, of ten thousand foot, and fiue hundred horse, vnder the conduct of his Nephew Octauius Farnesius, who was so confident in his forces, that departing out of Italy, he boasted before hand, that he would make such a slaughter in Germanie, that his horse should swimme in the blood
 of the Lutherans, as Iohn Sleidan is Author. Last of all,Commentar. li. 17. pa. 534. not to stand vpon examples, which in this kinde are infinite; witnesse the slaughters and butcheries Factionis Hugoniticae, of the Hugonites in France,Histor. li. 23. as Natalis wronglie tearmeth them; of whom, to the number of sixtie thousand, perished at Paris, and in other Cities of France, what time the Admirall was murdered: and in the ciuill warres, not so few as twelue hundred thousand, naturall French, are numbred to haue beene slaine: in which combustions, the Popes of Rome were the very Alastores and Apollyons,Brutum fulmen. p. 108. the fire-brands of these mischiefes.
With whose flames, if this our natiue Countrie haue not in like manner burnt within these late yeeres, it was Gods watchfull eie ouer our Princes and vs, which extinguished the sparkes whil'st they were enkindling; and not want of malitious crueltie in them, who were alwaies ready prest to minister fewell to these flames. The Buls of Pius 5. Gregorie the 13. Sixtus the 5. testifie as much, breathing out fire and sword against our late Souereigne (whose memorie shall be blessed in all posteritie) and by their loud lowing, calling in forraine powers against our Land, and exciting disloyall subiects; as were Tichborne, Parry, Squier, Walpoole, and such like, to treacherous conspiracies at home: some of which conspiracies, howsoeuer our English Catholike (hauing made his forehead as the Adamant) in his letter before mentioned,Pa. 34. and 89. tearme Ridiculous falfe deuises, and monstrous fictions, made against some Priests, to make their whole companie and cause odious: yet our Tribunals, and benches of Iustice and Iudgement, haue conuinced euidently this shamelesse vntruth; and the Secular Priests haue likewise published as much,Import. Con sid. p. 16. and p. 23, 33, 40. concerning these treacheries, to all mens view. So that now it necessarily ensueth, ex ore proprio, from the confession of our Aduersarie, that the companie of these Iesuites, and their whole cause, is iustly odious both to God and man, for their treacherous and bloody designements.

From which aspersions, in like manner, the two Breues of Clement the 8. will not be purged, although this Impostor wash them with niter (to vse the words of the Prophet) and take much sope to him.Ier. 2.22.
For most euident it is, that Catesby that Arch-Traitor, laid vpon them the foundations of the Powder-treason, in his conference with Garnet;Proceedings, R. 4. arguing from their authority rightly and strongly, that if it were lawfull not to receiue his Maiestie, that now is, or to repell him, as the said Breues did import; then it was also lawfull to expell or cast him out. Which was endeuoured with no lesse labour, then it was apprehended by hope to bee effected by powder, from the vault: by which most barbarous stratagemme, like rauenous beasts, they would haue swallowed vs vp quicke, and ouer-whelmed vs with a flood, but not of water: thunderclaps of powder, and streames of fire, should haue beene the swelling waters, which should haue gone ouer our soules.
^ueton. in vitaC. Caligula, that monster of mankinde, for his cruelty more then sauage, is famous for a wish, that in his bloodthirstinesse he conceiued against his subiects the people of Rome, which was, that they all had but one head, that so at one blow he might chop it off. But in this powder-treason, consider cruelty more brutish then was euer that of Caligula: For heere not the Prince (with whom, vnder God, is stored vp all power of life and death) is plotting against the subiect, but the subiects against the Prince: and that not in heart only wishing, but by their practises labouring, yea in a manner effecting, not the ruine of a famous Citie, but of a flourishing Kingdome; and not of the Kingdome, the Common-wealth alone; but of the Church also: in both Church and Common-wealth, aiming, not at the members without the head, but iointlie at both together, members and head also: not with the stroke of a sword directed by mans hand, in whom still resideth mercie, but by the mercilesse element of fire: and
 that not ordinarie, consuming by degrees, but the extraordinarie inuention of the diuell, ministring that kinde of fewell to mans rage, which swalloweth vp at one breath, and as it were at one mouth-full, whatsoeuer standeth in the way.
The holy oile, wherewith his sacred Maiestie was inthronized into this royall Kingdome, should haue beene no protection to defend him from the rage of this fire; though the Prophet, in Gods person, had before expresly charged, Touch not mine anointed; the Law prouided,Psal. 105.15. Deut. 22.6. that men should not take the damme with the yoong. Doth God take care of birds,Cor. as the Apostle reasoneth in the like argument? or was it written for our sakes? And yet in this share, the mother must haue perished with the sonne; root and branch together had beene consumed in this combustion. Gods iustice would haue spared Sodome, had there beene found in it but ten righteous:Gen. ^8.32. but rauenous furie had so possessed these beasts, that whom themselues deemed iust, must haue perished with the rest. The height of Maiestie adorned with so many peerelesse vertues, of learning, wisdome, godlinesse, temperance, iustice, clemency; the matchlesse Vine, with her tender plant, the future hope of our succeeding age; the noble Peeres, the most reuerend Bishops, the wise Counsellors, the graue Sages of the Land, the Knights and Burgises, and Officers of all sorts; all together, at one instant,Lutheranum inuentum ad ignem rapi^nt, vt sic anima eius in curru ignco, ^t loquitur Jesaita Hoffaeus, ad inseros feratur. Hassemmil histor. Iesuitic. ca. 6. pa. 224. P. 6. 7. 41. etc. Pa. 26. 42. and 125. must haue mounted vp into this firie Chariot (as Hoffaeus that bloody Iesuite was wont to say) that so their soules might haue beene harrowed into hell, if these Gunpowder-powder-inginers had been their Iudges.
In this treacherieso cruell and barbarous, as Impudency it selfe would be ashamed, I say not, to excuse, but, once to extenuate the hainousnesse of the attempt; see how our English Catholike plaieth the part of a diligent Aduocate, alleging the tribulation of Catholikes in our state and gouernment, meerely for conscience and Religion (of
 which he greeuously complaineth in sundry parts of his Letter) for the cause of this wofull attempt (to vse his owne words) in these vnfortunate gentlemen.
Wherein, to passe ouer the ingratitude of this vnworthy person towards his gratious Maiestie (of whose clemencie, not only the Recusants in generall, but many of the Popish Priests haue been, and still are partakers in great measure) I say only this, and that in a word, and I speake it in the sight and hearing of Almighty God, that if to bee a Rebell and a Traitor, be all one with a Catholike; and if due execution of iustice, be pressure and tribulation; then I willingly acknowledge, that some Catholikes in England haue perished vnder this pressure and tribulation. As for others, which suffer pecuniarie mulct in goods, or bodily restraint, or losse of Countrie by banishment; let him bee pleased to call to minde the fires and gibbets in Queene Maries daies, by which more innocents perished in some one or two yeeres, onely for profession of the Gospell, without the least imputation of treason, then Popish Traitors of all sorts, suffered in 45. yeeres of our late Souereigne, and in the six ensuing of his Maiestie that now is; when as our holy Martyrs would haue reckoned it for great fauour, to haue gone away with life and limme, whatsoeuer became of their goods and natiue Country.
Away then, euen for shame, with these foule blots and staines of crueltie and persecution: the milde and gentle aspect of our mercifull King admitteth them not; neither are they found in our State: they are the vnseparable markes and badges of the Romish Synagogue, as you haue heard; and of these holy Fathers, who rather succeed Romulus in murders and slaughters,The saying of Pope Adrian, Illine Catalog. testium verit. tom. 2. p. 483. then S. Peter in feeding Christ his flocke. And this be spoken of the cruelty of the Aduersaries of the Church.
3 I come now in the third place, to discusse the cause which produceth these effects of subtiltie and crueltie in the aduersaries of the Church: wherby they seeke and
 indeuour the subuersion and ruine thereof.
The Prophet layeth it downe in the third verse. They had swallowed vs vp quick when their wrath is kindled against vs. Wrath then was it that quickned the wits, and sharpned the rauening appetites of these enemies; making the^ so wily in theirsnares; so powerfull in their forces; and all to the perdition of the silly and weake Lambes of Christ his flocke? An affection by nature incident in a man, but as Bernard well noteth, Sermon. 13. vpon the 91. Psalme. abutentibus bono naturae, grauis perditio est, and miseranda pernicies: men abusing natures good, it becommeth a miserable ruine, and heauie perdition; not to men onely, but to things also without reason, yea without sense too.
Aspice nobilissimarum ciuitatum fundamenta vix notabilia,Lib. ^de ira. Cap. 2. Behold saith Seneca the foundations of most noble Cities, hardly to bee discerned, such is their desolation, has ira deiecit, it was wrath that cast them downe, and made them leuell with the ground. Consider countries and regions made desolate places, for many miles together; has ira exhausit, it was wrath, that in this manner drew them drie, and made them void without an inhabitant. It was wrath that put the instruments of crueltie into the hands of Simeon and Leui those Brethren in euill,Gen, 49, 5 whereby they put Hamar and Shechem with their people to the sword; and sacked their Citie after they had receiued circumcision, breaking thereby the bonds of promise, and the very seale of their faith. And therefore most true is that verdit which the wise King hath giuen of this vnbridled affection; Prouerb. 27.4. Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging. And Saint Chrysostome in his 29. Hom. to the people of Antioch, as if he had foreseene the powder-Treason, ira ignis vehemens omnia deuorans, anger is like a mightie fire co^suming all things. And Saint Augustine Ser. 1. De tempore, Iracundia bestia crudelissima, wrath saith hee, is a moste cruell Beast, renting and tearing with her teeth: consonant with
 our Prophet in this place. With whome accordeth Saint Basil in a Sermon of this argument, comparing it to the swelling Waters, of which our Psalmist speaketh. The violent forces of men inraged with furie, carrie (saith hee) all things before them* like floods and inundations. Such a fire, such a Beast, such a swelling water is wrath in a man, possessed therewith: it consumeth, it deuoureth, it ouer-whelmeth al things, and therefore no meruaile, when the fountaine is so bitter, if the streames issuing from thence, bee so vnpleasant as hath beene declared.
Yet because as Saint Ambrose obserueth vpo^ the fourth to the Ephesians; Ira motus est naturalis conceptus ex causis, anger is a naturall motion, or commotion rather, conceiued vpon some cause: Let vs consider the cause, that exasperated the aduersaries of the people of Israel in such sort, as the Prophet in this Psal. co^plaineth. A learned modern expositer,Wolf. Muscul. rendreth this reaso^ of it: that Israel hauing obtained a king of the Lord, that went in and out before them; they would no longer put their necks and shoulders, vnder the yoake of their enemies; who before that time had dominion ouer them: vpon this defection, they make out after them with their forces, pursuing them in hostile manner to reduce them to their wonted seruitude, as Pharaoh had dealt with them in former times.
A liuely Type of the aduersaries of Gods Church in all ages, wherein wee may plainly see, what hath caused them from time to time to pursue Christ his members, with such deadly wrath and hatred. It is, because vpon the admonition of the Angell,Reuel. 17.4. 2. Cor. 6.14 they are gone out of Babilon; or to speake with the Apostle, because they will not, iugumducere cum infidelibus, bee yoaked with Infidels and Heretikes in their errors and superstitions, hauing obtained a Dauid a King of God his Sonne Christ, that holy one, the Lords annointed.
For if there bee any thing in the world that dooth prouoke a man and kindle his affections, it is Religion which
 maketh him not only defend to the vttermost of his power, and with his best endeuours, what he conceiueth to be pure, but also to prosecute with all might and furie, the contrarie sect, to the vtter extinguishing and rooting vp of it, supposing that in so dooing, they fight Gods battailes. Hence proceeded that deadly fewd betweene the Hebrewes and the Egiptians;Gen 43.32 they might not eate together, for that was an abomination vnto them: between the Iewes and the Samaritans,Ioh. 4.9. they medled not one with the other. The Poet obserued as much among the Gentiles.
Immortale odium, and nunquam sanabile vulnus.Inuenal. Satyr. 15.
Hatred without end, and a breach which neuer could bee cured.

--Quum solos credat habendos
Esse deos, quos ipse colit.--

Because euerie nation beleeued those onely to bee Gods whome they worshipped. And Iulian noted it amongst the christians, as Amnianus Marcellinus reporteth: who found, he said, no beasts so deadly one to another, as Christians were to Christians: which beeing spoken by so great an enemie, as was that Apostate, would carrie little credit with it, were it not that the histories of the Church recorded as much of the Nouatians, the Arrians,L. 22. the Donatists and such like Heretikes against the Catholikes; whome impatience as S. Cyprian noteth, ad hostili a and furiosa odia compulit, prouoked and forced to furious out-rage and deadly hatred.
Heere was that Sword, of which our Sauiour fore-warned. Mat. 10.34. Thinke not that I come to send peace into the earth, I came not to send peace, but the sword: whose part, Christ his Vicar thinketh hee plaieth not well, if hee bee not euer now and then sending abroad his sword into protestant kingdomes, because both Prince and people, are in his censure no better then forlorne Heretikes, past all hope of recouerie and amendment.

To which greeuous imputation wee answer with Saint Paul, that after this way which his holinesse is pleased to call Heresie, wee so worship the God of our Fathers, beleeuing all things which are written in the Law and the Prophets;Act. 24.14. yea moreouer in the Euangelists and Apostles, to whose iudgement if hee will stand, wee will easily lay this crime vppon himselfe; in departing from the truth of that Gospell, which not only Moses and the Prophets, but our Sauiour and his Apostles preached.
I will not now anotomize, and rip vp the whole body of popish superstition; wherein nature is opposed to grace; Saints merits to Christs his blood; their mediation to his intercession; vnwritten vanities, to the written truth, works to faith, with many such like will-worships, which are after the doctrines of men: let the tryal be made in one point; the misundersta^ding wherof so much troubleth the Christian world: I meane the natural and ciuil obedience of dutiful subiects towards their lawful princes.
A duetie enioyned by our Sauiour. Mat. 22.22. Giue vnto Caesar the things that are Caesars: and seconded by that chosen vessell, the Apostle of the Gentles, Rom. 13.7. Giue to all men their duetie, tribute to whome you owe tribute, custome to whome custome, feare to whome feare, honour to whome you owe honour. Whence are those graue and Religious exhortations of the holy Apostle Saint Peter. 1.2.13. Submit your selues to all manner ordinance of men for the Lords sake, whether it bee to the King as vnto the Superior, etc and of S. Paul, Let euerie Soule be Subiect vnto the higher powers, Rom. 13.1. The reason of both, is worthy to bee ingrauen in the heart of the subiect with the point of a Diamond: for the Lords sake saith Saint Peter; for there is no power but of God, saith Saint Paul, with whome concurre the Law and the Prophets; the ancient Fathers of the Church, both in their writings, and in their meetings in generall counsell: which might as easily bee alleged if neede required.

But our Aduersarie acknowledgeth as much, as he doth vs to wit in his letter; namely,Pa. 16.50. that Subiects are bound to obey their Temporall Princes in all things lawfull; and those not only good Princes, but had also; and that not only of feare and flatterie, but of conscience, as the Apostle teacheth, Propter conscientiam, for conscience sake.
Why then ioine we not, as in tongue, so in hand and heart also, and admit the triall of our obedience by the touch-stone of true fidelitie, in taking the Oath of Allegeance?Pa. 14.15.16. and 50. Because (saith our English Catholike) besides the exaction of naturall obedience which is lawfull, the Oath containeth diuers other points also, concerning matters of Catholike Religion, which are vnlawfull. For whereas the Oath is diuided into 14. seuerall parts, 12. of them at the least (as hee auoucheth) touch the Popes supremacie one way or other. As where it is said in the Oath, that the Pope hath no authoritie to depose our King, 2. to dispose of his Kingdomes, 3. to authorize any forraine Prince to inuade or anoy him or his Countries, 4. or to discharge his subiects of their Allegeance, 5. to giue licence to any of them to beare armes against him, 6. or to offer violence to his person, or gouernment, or Subiects, The assertion of all which points, and other such like specified in the Oath, are (saith he) matters of Catholike Religion.
But who seeth not (whose eies God hath opened to behold the light of his Gospell) that this Religion falsly termed Catholike, vtterly peruerteth the lawfull subiection of people to their Souereignes; and that Hell is not more opposite to Heauen, then the bearing of armes by the subiect against his Prince, raising tumults in his dominions, offering violence to his person, state, or gouernment, is contrarie to his allegeance and fidelitie? Christ (saith S. Chrysostome in his Commentaries vpon the 13. to the Romanes) made nor Lawes, to ouerthrow the state of common-weales, but that he might the better order and establish them: but to depose Kings, to dispose of their dominions, to take the Crowne from one, and giue it to another,
 as men tosse a tenice ball in the Court, from Henrie to Rodulph, and so along; to assoile subiects of their fidelitie; these and such like, which are after the decrees of latter Popes, ouerthrow the very foundations of Kingdomes and Common-weales: which transcendent authoritie, whil'st they assume vnto themselues, by vertue of the Churches censure, they goe farre beyond the bounds and limits of their commission.
For excommunication, being a punishment meerely spirituall, depriueth a man onely of such spirituall comforts, as otherwise he should receiue at the hands of the Church: but no way impeacheth his estate in his goods and possessions;De Iure and iusti. li. 1. c. 6. Conclus. 2. as their owne Soto teacheth. And much lesse hath it any force to depose Princes from their thrones, to absolue subiects from their obedience, to warrant them to rebell, to say violent-hands vpon their Souereignes, or any way to conspire, or worke their death.
Wherefore, let this bee the obedience of such Popish Recusants as refuse to professe their fidelitie by taking the Oath;Bulla Pij 5. and Gregorij 13. outwardly to make a shew of it, ad redimendam vexationem, to keepe themselues from troubles and mulcts; yet with these circumstances: 1. Rebus sic stantibus, the State standing so firme, as (God haue the glorie and praise for it) it doth: such an vnion and consent in Prince, Peeres, and all good Subiects, as need not dread the face of all their enemies: and 2. Donec publica Bullae executio fieri possit, that is, vntill they haue got strength enough to make head against their Souereigne: and then downe with him, by open hostilitie, or secret conspiracie, it maketh no matter which, so they haue their watch-word from Rome by the Popes excommunication and deposing of him. But for vs, beloued, which haue otherwise learned Christ, let these seeds of disloyaltie and treason bee farre from our hearts: Let vs giue to our Caesar his feare, his honour, his seruice, his protection, by our bodies, goods, and liues; which are his, were he as wicked as was euer Nero: how
 much more, being so good and gratious, so zealous of Gods honour and of his subiects good: Neque enim pietatem subuertic ista subiectio; this subiection (saith S. Chrysostome) subuerteth not pietie; nay it confirmeth it more. Neither is this spirituall, but ciuill obedience, due to the Prince ordained by God; not depending vpon the Pope, who exalteth his owne selfe.
Were he placed in his due ranke, Siue Apostolus, saith S. Chrysostome, were he an Apostle, that is, as good as S. Peter himself, or were he an Euangelist, or were he a Prophet; he were but a Subiect: or if all this serue not, the next words immediately ensuing will order him; Siue quis quis fuerit, or be he what he will be or may be, saith S. Chrysostome, if he consist of a soule and body,Rom. 13.1. he must be subiect to the higher Poxers, that is, to the King, or to the Emperour, Gods viue images vpon earth; and acknowledge them for his Lords,Epist. 32. as Pope Gregorie the great did Mauritius the Emperor.
Or if these bee matters which concerne Religion, and such as touch the Popes Supremacie spirituall, why doth not our English Catholike bring foorth his proofes, especially hauing made promise so to doe, in the fore-front of his Pamphlet? But open it, and peruse it from the first page to the last, you shall finde nothing therein, but his owne assertion; the Popes supposition, or at the most,Pa. 13. 14. 15. 50. 62. 74. 85. his determination; the authoritie of Cardinall Bellarmine; and the chiefest learned men of their Church, as he tearmeth them: that is, Herod and Pilate, the high Priests and Elders, the Scribes and Phariseis, with the nation of the Iewes, conspiring against our Sauiour, and seeking false witnesses against him, but finding none. For no better with vs is the credit of the Pope and his Consistorie, his College of Cardinals, and the whole swarmes of his Priests and Friars, in matters concerning their owne authoritie, contrary to the expresse words of holy Scripture.
Yea,Pa. 14.19.85. but if the Pope haue not this authoritie to proceed
 against Princes, by dethroning and deposing of them, for their restraint and amendment, Gods prouidence should be defectuous (saith our English Catholike) for the preseruation of his Church. I answer; Nothing lesse. For if S. Peter and his successors were able to gouerne the Church in the middest of al the stormes of persecutions vnder the Pagan Emperors (who laboured by all cruell meanes to root out the very name of Christianitie) without the vse of any such authoritie; how much more easie must it bee for them who claime succession from S. Peter, to gouerne the ship of the Church, when by the commandement of our Sauiour, the windes are ceased, and the stormes are laied? Vnlesse wee shall say, that the Church had not her due gouernment, but was tossed vp and downe with euery waue and puffe of winde, for the space of 1000. yeeres and vpward after Christ, vntill such time as Hildebrand, surnamed Gregorie the seuenth, lifted vp his Priestly launce (as they say) against Caesars sword, and vsurped the authoritie of decrowning Princes. Which were absurd, once to enter into any mans conceit of common sense or learning. Yet more then this our English Catholike saith not.
But perchance Matthew Tort, Cardinall Bellarmines Chaplaine, prooueth the point more substantially. True, if the wresting of a place or two in holy Scripture make any thing to the purpose. He allegeth out of Iohn 21.15.16. our Sauiour his charge to S. Peter, Feed my Lambes, Feed my sheepe: And out of S. Matthew, c. 16. v. 19. the like saying to S. Peter, I will giue vnto thee the Keies of the Kingdome of Heauen: and whatsoeuer thou shalt binde vpon earth, shall be bound in heauen; and whatsoeuer thou shalt loose vpon earth, shall be loosed in heauen. From whence (saith he) omnes Catholici colligunt, all Catholikes doe gather, that it appertaineth to the authoritie of the high Bishop (hee meaneth the Pope of Rome) not onely to haue power to loose from sinnes, sed etiam a poenis, censuris, legibus, votis, atque iuramentis, but from punishments, Censures, Lawes,
 vowes and Othes, When it shall make for Gods glorie and the Saluation of soules.
But when, may this [when] euer bee; that God shall bee glorified, by ouerthrowing all lawes, both diuine and humane? or is any thing more impossible, then that truth should receiue honour from lying and periuries? Is not this to make a lie for God, which holy Iob so much detesteth c. 13. ve. 9. Or in the best sense to do euill, that good may come therby? which whosoeuer shal atte^pt, the Apostle pronounceth of them, that their damnation is iust. Ro. 3.8.
Againe, where the Chaplaine auoucheth his exposition of loosing to bee ment, not onely of remission of sinnes, (which wee willingly acknowledge with his Lord and master the Cardinal) but also of relaxation, from lawes,de Rom. pontifi lib. 1. C. 12. vows and oathes, from the authoritie of all Catholikes (omnes Catholici colligunt:) either the ancient Fathers of the Church,In Mathae. Origen,In Psal. 38. Ambrose,Aduersus. Iouiu. l. 1. Hierome,In I^ha. tract 118. and de Agon. Christi. Ca. 30. AngustineDe Trinit. l. 6 Hilary, andChrysost. de sacerdot. lib. 2 Theophilact in Mat. cap. 16 Cypria^ de vnit Ecclesiaeseu de simplicitat. praelatorem. Ansel. in Mat c. 16. ver. 19. Beda ibid. etc. such like are no Catholikes; or else hee fathereth that vpon them, which neuer came within compasse of their thoughts.
Who moreouer ioyntly teach and professe, that the authoritie of binding and loosing, and feeding Christ his Sheepe, was by our Sauiour giuen as well to the rest of the Disciples as vnto Peter; that they all receiued the Keyes as well as Peter; what was said to Peter was said to all, the promise to Peter was common to all: they are the expresse words of these Fathers. So that as yet neither our English Catholike, nor the Cardinals Chaplaine haue said any thing to prooue, that the authoritie of binding and loosing, and feeding Christ his Sheepe, belongeth more to Saint Peter and his Successors, then to the other Apostles and their Successors; or that the Deposing of princes is a point of Doctrine belonging to the Popes supremacie, more then to the Supremacie of other Patriarkes; and much lesse that it is a matter of Catholike, that is, Apostolike or Christian Religion, for Subiects in any case at his command
 to beare armes against their Soueraigne, or to attempt any thing against his state and person.
By this which hath beene deliuered, I hope it is manifest, not only how repugnant the voice of that Antichrist of Rome is to the voice of christ and his Apostles, in the dutifull obedience of Subiects towards their Soueraigne: but also how pernicious Popish Doctrine is to States and Kingdomes, deposing Princes from their Throanes, and arming their Subiects against them.
And therefore howsoeuer the English Catholike in his Letter auerreth,Psal. 31. that libertie of Conscience (hee meaneth in Popish Religion) ought to bee as free in this Kingdome, as breathing, and the vse of the aire is common to all: yet the wisdome of our Solomon dooth see, that as one Temple could not containe Gods Ark and Dagon;1. Sam. 5.3.4. 2. Cor. 6.14.15 as light hath no communion with darkenes; Christ no concord with Belial; so neither can the puritie of the Gospell haue any agreement with Popish Superstition.
Our Sauiour himselfe hath deliuered his iudgement in this case. Mat. 12.25. Euerie kingdome deuided against it self shall bee brought to naught; and euerie Cittie or house deuided against it self shall not stand. And what greater diuision then this can be thought in a state and kingdom, then where Pote^tate is opposed to Potentate? the Pope against the king: Subiect against Subiect: Seruant against Seruant: both walking diuers waies, after diuers Masters. Such diuisions of hearts and affections, cannot but prooue deadly in the end to the body, wherein they shall bee found, bee it ciuill or Ecclesiastical, Church or Common-wealth.
From hence proceed wrath, enuyings, seditions, contentions,Dion. Cass. murthers; as Mecaenas long since tolde Augustus the Emperor. You may take it from a latter writer; whose testimonie is beyond all exception, as beeing an enemie; and therefore likely to aduise vs no more for our good, then what the force of truth wresteth from him. It is Weston the Diuinitie professor in the English Colledge at Dowaie
 lib. 3. de triplici hominis Officio. ca. 14. If, saith he, the people conceiue an opinion of their King to bee an enemie to their Religion, or to contemne it; what is there that they will not attempt against his life, to the effusion of his blood, iubente religione, and impelle^te cos de super numine, vti omnino apud se animis firmabunt. Religion commanding them, and the God, whom they worship, forcing them therunto, as they are perswaded in their consciences.
Could hee more liuely haue described our Iesuited Romanists, Whose Religion is rebellion, and murthering of Princes, especially whe^ their Lord God the Pope,Glos. in cap. Cum inter. Extrauag. Ioa^. 22 dominus Deus noster Papa (yee know whose saying it is) shall encourage and exhort them thereunto? And againe, in the conclusion of the Chapter. Whosoeuer (saith hee) shall consider the infinite hatred, which from time to time, hath passed betweene Heretikes and Catholikes, shall easily perceiue that it cannot stand with ciuill Policie, that sectaries of such contrarie opinions in Religion, should bee fitly conioyned in the same ciuill societie; and that the safetie of the Prince cannot suffer such promiscuous conuenticles, and confused manners of worship in Religion.
Our English Catholike acknowledgeth as much in his Letter: adding further, that besides internall dangers,Pag. 124. which (saith he) are euer consequent vpon such inward diuisions of Religion; if forreine occasions should be offered vs againe (as in former times they haue beene, by forraine warres) wee should not know how to trust the one the other.
Heere is plaine dealing indeede, you heare him now speake plainely, laying aside his vsuall manner of cogging and Aequiuocating: and is there not, iudge ye, great cause, that libertie of their conscience and Religion, which threatneth such dangers both to Prince and Countrie, should be as common amongst vs in this Kingdome, as the vse of the aire and breathing is common to all? or rather is there not great neede that the Statutes concerning obstinate Recusants, were put more duely in execution, and not lie sheathed
 so much as they doe in the scabbard? and that all loyall subiects were sealed like the Seruants of God in their foreheads: making open profession by their Oath of their dutifull allegeance towards their Soueraigne,Reuel. 7.3. which in a cause so conformable to Gods will and command; so behooufull to church and common-wealth; so neerely touching Gods glorie, the peace, safetie and honour both of Prince and People: whosoeuer should refuse, I wish his legs so fettered, though not with giues of yron, and his armes so weakned, though not by drawing one drop of blood; that these Serpents might not bee able to sting, when they most desired; nor these Wolues to prey vpon vs when they most longed.
Thus yee haue the roote from whence spring these bitter fruits of subtiltie and crueltie in the Aduersaries of the church; their wrath kindled not vpon a light and friuolous occasion, but burning with the zeale of Religion, though a zeale not according to knowledge, and religion without due feare of God, and reuerence of man.
There remaine yet two points vnhandled: the one, of the deliuerance of the Church from her enemies: the other, of the duetie of praise, and thanks-giuing to be performed for this deliuerance: which (the time beeing so ready to preuent me, and my voice failing) I will fould vp in a word, by way of application to our selues: whome as God hath made examples of his mightie power, no nation vnder heauen more, in deliuering vs out of the hands of all our enemies, both from the Snares of secret treacheries, and from the open violence of their intended cruelties: so there is no people in the world more obliged to the duetie of praise and thankes-giuing to the Lord.
I will not now stand to repeate vnto you our former deliuerance; that mirabilis Annus the yere 88. so long before spoken of, for the wondrous effects which it was expected it should produce: it suffiseth, that it was wonderful to vs, when standing, as it were still, wee saw the saluation of the
 Lord, fighting his and our battailes, against these, his and our enemies; and chasing them, vntill he had made almost a finall end of them, whom the Pope had blessed, with the name of inuincible.
Neither will I call to your mindes the manifold dangers and treacheries, so oft plotted against our late gratious Souereigne, and in her life, against ours: with which our most noble King that now raigneth, hath beene as freshly assaulted, sithence his entrance into his Throane and Kingdome: of all which, we may say with the blessed Apostle, From them all the Lord hath deliuered vs.2. Tim. 3.11.
Consider but this day, the birth-day, as I may tearme it, of our Country; in which both Prince and people came as it were anew into the world, deliuered from the dreadfull Powder-vault, the very belly of hell and confusion,C. 2.10. as Ionah sometime did from the belly of the Whale.
How desperate and bloody was the attempt? How secretly was the snare laid to entrap vs vnawares? When euery man sung to his neighbor, nothing but Peace, Peace, how neere were we brought to the pits brinke? I say not as Ionah did, Yet 40. daies; but yet, not so much as one day,C. 3.4. and we should haue beene destroied: when being ready to sinke, God stretched forth his hand vnto vs, as sometimes he did to Peter, and tooke vs as a brand out of the fire.Matth. 14.31. Zechar. 3.2.
Surely heere was neither want of malice, will, or subtiltie in the Aduersarie, in spreading the net, that it preuailed not; nor force of wisdome or deepe insight in any that preuented it: the heart of our most wise and prudent King, how large soeuer it bee, as the waters which couer the sea, yet was it at this time extraordinarily inspired from aboue, when out of a cloud of darke speeches, by the finger of God, he noted and pointed at the treacherie.
And therefore more properly may we take vp this saiing then euer did Israel,Tremel. and Iun. who spake it but in a trope and figure: If the Lord had not beene on our side, may we of England say; if the Lord had not beene on our side, when men rose vp against
 vs; they had then swallowed vs vp quicke, when their wrath was kindled against vs. But praised be the Lord, who gaue vs not ouer for a prey vnto their teeth. Our soule is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the Fowlers; when our enemies fell into the pit of destruction, which they had digged for vs.
Wherefore, let the praises of God bee alwaies sounding in our mouths, both of Prince and people, old and yong, men and maidens, women and children: let vs all in our places and callings, age and sexes, praise the name of the Lord, which is only to be exalted; not wisdome, strength, or worthinesse in our selues. And let others put their trust in horses and Chariots, in the multitude of their hosts, in the strength of their ships, in the Popes cursings and blessings; but let vs alwaies thinke and say, with our Prophet in the conclusion of this Psalme, Our helpe is in the name of the Lord.
To which most glorious name be rendred all praise, honour and glory, might and Maiestie, this day, and for euer. Amen.
FINIS.



A SERMON PREACHED AT THE SPITTLE.


MATTH. C. 7. V. 15.16.
Beware of false Prophets, which come to you in sheepes cloathing, but inwardly they are rauening Wolues.
Ye shall know them by their fruits, etc.


AMong the manifold dangers, amidst which the Arke of Gods Church is tossed vp and downe by the slie impostures of her enemies, as by so many stormes and surges; the perils by false Prophets and seducing Teachers are such, as if with diligent heed and attention they be not auoided, as the Syrtes and Rockes of the Sea, we are in danger euery houre to make shipwracke, before we can so much as see the hauen, wherein our soules long so earnestly to be at rest.
The greater is the vigilancie of Gods watchfull eie ouer his sillie flocke; neuer slumbering nor sleeping;Psal. 121.4. but as a carefull father warning vs before hand of them, Beware of false Prophets; and as a painfull master diligently instructing vs how we may know and auoid them: Yee shall know them by their fruits, saith our Sauiour: masked otherwise so with sheepes-cloathing, as that by their outward shew and habit, they are able to deceiue, if it were possible, the very elect.
For this sheepes-cloathing is that external habit, which
 naturally and properly belonging to the sheepe, maketh vs take them to be so, which come so clad vnto vs. It is, saithDe praescript. Haeretic. Caluin. Jansen. Tertullian, nominis Christiani extrinsecus superficies the superficiall outside of a Christian; that is, holinesse, but feined; pietie and Religion, but in shew: it isAuthor operis imperfecti, in Matt. hom. 19. Lucas Burgensis, etc. vestimentum ouile, the sheepes skinne indeed, his wooll, his fleese, his outward apparance and resemblance: but it is not Opus ouile, the true sheepes deed, his naturall worke; the Religion is not pure, the holinesse not sincere and vpright: which yet notwithstanding dazleth our eies, and peruerteth our iudgement, if we be not very wary and circumspect.
Therefore our Sauiour willeth vs, not to stand at gaze, and to looke vpon them; but (...), saith he, heed them, marke them, eie them well; which is, as S. Iohn expoundeth his Masters meaning, Beleeue not euery spirit, but trie the spirits whether they are of God, 1.4.1. A point of skill, beyond the reach of Babes, who being inexpert in the word, vse milke (such as they were, whom the Author to the Hebrewes therefore reprooueth for it, c. 5. v. 12.13. and as the Lay people are in the Romish Church, whose faith lieth foulded vp in the faith of the Church,Fides implicita. without any further search and enquirie:) it is the part of stronger men; yet not of the Pastor and Doctor alone, asPromptuar. Cathol. Dominic 7. post Pentecost. Stapleton would haue it; but of the flocke too, which through long custome haue their wits exercised, to discerne both good and euill, Heb 5. v. 14.
Author operis imperfecti, in Mat. hom. 19.Magna virtus boni, malum cognoscere: Heere is a speciall vertue and propertie peculiar to goodnesse it selfe, to discerne that which is euill: and, firma tutela salutis, scire quem fugias; a sure defense preseruatiue of our welfare, to know him whom thou must eschew and auoid: which that wee may bee able to performe, our Sauiour addethLucas Burgens. Maldonat. Symbolum, a badge or cognizance, though not a Priore (for God onely isAct. c. 1. v. 24. (...), the searcher of the hearts and reines) yet a Posteriore, a signe better suting with our vnderstanding, from the effect; By their fruits ye shall know them. Per hoc
 quod foris agitur, quicquid intus lat et aperitur, that which lieth hid within the heart, is made manifest (saithM^ral. l. 15 c. 34. Gregorie) by that which a man dooth without: as in the Water a face answereth to the face (saith Solomon) Prouerb. 27. verse 19.
And what are these fruits? TheHom. 19. author of the imperfect worke vpon Saint Mathew his Gospell, resolueth the doubt verie fitly in two words. Fructus hominis (saith he) confessio fidei eius, and opera conuersationis ipsius: the fruits wherby a man is knowne, the true Prophet is discerned from the false, the sheepe from the Wolfe; are the confession of his Faith, and his life and conuersation. For if a man hide the Wolfe vnder the sheepes-cloathing, how canst thou know him, saith the same author,Ioh. 1.47. nisi aut per vocem, aut per actionem: but by his voice or by his deedes? Si confessio eius conueniat cum scripturis, if his confession be consona^t with the Scriptures, if his life answerable to his profession, verus Christianus est, this man indeede is an Israelite, in whome is no guile: if otherwise, falsus Propheta est, it is the Wolfe vnder the sheepes-cloathing, shunne him, and beware of him.
So the^ ye haue in the word^ read vnto you, first a Caueat like a Pharos, set at the entrie of my text,Diuision. to giue light vnto vs, beware. Secondly the Rockes and Syrtes* which wee are to shunne, false Prophets. Thirdly, a reason of the danger, their disguised masking of themselues, because they come to you in sheepes-cloathing, but inwardly are rauening Wolues. Lastly, the markes and tokens whereby yee may discrie and discerne them, yee shall know them by their fruits. Which being the verie foundation of all the rest, my labour and time shall bee spent, (by Gods gracious assistance and your wonted patience) in laying open of them: which being disclosed, the rest of it selfe will fall to the ground, it beeing an easie matter to beware of the Wolfe, when hee is stripped of his sheepes-cloathing.
Yet the case so standing, asHomil. de auaritia. tom. 5. Chrysostome doth truely report it: multa ouium vellera, innumeri vbique lupi sub his occultati;
 that there are many Sheepe-skins, and as many Wolues that lie hid vnder them: and that many false Prophets, vnder colour of the true, haue in all ages crept into Christ his flocke: wee must heerein also vse a moderation: and out of many sortes, make choice of some, by which you may iudge of the rest.
And because euerie one as he is iealous of his reputatition: laboureth to remooue this imputation from himselfe; theHuiusmodi sunt Coluinistae Maldonat. Stapleto. Rubenus de falsis propheti^. Papists falselie charging vs with it; and wee laying it, as the truth is, and where it is to be found, vpon them: wee will heerein follow the aduise ofIn Mar. c 7. vers. 15.16. Ferus one of their Friars: laying aside our owne asseuerations, wee will name an Arbitrator betweene vs, to decide this controuersie; Scriptura iudex sit, let the Scripture saith hee, be the iudge, quem illa falsum Prophetam nominat, is procul dubio talis sit; whome the Scripture shall say to bee the false Prophet, let him bee so reputed and accounted.
Now the instance to make tryall by (to limit my selfe within some bounds) I will put infoure points. The first, concerning traditions. The second in worshipping of Images. The third in Miracles; all matters of Doctrine as yee know, and controuerted betweene vs and our aduersaries the Papists, and belonging to the voice of the Prophet: the first principall fruite, by which hee is knowne: the fourth and last, concerning manners and life; which are his deedes and actions, the other principall fruite, of which our Sauiour hath pronounced, by their fruites yee shall know them. By these ye may make an estimate of the rest, and accordingly iudge of the true and false Prophets.
First then to beginne with that, which is the foundation of many others. Our Sauiour (saith Ferus) calleth them false Prophets, Mat. 15.3. which transgresse the commandements of God by their traditions.Lib. in c. 7. Mat. For these. Mat. cap. 23.16. hee calleth for the same cause, Blinde Guides, which are all one with false Prophets, and denounceth a vae against them, Woe be vnto you blinde guides.

Now this is an essentiall propertie of the Guides and doctors of the Romish Synagog; who not contenting themselues with the fountaines of liuing waters, the holy Scriptures and word of God, as not containing all things sufficient for manners in this life, and Saluation in that which is to come, dig to themselue pits, euen broken pits of diuers and sundrie traditions, which in truth can holde no water.
For thusBellarmine de verbo dei. l. 4. c. 2. they teach and professe, that besides the written word of God, there is an other part thereof not written (their meaning is in the Scriptures) and by the first Authors therof, the Apostles of our Sauiour, though otherwise it be exta^t, almost in the ancie^t Fathers, (Bellarmine. as they say) which they tearme and call traditions, of which they make many sorts; agreeing in this, that they concerne both faith and maners.
What reckoning and account they make of these traditions, shall come from their owne mouthes: for otherwise it would seeme, I suppose, incredible, what they ascribe vnto them.
ThePari pietatis affectu et reuerentia ses. 4. decret. 1 Councel of Trent decreeth, that they are to bee receiued with the like affection of Godlinesse and reuerence, wherby wee admit and reuerence the bookes of the old and new Testament.Eande^ vim habent. de verbo dei. li. 4. c. 2 Cardinall Bellarmine saith, that they haue all one Force and strength.Perinde infallibile^ auctoritatem habent. Analis. fidei Cathol. li. 8. cap. 6. sec. 2: Gregorie of Valentia; the authoritie of each is alike infallible, and cannot deceiue. Cardinall HossiusMulto maxima pars euangelij, peruenit ad nos traditione per ex igua literis est mandata. confess. Catholica. c. 92. not content with this paritie, addeth further, that far the greatest part of the Gospel came to vs by traditio^, when but verie little thereof was committed to writing. AndEx traditione noui testamenti scripta omnia authoritatem acceperunt. Annal. 46.1. Ann. 53. num. 11. Cardinal Baronius, as if this were not enough, auoucheth, that all the bookes of the new Testament, receiue their authoritie from traditions. In regard whereof hee preferreth them before the Scriptures; because Scriptures, saith he, vnlesse they be established by traditions, haue no beeing: when as traditions without the Scripture, are firme and stable in themselues. SoScripturae nisi traditione firmentur, non subsistunt, traditiones vero sine scriptis, suam obtinent firmitatem.
 likewise t Petrus a Soto before him,Fundamentu^ and explicatio defens. Cathol. confes. l. 2. c. 68 calleth them the foundation and exposition of the Scriptures: AndLydius lapidus Panopl. li. 1. cap. 9. Lindane, the touchstone of true and false doctrine. Finally, Andradius saith, That many points and heads of Faith, would reele and totter, were they not supported by the assistance and authority of traditions,Multa sidei nostrae capita reperies nutare iam et vacillare, si tollas traditionum subsidium et auctoritate^. Orthodox. Explicat. l. 2. p. 80. yea not onely reele and totter, but a great part of Religion would also perish (saithSine quibus magna pars religionis perit, et ad inane nomen Euangelium redit. de. sens. Cathol. l. 2 cap. 68. Soto) were it not for those partes of Doctrine, which are maintained by tradition; and the Gospell would come to a vaine name, without substance; which I easily grant and acknowledge, in their Popish Faith and Religion, which can no more stand without traditions, then a huge building without a foundation.
For it is the confession proceeding from their owne mouthes, that the Primacie of the Pope, and Sea-Apostolike is from tradition; their fiue Sacraments of Confirmation, Order and Matrimonie, Penance, extreame vnction, with their elements, words, fruites, and effects; the consecration of water and oile in the sacrament of Baptisme; The Doctrine of Transubstantiation, and receiuing in one kinde; of auricular co^fession, satisfaction, choise of meats, Fastes purgatorie, monastical profession, single life, praier for the dead,Petrus a Soto vt supra. Peresius de traditionibus parte. 3. Lindanus panop. li. 4. c. 100. Canus locor. Theologic. li. 3. ca. 3. 4. 5. with the rest. inuocation and worshipping of Saints, worshipping their Relikes and images; in a word, scantlie any matter in controuersie betweene vs, which they acknowledge not to bee grounded on tradition; howsoeuer with consciences more then seared, in their disputes they alleage Scriptures for proofe of them; andIn his Rock. Sanders proclaimeth that they haue moste plaine Scriptures, in all points, for the Catholike Faith (falsely so called) and none at all against the same.
The case then standing thus with the Popish Religion, it is no maruell if so highly they extoll their traditions, and on the other side thinke and speake so baselie of the holy Scriptures, tearming themTilmannus. H^shusius sexcent. errores. Tit. de Scriptura. Sac. a nose of Wax readie to receiue any impression, expound it how a man list, a leaden

Doctor Cole the Papist, being Visitor in Cambridge, when a Bible was brought vnto him to be defaced, called it Bible Bable.
These blasphemies against Gods sacred word, whichRom. 1.16. 1. Cor. 1.24. S. Paul calleth, the wisdome of God, and the power of God vnto saluation, to euery one that beleeueth; demonstrate these Popish Doctors (if I should adde nothing more) to be those false Prophets of which our Sauiour heere speaketh. For right so did their fore-fathers, the ancient Heretikes, vilifie the holy Scriptures, and magnifie their Traditions, asLib. 3. cap. 2. Irenaeus a mostancient Father testifieth. Cum ex Scripturis arguuntur, When (saith he) men argue against them, and they are reprooued out of the Scriptures, they turne themselues to accuse the Scriptures, quasi non recte habeant, as if they were not right, neque sint ex authoritate, nor haue authoritie in them, and quia sint varie dictae, and because they are diuersly spoken, and haue diuers senses, and quia non possit ex his inueniri veritas, ab his qui nesciant Traditionem, and because the truth cannot bee found nor gathered out of them by such as know not the Traditions: Non enim per literas traditam illam, sed per viuam vocem. For (say they) the truth was not deliuered by writing, in the holie Scriptures; but by word of mouth, from man to man. NeuerNon tam ouum ouo simile Cicer. Acade^. quaes. l. 2. was one egge so like another, as these old Heretikes and our Popish Doctors, Soto, Lindane, Pighius, and such like of the Popish crew.
So likewise are many of their reasons and arguments, the dull and blunted weapons of the old Heretikes, returned vpon them so often by the ancient Fathers.
De verbo Dei, l. 4. c. 5.Bellarmine allegeth, for proofe of his Traditions, that of our Sauiours, Iohn 16. v. 12. I haue yet many things to say vnto you, but yee cannot beare them now. With which saying
 of Christs, all Heretikes, euen the most absurd and foolish, which notwithstanding would be called Christians, did endeuour to colour (saithOmnes insipientiss haeretici, qui se Christianos vocari volunt, audacias figmentorum suorum, quas maxime exhorret sensus humanus, hac occasione Euangelicae sententiae colora^e conantur. Jn Euang. Johann tract. 97. S. Augustine) the audacious fictions of their idle braines, which the sense of man did most of all feare and abhorre. But as that godly Father answereth, so say I; If our Sau^our concealed those things, quis nostrum dicat, ista velilla sunt? who is he amongst vs, that may say, they are this, or they are that. YetHaec multa non erant diuersa ab his, quae hactenus Dominus praesens docuerat, sed planior and clarior eorum explicatio. Concordant. fol 964. Iansenius, one of their owne, well obserueth, that these many things were not diuers and contrarie to those which our Sauiour taught his Disciples whil'st hee was present amongst them; but only a more full and cleerer explication of them.
SoLoc. theol. l. 3. c. 3. fundamento 4. Canus allegeth that of the Apostles; We speake wisdome amongst them that are perfect, 1. Cor. 2.6. whereby he would prooue, that certaine holy mysteries were communicated by the Apostle, apart from the ignorant, to the perfect: perfectis and maioribus. Euen as the old Heretikes (saithHanc sapientia^ vnusquisque eorum esse dicit, quam a semetipso ad^nuenit, fictione^ videlicet. Irenaeus) by occasion of these words of S Paul, Did euery one of them call the fiction of their owne b^aine, this selfe same wisdome of which the Apostle spake? ButSi quaedam inter domesticos disserebant, non tamen ea fuisse credendum est, quae aliam regulam fidei superducerent, etc. De praescript. haeretic. Iansenius rightly noteth,Sed quod suae prae^^^otionis and fidei mysteria perfectius aperiret perfectioribus, sermonemque suum aptaret audientium capacitati. Concordant. f. 965. as did Tertullian before him, that the Apostle did not signifie by those words, that he taught the perfect one thing, the vnperfect and ignorant another thing; cum vtrisque eandem fidem praedicaret, when as he preached the same faith to them both:Sed quod suae prae^^^otionis and fidei mysteria perfectius aperiret perfectioribus, sermonemque suum aptaret audientium capacitati. Concordant. f. 965. but that his preaching was not all after one manner, which he applied to his hearers, to some more perfectly and profoundly, to others after a plainer fashion, according to the capacitie of each of them.
Againe, what the Apostle writeth to Timothie, O Timotheus, keepe that which is committed vnto thee, depositum custodi, 1.6.20. isCanus. Bellarmine. etc. generally alleged of them, for proofe of their Traditions. And so was it by the old Heretikes, as

De praescripion. hae^eticor. Tertullian witnesseth; who from thence taught, that the ApostlesApostolos non omnia omnibus tradidisse, ibid And non omnia omnibus reuelasse: quaedam palam and vniuersis, quaedam secreto and paucis demandasse: quia and hoc verbo vsus est Paulus ad Timotheum, O Timothee, depositum custodi ib. deliuered not all things to all sorts of men, but committed some things openly and to all men; other matters secretlie, and to few. But depositum, or the thing committed, signifieth the whole charge which the Apostle committed to Timothie,Quod praeceptum supra and infra ex scriptis intelligerat, non nescio quid ostendi hoc dicto de remotiore doctrina, etc. ib. and particularly the true forme of sound doctrine, deliuered vnto him in that Epistle by S. Paul, and not hid elsewhere, or farre fetched, as Tertullian expoundeth the Apostle.
But of all authorities of Scripture alleged by our aduersaries, that which S. Paul writeth to the Thessalonians, 2.2.15. is in shew most cleere for them, Stand fast, and keepe the traditions which yee haue beene taught, either by word, or by our Epistle. In which words the Apostle maketh mention of doctrine not only written, but also taught by expresse word of mouth. Which as we ingenuously acknowledge, it being a truth; so we say withall, that it maketh nothing for our aduersaries. For although at that time, when the Apostle wrote those Epistles to the Thessalonians (Baron. Annal. tom. 1. an. 53. num. 11. which are more ancient then diuers of the writings of the Euangelists, and the Epistles of the Apostles) some, yea many points of doctrine were deliuered in the Church by word of mouth; yet this is not against vs, which haue those writings of the Euangelists and the Apostles, which the Thessalonians had not then: In all which now written, we affirme to be comprehended all things which concerne faith and good manners, and whatsoeuer is needfull to be beleeued: so, as that it is either expresly written, or by necessarie consequence may soundly be deduced and concluded out of the Scriptures.
For concerning the old Law, Moses giueth this charge in the person of God: You shall put nothing thereto, neither take ought therefrom, Deut. 4 2. And of the Gospell, S. Paul saith, that though himselfe, or an Angell from heauen preach otherwise then that which he had preached to the Galatians, let him be accursed, 1.8.9. The like is S. Iohns testimonie of the things recorded in his Gospell: These things are written
 that yee might beleeue, that Iesus is the Christ, the sonne of God, and that in beleeuing, yee might haue life through his name, c. 20. v. 31. Vpon which words, Hugo the Cardinall hath this remarkable note: Specialiter intentio huius libri, generaliter vero totius Scripturae finis, his verbis declaratur: By these words, the scope of this Gospell in speciall is shewed; but in a generalitie, the end of the whole Scripture is declared. According heerein with S. Paul, 2. Tim. 3.16.17. The whole Scripture is giuen by inspiration of God, and is profitable to teach, to improoue, to correct, and to instruct in righteousnesse, that the man of God may be absolute, being made perfect vnto all good workes. So the Prophet Dauid witnesseth of the testimonie of the Lord, that it giueth wisdome to the simple. Psal. 19. v. 7. Euen that wisdome which is able to make vs wise vnto saluation, through the faith which is in Christ Iesus, 2. Tim. c. 3. v. 15. Therefore when one demanded of our Sauiour, what he might doe to inherit eternall life; hee referred him to the Scripture for his direction, Luc. 10.25.26. As Abraham sent the rich Gluttons brethren to schoole to Mos^s and the Prophets, that he might auoid the torment of hell fire, Luc. 16. v. 28.29.
If then the Scriptures are so perfect, that wee must adde nothing to them, nor take ought from them; if no other Gospell must bee preached, vnder paine of Gods curse; if by the writings of the Prophets, the Euangelists and Apostles, we beleeue that Iesus is the Christ, the sonne of God, and by faith in his name, obtaine eternall life; if they make the man of God absolute, and giue wisdome to the simple, that wisdome which maketh wise vnto saluation; if they direct vs to eternall life, and keepe vs from the torments of hell fire; it is as cleere as the Sunne-light at noone day, that they containe all things necessarie for saluation: and therefore the Papists, not contenting themselues with their sufficiencie, doe the very same, for which our Sauiour rebuked the Scribes and Phariseis, Mat. 15. v. 3. transgresse the Commandements of God by their Traditions.

Now if beside the voice of God speaking in his holy word, any heere present, require further the witnesse of man, and desire to know the minde and opinion of the ancient Fathers; although where God speaketh, it may well become man to be silent, yet that it may appeare, that we teach the same doctrine with the old Greeke and Latine Church, it shall not be amisse, the rather for the stopping of the mouthes of our aduersaries, who are alwaies bragging of the Fathers (of whom they are the degenerate children) to obserue their iudgement in this point.
First therefore,Quod per Dei voluntate^ in Scripturis nobis tradiderunt, fundame^tu^ and columna^ fidei nostrae futurum. lib. 3. cap. 1. Irenaeus saith, that the Gospell which the Apostles and Euangelists deliuered in the Scriptures, is the foundation and pillar of our faith.Ad puteos Scripturarum, ad aquas Spiritus sancti and haurire se^per, ac ple^um vas ref^rre domu^, etc. hom. 10. in Genes. Origen instructeth vs to haue daily recourse to the Wels of the holy Scripture, the waters of Gods holy Spirit; and to draw from thence, and to carry home our vessels full, like holy Rebecca.(...). Theodoret. li. 1. histor. Eccles. ca. 7. Constantine the great, in his speech to the Bishops assembled in the Councell of Nice, hath this worthy saying: The bookes of the Euangelists and Apostles, together with the Oracles of the old Prophets, doe plainly teach vs the things which we are to know concerning God. Athanasius in his Oration against Idols, thePiae Religionis and veritatis de vniuerso ratio cognitioque, per Christi doctrinam, sole clarius sese demonstrat. very first words thereof, The reason and knowledge of godly Religion and truth, doth demonstrate it selfe, more cleerely then the Sunne, by the doctrine of Christ. And immediately after,Sufficiunt quidem per se, tum sacrae and diuinitus inspiratae Scripturae, ad veritatis indicationem. The holy and inspired Scriptures from aboue, suffice by themselues, for the finding out of the truth.(...). pag. 394. Basil saith, that it is a manifest falling from the faith, and crime of arrogancie, either to reiect any thing which is written, or to adde any thing which is not written.Omnia clara sunt and plana ex Scripturu diuinu: quaecunque necessaria sunt, manifesta sunt, homil. 3. in 2. Thessal. Chrysostome yet more directly to the point: All things are cleere and plaine out of the holy Scriptures;
 whatsoeuer things are necessarie, are manifest.Non omnia quae D^minus fecit, co^scripta sunt: sed quae scribentes, tam ad mores quam ad dogmata putarunt sufficere: vt recta fide, and oper^bus, and virtule ru^^lantes, ad regnum, etc. l. 12. in Iob. c. 68 So likewise S. Cyril: All things are not written, which our Lord did; but tho^e things which the Euangelists the Writers did thinke to suffice, both for manners of life, and precepts of faith: that shining with a right faith, and good workes, and vertue, wee might come to the kingdome of heauen.(...). De Orthodoxa fide, li. 1. ca. 1. Damascene confesseth, that he receiueth, and acknowledgeth, and reuerenceth, all things which are deliuered in the Law and the Prophets, the Apostles and the Euangelists, seeking after nothing beyond these.
Yee haue heard by these, what the opinion is of the Greeke Fathers, concerning the sufficiencie of the Scriptures, without the supplie of traditions: With whom in like sort concurre the Fathers of the Latine Church.Scripturae plenitudinem adoro. aduers. Hermoginem. I adore (saith Tertullian) the fulnesse of the Scriptures. And immediately after:Scriptum esse doceat Hermogenis officina, aut t^meat Vae illud, adijcientibus aut detrahentibus destinatum. ib. Let Hermogines his shop teach, that it is written; or let him feare that Woe appointed for them which adde or detract any thing from the Scriptures.Vnde est ista traditio? vtrumne de dominica and Euangelica authoritate descendens; an de Apostolorum mandatis atque Epistolis veniens? Ea enim facienda esse, quae scripta sunt, Deus testatur, etc. ad Pompeium contra Epistolam Stephani. Cyprian distinguishing of Traditions, maketh this demand: Whence is it? (saith he) Doth it descend from the authoritie of our Lord, or his Euangelists; or commeth it from the commandement of the Apostles and their Epistles? For God witnesseth, that those things are to be done, which are written. And immediately after, he inferreth this conclusion:Si ergo aut in Euangelio praecipitur, aut in Apostolorum epistolis aut actibus continetur, etc. obseruetur etiam and haec sancta traditio. ib. If therefore it be commanded in the Gospell, or comprehended in the Epistles or Acts of the Apostles, etc. let this holy tradition bee kept and obserued also. But on the other side, it hath no ground in the word of God. Then marke whatAlia quae absque authoritate, and testimonijs Scripturarum, quasi traditione Apostolica sponte reperiunt, atque contingunt haeretici; percutis gladius Des. Jn ca. 1. Aggei. S. Hierome saith: Other things, which Heretikes doe finde of their owne accord, without the authoritie and witnesse of the Scriptures, as though they were deliuered
 by Apostolical tradition, the sword of God (which is his holy word. Ephes. 6.17.) cutteth off. But of all the ancient Fathers, the iudgement of Saint Augustine is worthy your obseruation, as being most sound, and directly to the purpose, who writing againstSiue de Christo siue de eius ecclesia, siue de quacunque alia re, quae pertinet ad fidem vita^que nostram non dicam nos nequa qua^ com parandi ei, qui dixit, licet si nos, sed omnino quod se^utus adiecit, si angelus de caela vobis annuncia uerit preterqua^ quod in scripturus legalibus et euangelic is accepistis, anathema sit, co^tra literas Petiliani li. 3. c. 6. Petilian the D^natist, denounceth this sentence, as it were with the spirit of the Apostle. Whether of Christ, or of his church, or of any other thing which appertaineth to faith, and to our life and conuersation, I say not wee, who are by no meanes to bee co^pared with him, who said, but though that we etc. Gal. c 1. v. 8. but that which the Apostle added, if an Angell fro^ heauen preach vnto you otherwise besides that which yee haue receiued in the Scriptures of the law and the Gospel, let him be accursed. And in his Booke de Doctrina Christiana li. 2. c. 9. InIn jis quae aperte in scripturis posita sunt inueniuntur illa omnia, quae contine^t fide^ moresque vine^di spem scilicet atque charitatem. Act. 26.28. those things which are set down plainely in the scriptures, all those things are to bee found, which concerne Faith, and the manners of a mans life, namely hope and charitie.
These testimonies of the ancient Fathers, are plaine and euident, and taken out of such their writings, as are on all parts confessed to bee their owne, and not counterfeited, such as our aduersaries vsually presse vs with in their daily disputes; and they are so forcible euen with them, that with Agrippa they become almost Christians: and subscribe to as much in effect, as we teach of the sufficiencie of the holy Scriptures.
Quae fidei veritates absolute et simpliciter ab omnibus hominibus necessario cognosce^dae et credendae sunt, vt et fide, et spe, et charitate ad beatitu dinem con^e^dere valeant. eas non diffitemur, pers^icue fere, in scripturis ipsis doceri vt Augustinus etiam nolauit Analy. fidei cathol. l 5 c. 2.Gregorie of Valentia, a Iesuite of great note amongst the^, acknowledgeth, that what verities of faith are absolutly and simplie necessarie to bee knowne and beleeued of all men, that they may bee able to come to euerlasting blisse by faith, hope, and charitie, those (saith he) wee denie not to be taught in the Scriptures themselues, perspicue fere, almost and in a manner plainly, as Saint Augustine hath also noted. But this fere almost, which the Iesuite inserteth, is like to that wicked glosse, which corrupteth S. Augustine his text. Of the two, Cardinall Bellarmine dealeth
 more ingenuouslie, acknowledgingDico illa omnia scripta esse quae sunt omnibus necessaria de verb. dei. l. 4 ca 11. that all those things (without any fere almoste) are written of the Apostles, which are necessarie and needefull for all mens knowledge. AndNon inficiamur precipua illa fidei capita, quae omnibus chr^stianis cognitu ^ut ad salutem necessaria, perspic^e satis esse Apostolicis scriptis comprehensa. c. de scriptura. 5. Coster the Iesuite in his Enchiridion: we deny not (saith he) that those chief heads of faith which are needefull to bee knowne of all Christians for their saluation, are contained plainely enough in the writings of the Apostles. To whome I might adde a cloud of witnesses of their own writers, both moderne and more ancient, iustifying against themselues, what wee teach of the sufficiencie of the holy Scriptures: but I must omit them for breuities sake.
What then meane those reproachfull speeches of the Papists, concerning the insufficiencie, obscuritie, vncertaintie, and inualiditie of the Scriptures, as I haue obserued? Wherefore is it, that they seale them vp in an vnknowne tongue, that the vnlearned may not vnderstand them?Jndex libror. prohibitorum regul. 4. WhyNauar Enchi rid. c. 11. nu^. 26 prohibit they the common people from reading them? why is it accounted a mortall sin amongst them for a lay person to dispute of matters of Faith?De expresso dei verbo. why doth Hossius auouch, that it is fitter for women to meddle with their distaffe then with Gods word? why dothDe verbo dei l. 2. ^5. Bellarmine so greeuouslie complain, that the translated bibles are in the hands of all artificers, not onely men but Women? but that by these woluish voices of theirs, you shold know them to bee the generation of those false Prophets and ancient Heretikes, whomeDe resurrec. carnis.

The voice of the shepheard and Bishop of our soules, is
 after another note, willing vs to search the Scriptures,1. Pet. 2.25. Iohn 5.39. And so saith the Prophet Esay, to the Law, and to the testimonie, 8.20. And S.

As you are Christ his sheepe, so heare ye the voice of Christ, speaking vnto you in the holy Scriptures; thereforeAugust. de doctrina Christiana. li. 2. c. 5. vt scriptura pervarias Jnterprcium linguas lon^e lateque diffusa innotesoeret Gentibus ad salutem, etc. translated into diuers tongues and languages, that they might be read and made knowen to men, for their saluation. Suffer not your selues to be robbed of these waters of comfort; neither digge vnto your selues the broken pits of vnwritten verities, which can hold no waters: and take this ofHom. 9. in Col. S. Chrysostome as a most grounded truth, that the cause of all euill and mischiefe is, quia Scripturae ignorantur; because men are ignorant in the Scriptures.
Thus much of the first instance, of the sufficiencie of the Scriptures, without traditions; whereby the Popish Doctors are conuinced to be the false Prophets, of which our Sauiour forewarned vs, in these words: Beware of false Prophets.

The second instance which I proposed, as the touchstone to trie the false Prophets by, is the worshipping of other gods in stead of the true and liuing God, which is God almighty, blessed for euermore.
For so Moses (saith Ferus) describeth to vs the false Prophet, Deuteronom. c. 13. v. 1.2.3. etc. If there arise amongst you a Prophet, or a dreamer of dreames (and giue thee a signe or a wonder, and the signe or wonder, which he hath told thee, come to passe) saying, Let vs goe after other gods, which thou hast not knowen, and let vs serue them; thou shalt not hearken to the words of the Prophet, or vnto the dreamer of dreames, etc. From which testimonie of Moses, Ferus gathereth this true proposition, thatIn cap. 7. Mat^h. whosoeuer with-draweth vs from God the Creator, to the creature, falsus Propheta est, he doubtlesse is a false Prophet, and one of these Wolues cloathed vnder the sheepes weed.
Now by this note, the Popish Doctors are so manifestly descried, as nothing can be more plaine and euident.
For these haue made vnto themselues, their god-saints, and their god-saints reliques, their breaden-god, their Crucifix-god, their Image-gods, of gold, siluer, brasse, wood, stone, and I know not what all. They haue made the Saints not only their Mediators and Intercessors vnto God, but also ioine them with God, as their protectors and defenders. So (saithIn his Epistle to the king, prefixed before the miracles of our Lady of Mont-aigne. Chambers) our English in their battles call vpon S. George, the Scottish nation and the Burgundians, vpon S. Andrew, the French vpon S. Denice, the Spaniards vpon S. Iames.Chambers, ibid. They flie vnto them in their maladies and diseases, for their particular helpes; as to S. Sebastian and S. Roch, to be preserued from the plague; to S. Hubert for the biting of madde dogs, to S. Blasius for the paine and swelling of the throat, etc.Dicat vtru^ Deus aliquando infir^ior fuerit, quam v^ potuerit prae^sse eis, etc verum non dignatus est, inquit, hoc facere: at hoc esset crimen superbiae. Cyril. contra Julian. li. 4. As though God were not all-sufficient and able of himselfe, or at least wise not willing to defend and succour vs. They build and dedicate Temples and Altars in their honour, appoint their festiuall daies, and set formes of seruice; they burne incense before their Reliques and Images,
 light Tapers before them, goe on pilgrimage vnto them; they garni^h them with all manner offerings, of gold, siluer, iewels, and whatsoeuer else may serue to make them seeme glorious in the eies of foolish and superstitious men; they reuerence them with cap and knee, fall downe prostrate before them, make their praiers vnto them before their Images, yea to the Images themselues. Thus, although their foreheads are not yet growen so whorish and impudent, as to call them in plaine termes, gods; yet in giuing to them thatSacra, sacerdotia, templu^, altaria, sacrificia, ceremoniae, dies festi, and quicquid aliud ad eam seruitutem pertinet, quae Deo debetur, and Graece proprie latria dicitur. Aug. de ciuit. Dei. li. 7. ca. 32. diuine and religious seruice and worship, which is proper to God only, they make them Gods, setting them vp in their Churches to bee adored and worshipped.
Time will not permit, neither is it my intent, to prosecute all these seuerall sorts of Idolatrie, but to insist onely vpon that which of al others is the most blockish and foolish; namely, the worshipping of Images: of which, when I shall make it apparant that the Papists stand conuicted, ye may the more easily iudge of the rest of their idolatry.
First therefore, this is euinced by the second Commandement, Exod. 20. v. 4.5. Thou shalt make thee no grauen image, neither any similitude of things that are in heauen aboue, neither that are in the earth beneath, nor that are in the water vnder the earth. Thou shalt not bow downe to them, neither serue them. In which Commandement, by the first clause, the making of an Image to represent God by, is forbidden; by the second, all manner kinde of religious worship, whereby superstitious men goe about to adore God, at, in, or before an image, any manner of way whatsoeuer. ThusLib. 7. Origen writing against Celsus, giueth the true sense of the Commandement, saying that Religion keepeth Iewes and Christians from worshipping of God, in Temples, Altars, Images; because the Law saith, There shall be no other gods vnto thee before my face; and, Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any grauen image, etc. Thou shalt not bow downe to them, nor worship them.
To this CommandementProhi^eri imaginem Dei factam ad exprimendam perfectam similitudinem formae and naturae ipsius. Si quis hac ratione Deum pingere tentaret, is verum idolum constitu eret. De ima. Sanctor. l. 2 c. 8 Bellarmine saith, It might bee
 answered in a word, that it forbiddeth the making of Gods Image, thereby to expresse his nature; which whosoeuer should attempt; should erect a true idol, and so be guilty of the breach of this Commandement.
But this the Gentiles knew, especially the wiser sort amongst them, Hermes, Zenophon, Euripides, Plato, as the ancient Fathers of the Church,In protreptiad Gentes. Clemens Alexandrinus,Li. 8. Arnobius andLi. 1. contra Iulian. Cyril record; namely, that God in his nature was incomprehensible, and that it was impossible, incorporeum corpore significare, to signifie and represent him in a body, who himselfe had none. And therefore they made not their Images, by them to expresse their diuine nature; but only some effects of it; to which they suted their images, worshipping God and his vertues respectiuely in them, and not the images themselues; asIn 3. Aquin. quaes. 25. ar. 3. Caietane, andIn c. 17. Actor. Ferus, with others of their owne, obserue. So that if by this answer, the Papists can salue themselues from breach of the Commandement, the Gentiles in like manner may doe as much; who yet by the iudgement of S. Paul, are condemned of Idolatrie, because they turned the glory of the incorruptible God, to the similitude of the image of a corruptible man, and of birds, and of foure-footed beasts, and of creeping things. Rom. 1. verse 23.
This the Cardinall happily vnderstanding very well, leaueth his first answer, and flieth to a second; vnderstanding the Commandement to forbid the making and worshipping ofDe quibuscunque simulacris, quae habentur pro dijs. Bell. de imag. Sanct. li. 2. c 8. such Images, which are reputed and taken for gods.
But this was already forbidden in the first Commandement; so that this answer of theirs confoundeth the Commandements, makingOporte^ dicere, illud non esse preceptum distinctum a primo, vt reuera dicunt Catechismi omnes Latini. Bell. de imag. Sanct. li. 2. c. 7. one of two, as the Papists doe in their Primars and Catechismes, that so men may not take notice of their idolatrie, when the Commandement is after this manner as it were razed out.
But the Commandements are distinct: the first condemning all false gods, Thou shalt haue no other Gods before
 me Exod. 20.3. The second all false worship, either in making of Idols, by them to represent God, or in worshipping them with any maner of Religious seruice. Thou shalt make theen grauen Image, etc. thou shalt not bow down to them, nor Worship th^m. Exod. 20. v. 4.5. For as God and his Worship are two distinct thinges, so the commandement concerning them, are two different precepts.
Thus the Iewes (who were most accurate in calculating the lawe, and euerie member and part thereof, vnderstood them to bee distinct, as appeareth out ofAntiquita. l. 3. c. 4. Iosephus andDecalogo. Philo: as also doeIn Synopsi. Athanasius andJn Exod. ho^. 8. haec omnia simul nonnulli putant vnum esse mandatum quod si ita putetur, non complebitur decem nume rus mandatorum, et vbi iam erit decalogi verita^? ib. Exod. 32.4. Origen; Origen acknowledging, that some tooke them but for one, but (saith he) if we doe so, the number of the ten commandements will not bee complete, and what then shall become of the truth of the decalog?
Furthermore it is worthy the enquiry, who these were, so sottish, that tooke images made by the worke of mans hands, for Gods, as Bellarmine saith? Surely they were not the Iewes, who worshipping the Golden Calfe, did not somuch as once imagin, that it was God, but by it, did represent, and in it worship the true God Iehouah, which brought them out of the Land of Aegipt. Nor the Gentiles: for they asOrat. 12. Dion, Chrysostome, andSermon. 38 Tirius Maximus declare, professed, that in their Images made of Golde, siluer, brasse, Iuorie, etc. They did worship summum, primum, maximum deum, the cheefest, first, and greatest God; the Creator and preseruer of all things. As for the Christians, Origen acquiteth them, as you haue alreadie heard. The Papists onely remaine; who heerein, especially the ignorant sort, are more blockish then the Gentiles; reputing the verie images of wood and stone (whome they adore) for God and his Saints
ThusDe Jnuentor rerum. l. 6. ca. 13. Polydore Virgill one of their owne, and therefore more like to couer their nakednes, then to lay open their shame, more then truth, vrged, reporteth of them, that they wereEo insanie deuentum est. etc. Ib. come to that height of madnes, that they worshipped
 Images made of wood, stone, brasse, or painted vppon the walles, and set foorth in diuers culloms;Non vi figuras, sed perinde quasi ipsae sensum alique^ habeant, et iis magis fident quam Christo. ib. non vt figuras, not as figures or shapes, but as if they had some sense in them; yea (saith he) they put more trust and confidence in them, then in Christ himselfe.
Hee taxeth other their follies in their offerings and pilgrimages vnto them: but beeing too lauish of his tongue, the PopishIndex expurgator. Belgic. in Polydor. censors haue taught him to bee more silent heereafter, and not to publish so vnnaturallie the spirituall fornications of his Mother the holy Church, razing and expunging out of him what I haue obserued, and much more.
Thus notwithstanding, whatsoeuer hath beene hitherto answered to the contrarie, the worship of Images, vsed in the Church of Rome, is Idolatrie, and condemned by the second commandement,2. King. 18.4 5 and therefore by no meanes, nor in any consideration whatsoeuer, lawfull.
Heereunto may bee added the example of that godly King Hezekiah, who when the people of Iudah worshipped the Brazen Serpent,Numb. 21.8. and burnt incense vnto it, brake it in peeces, though before time it had beene erected at the commandement of God himselfe: leauing therby an example to Christian magistrates, what is to bee done with Images, erected onely by the will-worship and curiositie of superstitious men, when religious seruice is done vnto them.
Reuel 19.10.For if the Angell, when Saint Iohn fel downe to worship before his feete, corrected him, and forbad him, saying, See thou doe it not; adding not onely a reason thereof, for I am thy fellow Seruant; but also instructing him in the true seruice,Act. 10. ve. 25.26. worship thou God. And if Saint Peter when Cornelius fell down at his feete, and worshipped him, tooke him vp, saying: stand vp, for euen my selfe am a man: what may wee imagin they would haue saide, if they had found any so blockishlie and superstitiously addicted, as to haue worshipped their Images, which the Papists will not, (I suppose)
 make fellow Seruants with Gods Saints,Esa. 44.10, 19 as not beeing so good as mortal men; but such as the holy Prophets describe them, abhominations and profitable for nothing:Ier. 10.8. Habac. 2.18. The doctrine of vanitie, and teachers of lies: then which, the Frog and Mouse, the Moule and the Batre, and euerie creeping thing is better, because asJn protreptic. Clemens Alexa^drinus saith, these haue life and sense; but images haue none; as the Psalmist describeth them, they haue eyes and see not,115. v. 5.6. eares and heare not.
Last of all, will the Papists haue vs worship Images? let them produce some example out of holy Scripture for this practise; and wee will follow it: let them alleage some precept of God, some exhortation of the holy Apostles or Prophets, for our warrant, and we obey: which if they cannot doe (as hitherto they haue not, neither can doe, themselues with one voice confessing that this point of Doctrine is grounded vppon tradition wherein what force there is hath beene declared:) then wee saie with Saint Augustine in his Treatise De bono viduitatis, c. 1 or who soeuer he were that compiled that worke, Sancta scriptura doctrinae nostrae regulum figit, ne audeamus sapere plus quam oportet,Rom. 12.3. the holy Scripture pitcheth the rule of our Doctrine in such sort, that wee presume not to vnderstand aboue that which is meete to vnderstand, as the Apostle teacheth, not daring in matters of Religion and Gods seruice, to turne aside from the holy Scripture so much as one step, either to the right hand or to the left.
How much lesse then to the worshipping of Images, forbid by God himself, and condemned by all the ancient Fathers or the Church, when she was moste pure and in her prime?l. ^ cont. Celsum. impossibile est vt quideu^ norit, supplex fiat statuis. Origen saith that it cannot be, that a man should know God, and worship Images. AndNon est dubium quin religio nulla sit, vbicunque simulachrum est. l. 2 cap. 18. Lactantius putteth it out of al doubt, that there is no Religion where an Image is erected to bee worshipped. ThereforeNobis nullu^ est simulachru^ in mundo quoniam in rebus genitis, nihil potest dei referre imagine^ lib 6. Stro^ma 1. Clemens Alexandrinus teacheth, that men are to learne from the Apostle, that they haue no Image in the world, because amongst the Creatures
 there is nothing that can resemble the image of God. S.Regem adorauit non lig^u vtque quia hic g^^^ ^ est er ^ur, et ^an^t (...) impio^um, sed ^d^raun illum qu^ pepe^dum in igno. De ^bi^u T^eodosii. Ambro e yet more directly to the purpose, speaking of Helen, who by the title found out the Crosse wheron our Sauiour was crucified: she worshipped (saith he) the King not the wood at all, b^cause this is the error of the Gentiles, and the vanitie of wicked men; but shee worshipped him, who hung on the Tree, that is Christ the Lord: WhereofCultores d^i imaginem ado rare no^ dehe^t, In ^a. 3. Daniel. Hierom giueth the reason, because such as are worshippers of God, ought not to Worshippe an Image. So likewise SaintNoui multos esse sepulchrorum et pictucarum adorato res, quos Ecclesia condemnauit, et quos quotidie ta^qua^ malos filios cor rigere studet, de moribus ecclesiae cathol. c. 34. Augustine, I knowe (saith he) that there are many Worshippers of Sepulchers and pictures, etc. whose maners the Church condemneth, and which she indeuoureth to correct and amend daily, as being euill Sonnes; which was the labour and diligence of Church of Rome, in the time ofQuia eas adorari ve^uisses o^^ino laudaui mus. Ep. l 9. Ep. 9 et l. 7. ep. 109. Gregory the great, as appeareth by his Epistle to Serenus, in which hee teacheth expreslie, that Images are not to bee worshipped. And this was the current Doctrine of the Church, for the space of 600. yeares after Christ.
The greater is the vntruth which CardinallImagines suum honorem in ecclesia semper habuerunt, de imag. li. 2 c. 12 Bellarmine setteth abroach, affirming that Im^ges haue alwaies had due honor in the Church. For vntill the secondwhich was in the yeare 788. Center. Magdebur. Cent. 8. c. 9. pa. 589. Nicene councel a^sembled by the superstitious Empresse Eirene, the honouring and worshipping of images was neuer publikelie established: and then beeing authorized, it was eft-soones disanulled by a councell held atAnno. 794. cent.

Fra^k-ford, vnder Charles the Great, which defined out of Gods word, that the Worshipping of images was vnlawful; pronou^cing against that of Neece, that it was Pseudo synodus a false Synod or Councell, and therefore no credit to bee giuen to it. Since which time, many haue risen amongst themselues, in the verie height of Poperie, which haue gainesaid it.

Tridentin par. 4. pag. 46. loquendum vt vulgus, we must speake and say as the manie doe.

Esa. 5.20.) because Saint Iude calleth sinners wicked. v. 15. which he needed not to haue done so distinctly; if some sinners were not godly. And Shechem, or any wa^to^ fornicator, or adulterer, may as wel maintain
 his filthie lust; because it is said of the defiling of Dinah,Gen. 34.7. that it was, res illicita, an vnlawfull thing, which the spirit of God needed not to haue noted so distinctly, if hee had thought, that no deflowring of virgins had been lawfull.

The man that taketh his brothers wife, committeth an vnlawfull thing, rem facit illicitam. For if some marriage of a man with his brothers wife were not lawfull, what needed Moses at the Commandement of God to haue noted so distinctly, the vnlawfull marriage of the brothers wife?
Ignorant man, shall I say, or malitiously blinde, that either knoweth not, or dissembleth that which boies in the Schooles learne in their first rudiments, that Epithets are vsed, not so much for distinction sake, as by way of amplification and exaggeration: and yet, as though the former of distinction were only in vse. So the Iesuite peruerteth the place of S. Peter, who vsed the Epithet of abominable or vnlawfull, when he said, abominable idolatrie, exaggerating the heinousnesse of the offense, because idolatrie is the greatest and most heinous of all sinnes, as himselfeDe Idololat. li. 1. ca. 2. elswhere truly prooueth out of the holy Scriptures.
Thus by the verdit of Gods word, and testimonies of the ancient Fathers, the Papists stand conuicted of idolatrie; thereby shewing themselues to be the off-spring of these old Heretikes, theEuseb. histor. Eccl. l 2. c. 13. Simonians, theJ^^nae. li. 1. ca. 24. Gnostiques, theEpiphan haeres. 27. and 79. Colliridians; and to be those false Prophets, and rauening Wolues, clad in sheepes-cloathing, of which our Sauiour heere giueth warning, Beware of false Prophets. And so I come to the third instance, which is their Miracles, alleged commonly
 as an argument; as for other points of their doctrine, so for the worshipping of Images. The confutation of the one will be the ouerthrow of the other.
Now concerning these false Prophets, wee haue our Sauiours prediction, Matth. 24.24. There shall arise false Christ, and false Prophets, and shall shew great signes and wonders, so that if it were possible, they should deceiue the very elect.
As then our Sauiour teacheth vs by the parable of the figge-tree,Matth. 24.32. when her bough is tender, and it bringeth foorth leaues, wee know that Summer is neere; so likewise when wee see and heare the signes and wonders whereby the Church of Rome laboureth to commend vnto vs many her nouell and superstitious doctrines, and amongst them the worshipping of Images, wee may by them take perfect notice of the comming of Antichrist, which the holy Apostle foretold should be,2. Thess. 2.9.10. by the working of Satan, with all powers, and signes, and lying wonders, and in all deceiueablenesse of vnrighteousnesse: which in these latter ages of the doting world we haue seene accomplished in the false Prophets of the Romish Synagogue.
For amongst them, their images, for example sake, haue beene seene,Concil. Nicen. secund. ^ction. 4. to sweat, to weepe, to laugh, to distill drops of dew, with which, diseases haue beene cured, to shift themselues from place to place, yeaPreuiarium Rom. in festo S. Thom Aquin. to speake also; thereby to conuince the Prophet Dauid of falshood, who saith of them, They haue mouthes, and speake not, Psalme. 115. verse 5.
TheAction. 4. Fathers of the second Nicene Councell are frequent in this argument, reporting that a woman sicke of the palsie, praving before the image of S. Anastasius, rose vp whole and sound. Another possessed with a foule spirit, brought before the same Saints image at Rome, was so cured. And that a man molested with the diuell, was by him told, that if he would not haue him struggle and wrestle with him, he must beware that he worshipped no more the image of the Virgin, bearing Christ in her armes, as
 she is vsually painted. WhereuponCarol. magnus de imaginibus. l. 3. c. 31. Abbot Theodorus inferred, that a man were better frequent all brodell houses, then to omit the worship of that image.
Examples of this sort are infinite, it being an endlesse trauell to recite the only bare names (asIn his Epistle to the king, prefixed before the miracles of our Lady of Mont-aigue. Robert Chambers a fugitiue Priest saith) of those who haue laudably, as he supposeth, imploted their labours heerein. And therefore, omitting others, I commend only to your consideration that pamphlet translated our of French, by him, into our mother tongue, of the Miracles lately wrought before the Image of our Lady of Mont-aigue, in the Low Countries, and dedicated not long since to the Kings Maiesty. These in his Epistle dedicatorie, he auoucheth to be semblable to those diuine operations whereby the Sauiour of the world did manifest his godhead to the world. For (saith he, turning his speech to the King) heere your Grace may behold, how the blinde see, the deafe h^are, the lame walke, the Diuels are expelled, the Leapers are cleansed, and many other painfull, deformed, and desperate maladies are cured.
Indeed our Sauiour said little more, when hee would shew to Iohn Baptist, his two Disciples, that hee was that Christ, foretold by the Prophets, to come into the world, for the redemption of mankinde.Matt. 11.45.6 Goe (saith he) and shew Iohn what things yee haue heard and seene; the blinde receiue sight, and the halt goe* the leapers are cleansed, and the deafe heare the dead are raised vp, and the poore receiue the Gospell. And blessed is he that shall not be offended in me.
The greater is the blasphemie of this Popish Priest, to ascribe that to a wodden image, which was the handy worke of Christ, God and man, the Sauiour and Redeemer of the world: yet what he briefly repeateth in his Epistle, is to be read at large in the historie of these miracles; in which hee is so confident, that he saith, It cannot be imagined that his royall wisdome would passe them ouer, as though his Grace had no apprehension of them. Yet to make his imagination the more sure and strong, hee gathereth together the reasons
 and arguments which his great Masters allege for proofe of the miracles wrought in the Romish Church.
Epistle dedic.And first (saith he) where miracles are seene to fauour the persons or things that appertaine to their congregation; who can denie, but that God is well pleased with them, and well alloweth of their rites, faith, and profession?
Will he know who can denie this? I will not now answer him with the authoritie of the ancient Fathers, of whom I shall speake heereafter; neither of all the reformed Churches in Christendome, which happily in his eies are but deformed. His fellow Priest,In his answer to Suttl^ffe his appe^dix, fol. 179. Matthew Kellison, in effect denieth it, acknowledging that Simon Magus, Montanus, Maximilla, and the Gnostique Heretikes, deceiued many by their illusions, and that Antichrist at his comming shall seduce many moe. As much doth Cardinall Bellarmine, reciting out of Valerius Maximus, and M. Ciero, miracles wrought by the Pagans, as that a Vestale Virgin drew water in a siue; that a Southsaier cut a whetstone with a rasor. Which ifDe notis Eccles. 4. c. 14. Bellarmine set light by, as though they were, as hee calleth them, leuia, light, and of small account, yet those which are recounted by the same Valerius,Tit. de miraculis. li. 1. ca. 8. may not bee so answered.
As namely, where the image of fortune is reported to haue said to the Matrons and Ladies of Rome, Rite me Matronae vidistis, riteque coluistis: Ladies and Matrons, yee did rightly see mee, and as well consecrate me. For as vnlikely a Miracle as this is chronicled in their reformed Roman Breuiarie, of theInfesto S. Thom. Aquin. Image of the Crucifix; before which, Thomas of Aquine praying, he heard a voice (theAntonin. his. par. 3. ^it. 23. c. 7. Crucifix spake it) Be^e scripfistide me, Thoma: Thomas, thou hast written well of me. Which is true, if that bee true which hee wrote, that theTom 3. quaes. 25. artic. 3.0. image of the Crucifix was to be worshipped with latria, such worship as wee giue to God: for thereby hee maketh the Crucifix a God; which is well, I trow, for the Crucifix.
Will any man thinke, that hath eies in his head, that
 both these miracles came not out of one shop, from one and the selfe same forge?
The same Valerius reporteth, that the Chapell of the Salij being burned, nothing was found in itPraeter lituum Romuli. ib. besides Romulus his deuming staffe. The like is recorded amongst the miracles wrought by our Lady of Mont-aigue, thatPa. 278. certaine Heretikes ransacking her Chapell, and burning the foormes and seats, and other things of wood within it, yet the Chapell tooke no fire, although they laboured to burn it also.
Besides these reported by Valerius Maximus, what shall be said of that whichJn his life. Suetonius writeth of Vespasian, that he restored sight to a blinde man by spitting into his eies, and healed another of a lame leg or thigh, by touching of him with his heele? as also of that which AeliasIb. Spartianus recordeth of Adrian, that hee restored one to sight, that was borne blinde: of that which IuliusJb. Capitolinus reporteth of Antoninus, surnamed the Philosopher, who by his praiers procured lightning from heauen, to set his enemies engines on fire, and rain for his armie, when they fainted with thirst? of that whichLib. 4. c. 12. Philostratus hath co^mitted to writing of Hercules and Apollonius Tyanaeus, that they raised vp the dead to life. These and such like, Bellarmine must not blow away with his breath, terming them light; for greater miracles then these, are not recorded in the moste lying and fabulous legends of Saint Francisco, Saint Dominick, Saint Antonie of Padua, of Franciscus Xauerius out of the Indies; or out of the Low-countries of the Image of our Lady of Mount-aigue.
If Chambers his reason bee good, it followeth, that God was well pleased with these Pagans, and allowed of their rites, faith and profession, because miracles fauoured their persons, and then let the Papistes see what will become of their Church, whichBellar. de notis Ecclesiae. l. 4. c. 14. they say, is knowne by her Miracles; when the Pagans miracles are as glorious as theirs, what distinctions can the working of miracles make? TheyArte daemonis opera diaboli. Bel. vbi supra. And Chambin his Epist. will say,
 that these miracles and cures wrought by the Pagans, were no true miracles, but were done by the aide and assistance of the Deuill; bee it so, and what hindreth, why wee may not answer in like maner, (as Bellarmine doth) of the cures wrought at the image of our Lady of Mount-aigu, if any were wrought, and such like? thatDiabolus infi^ens, in ocu^^ vnius, et al^e ^^s tibia, imped^chal vsum eorum membro, rum, idque eo fine, ^t videretursanare, cu^ de sineret nocere. Bel. ib, the Deuill being in the eye of one, in the leg of an other, and so in the rest, which are reported to haue beene cured, hindred the vse of those members to the end that our Ladie (to speake with the Papists) might seeme to cure them, when the Deuill did desist and leaue off to hurt and hinder them.
But miracles (saith Chambers) are works that surpasse the power of any creature, and therefore where God vouchsafeth to worke any miracle in the defence or honour of any person or any point belonging to any religion or beleefe,In his Epist. such a miracle is, as it were, his verie word.
I answer, if we take miracles in a strict sense, for such works as are done against nature, as to stay the course of the sun in the firmament, to ra^^e downe Manna from heauen, etc. So, the holy Angels themselues, as by themselues, can worke no miracles; much lesse the Deuill or any his instruments, Antichrist or false Prophets whatsoeuer; neither are they such that are wrought before the Image of Mont-aigu: but if we will speake as Saint Augustine doth, and call that a miracle,miraculum voco, quicquid a^d ^^ aut insolit^m supra spem aut facultatem mirantis apparet. de vtil. credendi c. 16. which beeing hard or not vsual, appeareth to be doone beyond the hope and abilitie of men that wonder at it; as it is commonly taken, sueh miracles the deuils can work, and false Prophets and sorcerers by his assistances, and not onelye the holy Angels. But these are no way to bee compared with the authoritie of Gods word, in as much as true miracles themselues, without their dependence and congruitie with the Scriptures, cannot now adaies giue any credit or authority to any point of Doctrine or Religion. And therefore S.Ecclesiam suam d^mostrent si possint, no^ in sermonibus etc. no in signis et pr^dig^s fal l^cibus etc. sed in prescripto legis, in Prophaetarum predictis etc. hoc est in omnibus canonicis sanctorum libroru^ authoritatibus. de vnitat. Eccles, c. 16. Augustine hauing to deale with the Donatists, in the question of the Church, prouoketh and calleth them from their signes and wonders, to the praescript of Gods word;
 which is the touch-stone of all miracles, asIn c. 24. Mat. fol. 542. as Ferus rightly obserueth from the testimonie of Moses and our Sauiour: vpon which, hee groundeth this true conclusion: Doctrina non ex miraculis, sed miracula ex doctrina probanda sunt; that doctrine must not haue his proofe from miracles, but miracles from the truth of doctrine: howsoeuerIn his epistle dedicat. Chambers most vntruly, if not blasphemously, auerreth, that miracles are more euident proofes of a true Religion, then are the Scriptures.
Jbid.But God (saith hee) being truth it selfe, cannot by his omnipotencie giue his testimonie to any error or falshood: aend being very goodnesse it selfe, it is impossible that hee will permit vs to be seduced by any his extraordinarie supernaturall operations, etc. Which as I willingly acknowledge to be true, in the elect; so I further adde, that God permitteth Satan and his members sometime to worke miracles, not to the end that he would thereby giue credit and authoritie to their false doctrine and haeresies: but asIn c. 24. Matht. Ferus andPromp. nor. pars aestiual. dominica 24. post Pentecost. Stapleton his Doctors obserue, and that truly, ad probationem bonorum, excaecationem vero malorum; for the proofe and triall of the good his chosen, and excaecation of the wicked and reprobate: According heerein with Moses, Deut. 13.1.2.3. The Lord your God prooueth you, to know whether yee loue the Lord your God, with all your heart, and with all your soule.
But miracles haue beene alwaies in the Church, from her first infancie, and so haue continued from age to age, euen to our times, asLi. 4. de Eccles. c. 14.Bellarmine obserueth, which toIn his Epist. dedicatorie. Chambers seemeth an argument vnanswerable.
We answer, not as he vainly conceiueth, that all such histories are fictions; neither, by bare and incredulous denials, as he would make vs, but we distinguish the times, acknowledging that in the primatiue Church, miracles were truly wrought; the exigence of the times so requiring, when the doctrine of the Gospell was strange, new, and incredible to the naturall man; and, as S. Paul saith,1. Cor. 1.23. to the Iewes a stumbling blocke, and to the Graecians foolishnesse: which gift
 continued in the Church vntill both Iewes and Gentiles were generally gathered to Christ his flocke. And yet, what small force there was in miracles, euen in those times of themselues, to bring men to the truth, when God with-held the inward operation of his holy Spirit, by the efficacie of the word preached, is manifest by some vnbeleeuing Iewes, who ascribed the miracles wrought by our Sauiour himselfe,Matth. c. 9. v. 34. etc. 12. v. 24. to the power of Beelzebub the prince of the Diuels.
As for the miracles of the latter ages, wee answer withDe vnitate Eccles. c. 16. S. Augustine, Aut non sunt vera either they are not true, such as are many the Legendarie Fables, and the miracles wrought amongst the Indians, by Franciscus Xauerius, and others of that crew, as theBellar. de notis Eccles. li. 4. c. 14. Iesuites report: Aut si haereticorum aliqua mira facta sunt, or some of them are true, as Haeretikes and Impostors in all ages haue wrought some, and still doe by the assistance of Satan; and then we are to be the more wary of them, asDe vnitat. Eccles c. 16. S. Augustine teacheth vs, as beeing wrought by the permission of God, for the triall of his children, and further obdurance of the wicked.
And that we make no more reckoning of their miracles, they must not take it amisse at our hands: the wiser and better learned amongst them haue taught vs to doe so, if wee knew it not before.Aliquando fit in Ecclesia maxima deceptio populi, in miraculis fictis a sacerdotibus, etc. Gloss. in c. 14. Daniel. Lyranus acknowledgeth, that the people are sometimes much deceiued in the Church by miracles made by Priests and their consorts, for worldly gaine. And for the Writers of the Legends of their Saints, which are full fraught with them,De vanitate scientiarum, ca. 97. Pietatis loco ducunt, men dacia pro religi ne fingere De traden disciplinis, li 5. Cornelius Agrippa giueth this testimonie of them, that they doe miracala fabricare, and confingere terribiles fabulas, make miracles after their owne deuices, and faine terrible fables. Ludouicus Viues saith, that they hold it for a point of godlinesse, to coine lies in defense and maintenance of Religion. And2. Tim. 4. d^gress. 21. Claudius Espencaeus, that no stable is so full of dung, as the Legends are of fables; and that very fictions are contained in their Portesses. SoApparat. sac. tit. Apochry. Posseuine the Iesuite, the Criticke of our age, confesseth, that many histories of the Saints liues are so written, vt haereticis subsannandi,
 cordatis dubitandi, pijs lachrymandi occasionem praebeant; that they giue occasion to Heretikes (it is the liuery which the Iesuite bestoweth vpon vs) to laugh in their sleeues; to men of courage and iudgement, to suspect them; to deuout and godly men, occasion to weepe and lament them. But of all others, their Bishop Canus setteth them foorth in their colours. First he saith that the Historiographers amongst the Gentiles, Laertius, Suetonius, and such like,Longe incorruptius and integrius, etc. Loc. Theolog. l. 11. c. 6. fol 333 wrote the liues of their Philosophers and Emperors, with much more integritie and sinceritie then their Catholikes had wrote the liues of their Martyrs, Virgins, and Confessors: whichDolenter hoc dico, potius quam contumeliose, ib. hee vttered not by way of reproach, but from the very griefe of his heart. He saith further, that whil'st they follow their fond affections too much, they make vsTales diuos quandoque nobis exhibent, quales diui ipsi et si possent, esse tamen noluissent, ib. such Saints sometimes, as the Saints themselues, if they might, would by no meanes bee such in very deed. Of which sort, the examples are so many, that they cannot be numbred for multitude. He addeth further thatOlent aut quaestuosorum hominum imposturam, aut quod Gelasius ipse ait, haereticorum foetu^. ib. they sauour eith^r of the imposture and deceit of couetous men; or, as Pope Gelasius saith, of the vntimely fruit of Heretikes,res diuorum praeclare gestas non se putant egregie exposituros, nisi eas fictis and reuelationibus and miraculis adornarint, ib. who thinke they cannot declare the noble deeds of Saints excellently well, vnlesse they garnish them with fained, both reuelations and miracles. His censure of the golden Legend is this, that a man may oftner read in it miraculorum monstra, monstrous miracles, rather then true: branding the Compiler of it with that marke whichSueton in vita Neronis. Licinius Crassus set first vpon Domitius, thatHanc homo scripsit ferreioris, plumbei cordis, animicerie parum seueri and prudentis, Canus ^b. he was a man of an iron face, and a leaden heart, and a minde neither seuere nor wise. To Diuines hee giueth this holesome admonition; that they doe not forthwith perswade themselues, that all things are absolutely perfect,Quae magni authores scripserint. nam and labuntur aliquando, and indulgent ingeniorum suorum voluptati, vulgoque, ib. which great Authors haue written, because they slide sometimes, and follow their owne wits will, and yeeld too much to the common people. In this ranke he placeth his Pope Gregorie, and our Venerable Bede; the one in his dialogue, the
 other in his English historie, inserting such miracles, as were vsually inMiracula scribunt vulgo iactata and credita, quae huius praesertim seculi Aristarchi incerta esse censebunt. Ib. euery mans mouth, and commonly beleeued: which the rigid Censors of this age, would iudge and repute for no better then vncertaine. And speaking of Vincentius and Antonine, he saith thatVterque non tam dedit operam, vt res veras certasque describeret, quam ne nihil omnino praeteriret, quod scriptum in schedulis quibuslibet reperiretur. Jb. they both endeuoured, not so much to describe matters true and certaine, as that they might not omit ought that they found written in euery scrole and cast peece of paper.
Now if the case thus standeth, as the learned Papists themselues deliuer, not onely with the Legendaries, with Vincentius, and Antonine; but also with S. Bede and Pope Gregorie, yea with holy men and very great; that they haue after this manner stuffed the historie of their Saints, with such prodigious and monstrous false miracles; is it not a wonder to behold this punie Priest Chambers, after the iudgement and censure of so many learned reputed amongst them, so boldly to insult, and beare himselfe vpon the miracles, collected out of their Chronicles and Legends,In his epist. dedic. as though no men were able reasonably to make answer to this historicall demonstration, gathered before to his hand, by his greatBell. de notis Eccl. l. 4. c. 14. Master Bellarmine?
Yet will not this true answer of S. Augustines giue him satisfaction, vnlesse we be able, by some ancient andIn his epist. dedic. authenticall Chronicles, Records, Doctors, or learned Writers, to note the time when God with-drew his powerable hand from these kindes of supernaturall workes, or that euer they should end so long as his Church should last.
Heere then let Chambers heare the record of S. Augustine, whom hee calleth (and that worthily) the renowned and famous Champion of Gods Church; who to some demanding of curiositie, why those miracles were not wrought now adaies, which were done in the times of our Sauiour and his Apostles? I might (saith he) answerPossem dicere necessaria fuisse priusquam crederet mundus, ad hoc vt crederet mundus. De ciuit. Dei, li. 22 c. 8. that miracles were needfull before the world beleeued, that so by them, the world might beleeue. But hee that still requireth miracles, to make him beleeue, magnum est ipse prodigium, qui mundo credente, non credit;
 himselfe is a great wonder and miracle, who beleeueth not now that the world is brought to faith and beleefe. Of which assertion of his, concerning the ceasing of miracles, after that the world was brought to the faith of Christ,Nunc signorum petitio tentatio est. hom. 23. in Euangel. Iohan hee giueth many reasons in other his Treatises. As in his booke de vera Religione, c. 25. this amongst others, ne animus semper visibilia quaereret, that the minde of man should not still seeke after things visible,Et eoru^ consuetudine rigesceret genus humanu, quoru^ nouitate flagrauit and mankinde wax cold through the daily vse of miracles, with the noueltie whereof it burned with zeale at the first. And de vtilitate credendi, c. 16. quia non mouerent nisi mira essent, at si solita essent, miranon essent: because miracles would not mooue men, vnlesse they were wonderfull, and wonderfull they would not be, if they were vsuall.
With Saint Augustine accordeth Chrysostome, affirming that the asking of Miracles now adaies, is a tempting of God. And to the question that some then made, as the Papists do now, why are not miracles wrought as in former ages? hee returneth this answer,Si fidelis es vt oportet, si Christum diligis vt diligedus est, non indiges signis, signa enim incredulis dantur. ib If thou bee faithfull as thou oughtest to be, if thou loue Christ as thou oughtest to doe, thou needest not signes and miracles; for these saith he, are for vnbeleeuers.
So theNunc signoru^ operatio o^nino laeuata est, magis aute^ et apud eos inuenitur, qui falsi sunt Christiani, fieri facta. ho. 49. author of the vnperfect worke vpon Saint Mathew his Gospel, the working of signes and miracles is now ceased and at an end, and it is found to be done rather amongst them qui falsi Christiani sunt, who are false Christians: let the Papists if there be any heere present, mark the euidence that this author giueth.
In these steps of S. August. and Chrysostome, treadeth their Pope Greg. Miracles (saith he)Signa necesria in exordi^ Ecclesiae fuerunt. Vt enim ad fidem cresceret multitudo credentium, miraculis fuerat nutrie^da, etc. hom. 29. in Euangel. were needful in the church in the beginning thereof, when faith was to bee nourished by them; as men doe water plants which are newly set vntill they haue taken roote; which being done, the watering ceaseth; and so say I doe miracles in the Church. So likewise our EnglishNumquid quia ista signa non facimus, minime credimus? sed haec necessaria in exordio Ecclesiae fuerunt. l. 4 in Mar. c. 16. Bede, what saith he? Doe we not beleeue, because wee worke not these signes and miracles? but these were needeful in the beginning of the Church. And b Isidor Hispalensis: The
 reason why the Church worketh not the same miracles which were done in the times of the Apostles is,Quod nunc Ecclesia non ea miracula faciat, quae sub Apostolis faciebat, ca causa est, quia tunc oportebat mundam miraculis credere, nunc vero iam credentem, oportet bonis operibus coruscare, de summo bono. l. 1, cap. 27. because the world was then to be brought to faith by miracles; but now beleeuing, it must shine with good workes. And againe,Iam in fide miracula quicunque requirit, vanam gloria^ vt laudetur, quaerit. ib He that now requireth miracles when faith is planted, seeketh after vaine glorie, that hee may be praised: he proceedeth further, and auoucheth in plaine tearmes, thatAntequam Antichristus appareat, virtutes ab ecclesia et signa cessabunt, vt per hoc sanctorum clareat patientia, et reproborum qui scandalizabuntur leuitas ostentetur, et perseque^ tium audacia ferocior efficiatur, ib. miracles shall cease in the Church before the comming of Antichrist, whereof he alleageth these reasons; that by this the patience of Saints may bee famous; and the leuitie of the reprobat, which are offended, may bee shewed; and the boldnes of persecutors may bee made the more fierce.
To this graue testimony of the ancient Fathers, I will add the witnes of some of his owne writers, that the neglige^t stupiditie of this Popish Priest may be seene of all men more apparantly. Amongst them, Catharinus in his discourse of the worshipping of Images, hath this saying in the end of his treatise,Non dico vt inde (a cultu imaginu^) expectent oracula and signa, quae rara sunt, neque curiosis conceduntur, nec expediret imperfectus ea dari, perfectis autem minime necesse est. etc. Men should not looke for Oracles and Miracles from the worship of images, which (saith hee) are rare, and not granted to curious persons; neither is it expedient that they should bee giuen to men that are imperfect; and as for such as are perfect they neede them not. Stella saith, thatMiracula potius nu^c da^num nobis offerrent, qua^ commoda. Puer enim quando ambulare incipit, adiunatur vehiculo, at si homo adultus etc. in Luc. c. 11. miracles now a daies, would rather hurt then profit vs: as props which are needefull for Children to learne to goe by, are a hindrance vnto them, when they are growne to mans estate; so (saith hee) if Miracles were wrought now adaies, men would be offended by them, and say that our Faith were not as yet wel grounded: beware therefore, lest it befall them to demand a signe at Gods hand* satis sint tibi signa vetera, let the old signes and miracles suffice, and do not now seeke after new. As much saithPromisit Christus vt discipuli daemonia ^ijcerent quam promissionem, nullu^ his diebus effectum sortiri dilucide cernimus, etc nec tame^ inanis illa promissio fuit, quam noluit efficaciam habere perpetuam, sed pro tempore nascentis et adolescentis Ecclesiae. De captiuit. Babilonica adu. Luther. c. 10. par. 4. Fisher, sometimes
 bishop of Rochester. Christ promised that his disciples shold cast out deuils, which promise we see to take no effect now adaies; because no man now doth cast out Diuels bodily, nor cure diseases, yet was not that promise of our sauiours vaine, which hee would not haue to be alwaies effectuall, but for the time wherein the Church was borne and grew vp. With whom accordeth also our vnnaturall Countriman Thomas Stapleton.Vt opera miraculosa tunc necessaria erant ad fidem hominum animis ingenerandam, sic postea bona opera Praedicatorum necessaria sunt ad fidei opera producenda. Prompt. moral. dominic. 2. aduentus. As (s^^th he) miracles were needfull in the times of our Sauiour, that faith might bee bred in mens hearts; so afterwards the good workes of Preachers are necessarie, to bring foorth the workes of faith. Which he confirmeth with the testimonies of S. Augustine and Gregorie, which ye haue already heard.
Now then, if S. Augustine, Chrysostome, Gregorie, Bede, Isidore, be ancient and authenticall Doctors; if Catharine, Stella, Roffensis, Stapleton, be learned Writers, as I assure my selfe Chambers dareth not gainsay; then we haue from them an answer to his demand, and prooued out of them, which he saithIn his epist. dedic. can neuer be done, not only that true miracles and wrought by the finger of almighty God, are ceased in the Church, and the time when, (namely, when the world was generally brought to the faith of Christ:) but further, that such as in the cleere Sun-shine light of the Gospell, yet require miracles still, as the Papists doe, doe tempt God in so doing, that they are infidels, without faith and beleefe, that they loue not Christ as they ought to doe, that they are false Christians, and hunters after vaine glorie. All which conuince Chambers of much ignorance, both in the ancient Fathers, and his owne moderne Writers; and argue much folly in him, to conceiue, not only of his Maiestie (whose wisdome and learning all that know, admire) but of any of vs, that we should be so simple and credulous, as to beleeue those miracles, which the most learned amongst them reiect as fabulous and foolish, as hath beene shewed.
It irketh me to follow the pursuit of this ignorant Priest, who from his blunt arguments commeth in the end to the
 vsuall Popish rhetorike of railing and reuiling, tearming vs Heretikes, and spending his iests vpon vs;Ib. who therfore thinke miracles superfluous, because we can worke none, as the fox will eat no grapes, because he cannot get them.
But laying aside all bitternesse and scurrill iesting in matters so weighty and serious, and to speake the words of truth and sobernesse; we therefore thinke miracles superfluous vnto vs, not because we can worke none, which we acknowledge, and therefore we attempt none; but because we professe the same doctrine which our Sauiour and his Apostles, and such Apostolike men as succeeded in the Primitiue Church, haue confirmed to our hands, by so many true signes, and diuine miracles, which all belong to vs and our Church, who professe the same faith which our Sauiour and his Apostles preached.
As for the faith of the Church of Rome, as it is new and strangely degenerating from the ancient Catholike faith, so it is no maruell if it bee confirmed by new miracles, which are of the same nature with their new faith; false, both the one and the other.
And yet to stop the mouths of our insolent aduersaries, which are alwaies craking of their miracles; if with a single eie they will looke vpon our Church, they may in it, and amongst vs, behold such miracles as make greatly for Gods glory, our priuate comfort, and the true honor of our Church.
For both the restoring of the puritie of religion, in these late times, from the drosse and corruptions of Antichrist, was not without the extraordinary and powerful working of almighty God; and the preseruation thereof vnto this day, mauger all the conspiracies and forces of our enemies against our Princes and our people, are such as euince sufficiently, that it is the Lords doing, and it is wonderfull in our eies.
Againe, if they will obserue the fruit and efficacie of Gods word sincerely preached amongst vs, they may from thence beholdDe verbis domini secundum Matth. serm. 18. See Chrysost. hom. 6. in c. 2.1 ad Cor. And Greg hom. 39. in Euangel. And Bernard. ser. 1. in ascensione Domini. And Raban. in Psal. 9. Maius fuit Paulum paersecutorem conuertere, quam Lazaru^ de monumento suscitare, ib. Quae miracula tanto maiora ^unt, quanto per haec non corpora, sed animae suscitantur. Gregor. supra. maiores sanitates, as S. Augustine speaketh,
 those greater cures and greater wonders wrought amongst vs in our Church, euen those cures and wonders for which our Sauiour and his Apostles did vouchsafe to worke minores illas, those lesser cures vpon mens bodies.
For although now adaies coeca caro non aperit oculos miraculo Domini, the blinde man is not restored to his sight by our Lords miracles; yet cor coecum (...) oculos sermone Domini, the blinde heart of man openeth the eies of his vnderstanding, by the efficacie of his word preached amongst vs. The carcase that lieth dead in the graue, is not raised vp; but the soule that lieth dead, euen in the liuing body, by reason of sinnes and trespasses, is quickned amongst vs, by the preaching of the Gospell: the eares which were deafe before, and stopped at the crying of the poore; the hands which were fast bound and shut from their releefe, are open to heare their groanes and requests, and loosed liberally for their comfort.
Witnesse your owne eies and eares this very day, heere at home amongst your selues, which may heare and see the multitudes of Christ his poore and distressed members; most charitably and carefully releeued in yourSee the number of these poore, affixed to the Psalme of thanksgiuing, sung by the children of the Hospitall, vpon Munday in Easter weeke. 1609. Hospitals, to the great glory of God, the comfort of the poore and afflicted, and the eternall memorie of the worthy founders and benefactors of the same.
Witnesse abroad the planting intended, or rather already happily begun of our English Colonie in Virginia, whither the charitie of our late Souereigne of all blessed memorie Lady Elizabeth, and of his most excellent Maiesty now reigning, assisted with the godly indeuours of many chiefe and of principall note in this noble Citie, hath extended, to their great costs, labours, and perils, for the gaining and winning to Christ his fold, and the reducing vnto a ciuill societie (as hope may iustly conceiue) of so many thousands of those sillie, brutish, and ignorant soules, now fast bound with the chaines of error and ignorance, vnder the bondage and slauery of the Diuell.
Which being the principall scope of this businesse, wee
 may with Gods blessing assuredly expect the fruits which vsually accompany such godly enterprises; as are the honour of his Maiestie, whose name shall by this meanes be glorious vnto the ends of the world, the enlarging and further strengthning of his Realmes and Dominions, the easing of this Land, which euen groaneth vnder the burden and numbers of her i^^^bitants, the plentifull enriching of our selues and our Country with such commodities as she now laboureth with the penury of them: all which, and many other of this sort, I wittingly passe-ouer, as hauing beene at sundry times and places, by diuers of mor^ abilitie and leisure, commended to your godly considerations: nothing remaining to be said by mee in this kinde, but that with all thankfulnesse we acknowledge, and with most hearty praiers wee commend to almighty God the happy preseruation and continuance amongst vs, of that noble instrument of his glory, our most gratious Souereigne Lord King Iames, by whom he effecteth so powerfully his miraculous workes now adaies in our Church, to the wonder and astonishment of the world, not wilfully malignant.
Thus if need were, we could speake, and that without vanitie, of the true miracles of our Church: as for those false and fabulous sorts which I haue touched, I leaue them to those Mirabiliarij, asTractat. 13. in Euangel. Johannis. S. Augustine calleth them, our Popish miracle-mongers, by which they are descried to be the very limmes of Antichrist, and naturall brethren of these old Heretikes, theAug. de haeres. c. 24. Seuerians, and theId. de vnitat. Eccles. c. 16. and tractat. 13, in Johan. Donatists, and therefore those false Prophets of which our Sauiour forewarned vs, when he said, Beware of false Prophets.
The fourth instance which I proposed as a note to distinguish the true and false Prophets, is their life and conuersation; which answering to true faith and doctrine, is a note of the true Prophet, it being sincere and holy, as otherwise if corrupt, a signe of the false. ForChrysost. ex varijs in Mat. locis, hom. 11. Indicium me^tis operata hominis, a mans work is the manifestation of his heart and minde, and thereforeQui ouium indumento co^tecti, quod profitentur, infamant, qui aliud docent, quam faciunt, etc, ib. though hee bee cloathed with
 the Sheepes weede, if he teach one thing and doe another, if hee be a shame and obloquie to his profession, he is a false Prophet,Ibid. as Chrysostome rightly obserueth from the words of our Sauiour, ye shall know them by their fruites.
Heere then if I should goe about to rip vp the liues of the Romish Praelates: as there would be no end of it, so the sauour therof would be most vnpleasant and offensiue to your chast senses; which I could make euident, not as they do from the slanderous reports of Bolseck, Coclaeus, Staphilus and such companions, against our reuerend Pastors, Luther, Caluin, Beza, to whome they were professed enemies: but out of their own writers, and some of them so neere, as that they were eye-witnesses of the things which they report.
Tacitus said long since of Rome heathenish,Quo cuncta vndiqueatrocia ac pude^da co^flu unt celebra^turque Annal. l. 15. That all shamelesse and heinous enormities ran into it, as into a common sewer, which Theodoricus ofCu^ Nilo porte^ta paris, nutris crocodilos, etc. de scisma l. 3.6 41. Niem one attending sometime on the Pope, maketh good vpon Rome popish applying certaine verses vnto it, wherein it is compared with Nilus which bred monsters, and nourished Crocodiles. And there Saint Bridget affirmed, that she heard the blessed Virgin saying to her Sonne, thatRoma^ esse ferace^ agru^: respondisse vero christu^, est, sed zizaniae catalog. test verit. to^. 2. pag. 800. Rome was a fruitful field, to whome Christ should answer, it was so indeede, but the fruitfulnesse thereof consisted in tares.Epistol. 20. Petrarch calleth it the mother of al Idolatrie, the refuge and Sanctuarie of all errors.Ministri christi sunt, et seruiunt Antichristo. ser. 33. in Cantica. Bernards complaints are not so many, as iust; he saith of the whole Clergie, that in name they are the Ministers of Christ, but in very deede the Seruants of Antichrist, whose sins were growne to that height, asVitia nostra eo creuere, vt vix apud deu^ misericordiae locum nobis reliquerint, in vita Marcel. 1 Platina one of the Popes Secretaries reporteth, that they scarcely left any roome with God for his mercie. Now all these, and many of this sort put together, say no more then what PopeNos scimus quod in hac sa^cta sede, ia^ annis aliquot multa fuerunt abhominabilia etc Nec miru^ est, quod infirmitas a capite in me^bra, a Papis in minores prelatos deriuarit, etc. paralipome^ ad Chro.

Adrian the sixt gaue his Legate in charge to confesse before the States of Germany at a meeting of theirs, that Rome had for many yeares together offended, and that many waies, and that allPlurimis. nunc annis grauiter multisque modis p^ccatum esse Romae, et inde a Pontificio culmine malu^ hoc atque luem ad inferiores omnes ecclesiarum Praesectus defluxisse. Slei dan Commentar. l. 4. this corruption, and infection, flowed from the Pope, as from the head vnto the inferior and lower Praelates; according with the Prophet

Habetis confitentem reum, ye heare the Pope answer guilty to the crimes obiected, what neede then haue wee of any more witnesses? IfDecima nota est sanctitas vitae Auctorum siue primorum patrum nostra religionis. De notis Eccles. li. 4 cap. 13. sanctitie of life, especially of chiefe Pastors, be a note of the church, as Bellarmine saith, then a contrario, the wicked and abhominable life of our Romish Praelates, argue sufficie^tly that they are the false Prophets of which our Sauiour gaue vs this watch-word, beware of false Prophets. Whereby it appeareth what may bee inferred vpon that Antecedent, whichIn his preface to his Detection of Master Iewels errors and lies. Thomas Harding himselfe maketh and acknowledgeth. What if Popes haue suffered great Princes and Monarkes to kisse their feete, to hold their Stirrops, to leade their Horses by the Bridle? What if a Pope shewed himselfe cruel and without pittie, in suffering Francis Dandalus the Venetians Ambassador to lie vnder his table like a Dog, whiles he was at dinner? What if Pope Alexander vsed Fredericke the Emperor more proudly, then became a man of his calling? What if the Popes at certaine times cared not, or, for the wretchednesse of Mans ill inclination could not, or for greate considerations would not vtterly purge the Citie of Rome, of Curtesans and Brodel-houses? What if the life of many Priests, Bishops, Cardinalls yea of some Popes also, hath iustly deserued to bee reprooued? must this now bee made a good argument; some of their liues were sinfull, ergo their Doctrine was false? Not so M. Harding, wee conclude not so, but wee infer out ofHom. 11. ex variis in Mat. locis. Chrysostom andDe notis Eccles. l. 4. ca. 13. Bellarmine: the liues of many your Popes and chief praelats, were moste sinful, flagitious and heinos: therfore they were no sound members of the true Church; but such false Prophets, as beeing cloathed with Sheepe skins, are not-withstanding inwardly no better then rauening Wolues.
How then commeth it to passe (belooued in the Lord) that this famous and ancient City of London, the Mother Citie of the Kingdome, the beautie and glorie of the land, is become a cage of these vncleane and filthie Birds, and a Den for such rauening wolues, as thirst after nothing more then your blood, and that not of the bodie alone,
 but much more of your soules?Gal. 3.1. haue yee beene deliuered from the bondage and darkenes of Aegipt, into the glorious libertie of the Sonnes of God, and sun-shine light of the Gospell, to returne againe in your hearts, into bondage and darkenes, more then Aegyptiacal? Shal I demand with the Apostle, Who hath bewitched you that yee should not obey the truth? Are they these popish Syrens, with their alluring songs of hope, and expectation of a golden day, so long expected, and so hopefullie conceiued in the declining age of that most renowned Q. Lady Elizabeth, our late Soueraigne? But the tune of that Song is altered, (God haue the glorie for it) and they lament anotherwhile (and so may they euer) with O spes fallaces, O our deceitfull hopes, our vaine dreames, our idle imaginations:D. Bishop in his Epist. to the King. the state is now setled (they say) and so let it be, O Lord, euen for euer and euer) and a continuall posteritie is like to ensue of one nature and condition, Amen Lord Iesu. Is it the splendor of their miracles, which so long haue dazeled the eies of the World? but these are conuinced to be false and fabulous; or no better, then the workings of Satan, and illusions of Antichrist. Is it the sinceritie of their doctrine? but that is no better then the Beggars cloake, patched together of olde haeresies, long since condemned by the Catholike Church, as in part hath been shewed, and may as easily be proued in the rest.See Faxa sacrae panitentiariae. They rob God of his honor, and giue it to stockes and stones: they take Christ his office from him, and ioyne Saints with him in his Mediatorship, Gods sacred word is but a bable with them; and of no worth, in regard of their traditions, and vnwritten verities: their religion is the high way to Atheisme, and al impiety; there beeing no sinne so heinous, so enormous which they dispense not with by their indulgencies: and pardon by their absolutions, incest, rapes, murders, vowes, periuries, all veniall, so money be not wanting.
Their profession is knowne to be the dethroning and murthering of princes: and for their practise it is the vtter ouerthrow of ciuil states, and societies, by swearing and
 forswearing, by Aequiuocating and dissembling, taking aaway all truth and sincere dealing from amongst men. As for their life and maners; no puddle is more impure then this sinck:Rom. 1.26.28. et v. 21. and that by the iust iudgement of Almightie God, God giuing them vp to vile affections, and to ^ reprobate minde because that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankeful, as the Apostle speaketh of the Gentiles, and is as truely verified in the Romanists.
So that if any man heere present, will still bee misled and seduced by the false Prophets, notwithstanding the warning that hath beene giuen, I must pronounce of him, (though with much greefe of heart) that hee is guiltie of his owne blood,Eccles. 33.4. his blood bee vppon his owne head; for my part, I say, as (...) is in the Prophet, for the integritie of my conscience, and discharge of this duetie, liberaui animam meam, I haue deliuered my owne soule, now look ye to it.
But for you (belooued in the Lord, of whome we haue perswaded our selues better things, and such as accompanie saluation) stand fast, I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, in the Doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles, which yee haue receiued, grounded vpon Christ the Cornerstone, and sealed vnto you with his blood, and with the blood of his holy Martyrs in all ages; and beware of false Prophets, beware of these Sheep-skin'd wolues: trie their spirits, examine their faith, looke into their manners: by these fruits you may know them; and knowing them, auoid their steps which leade to hel and destructio^. Which that yee may bee able to doe, that God of mercies, and father of all goodnes, which commanded the light to shine out of darkenes, illighte^ the eyes of your vnderstandings, confirme you with his grace, and guide you with his holy spirit amidst the stormes of these last and perilous times, that so in the end yee may ariue at the hauen of all blisse and happinesse. Amen.
FINIS.
