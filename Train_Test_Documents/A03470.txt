when in a other cup of massy gold they crown her wine that sparkle to and fro it be the king confessor cup of old who live a marry man and die a maid she kiss the cup where grave she may behold Actaeon death and down it quick lay then turn a little to her maid aside rebuke their want of secrecy and say can you no better your own counsel hide but over England too it must be blaze lo here Actaeon in his horn hide while on our shame and nakedness he gaze therewith she pawze but they no word can say so be they at that lively map amaze and sure the cup do all so well display as if it

one that half abash be unto the queen she turn and utter this alack alack if his own hound do tear this fond Actaeon yet the fault be he and my the grief we god be no less sorry for mortal punishment then for their amiss though we by this and that declare our glory and our own justice in they both exalt yet some will say and they too peremptory that this his fortune be and not his fault be it not his fault so to profane a place that hallow be with frankincense and salt be it not his fault that shall surprise your grace here in your chamber scare you or your train and from your side your sure servant race abortive fancy swim about his brain and fail he when himself he most assure run all his plot and purpose in vain that shall the like attempt on you or you thus end she and with this speech the day on steal the night that part still procure as though it come to bid she come away then take she leave and in her coach do climb the eastern hill with horse iron gray where in slow minute she must tell the time and serve the use of man God bid she so when neither cock do crow nor clock do chime whether we see her silver face or no yet there she walk as well by day as night and still about her crystal or be do go but lord with what a long and delight to Windsor ward she down will cast she look and guild the wide Thames with her tremble light another heaven you will have think the brook with moon and star and here and there a cloud but in high heaven what way so ere she take queen Katherine praise there she ring aloud set to the tune of she well temper sphere much more harmonious than be harp and crowd Hermes that all the ghost below can rear and gentle usher with his snaky rod to this new carol give ' attentive ear and as he be a very prate god to the bright Venus have it tell anon from the first point to the last period when she in all the haste will needs be go to see below what all have hear above of England queen and peerless paragon her coach be draw by many a turtle-dove and drive by a coachman of great worth her little son the mighty god of love so long he guide on his course by north when have past the seven and utmost clime out of the sea he may see peep forth a spot of earth as white as any lime to which he think it best his course to hold now be the earth for it be pass the prime that have unmask she of her tawny old revest with a flowery diadem and new green velvet spangle all with gold thus be the field enamel all of they along the silver Thames that do embrace the golden mead in wanton arm and hem their loose skitt like a indent lace acrosle and up and down the river swim her sacred swan who when they see her grace unto her coach to do their homage come and from the land come turtle many a pair unto her deity who do the same then Cytherea see they so repair bespeak sir boy we sure be go amiss but yet the best be this the way be fair nay doubtless that no way to Windsor be but to our palace in mount C^theron and Cupid he be sore afraid by this lest it be so indeed when have go a little further he may plain see where with his eye a castle meet anon high on a hill as though it scorn to be build on the base earth and tower above the lofty cloud with such a majesty as say it can not be the court of love how often have you see together dwell the lordly eagle and the low dove or love and majesty concord well by this they to the castle-gate be come that be shut in by warning of a bell in every room yet stir hear they some which make they loud call and loud knock yet none no more than if they have be dumb will answer they a long hour by the clock they wait there now he now she now both Cupid at last do peep in at the lock yet no man come then Venus wax wroth and since of force she must her purpose miss to be revenge she take a solemn oath and say much worship have we win iwis if thus one silly woman may abuse two such great godhead if we suffer this what wretch I pray you may not well refuse to burn on our high altar his perfume and by this precedent the fact excuse whether she on our gentleness presume or her own greatness all be one for that I shall ere long so pull her peacock plume that though she now be young and fair and fat she shall no soon look upon a glass but she shall grieve and sore repine thereat and say that now be hay be sometime grass think she to escape our hand so frank and free that she forsooth of France the daughter be England fresh bride and thereby chance to be mother to he that now be king of both alas what be all this to a deity no more but title and mere toy in troth as than she have deserve so shall she have divine revenge come sure though late and loath belike these giddy french think they may brave my son and i at pleasure leave undo what at their hand most lawful we crave or do all lawless outrage under sun they make but can a woman and a child of i and thou and thereby think to shun our vengeance this it be to be so mild to malefactor that for very spite our temple and our altar have defile leave unprofane no religious rite but havoc make of holy maidenhead as if the charge we have renounce quite that appertain to the bridal bed wherein the lawful heir beget be who after nine month full finish the shamefaced father shall not fear to kiss at midnight to he by the midwife bear yea he himself will swear it to be his when Lucifer let forth the blushy morn but if they still my patience thus shall wrong by s. Adonis here lo have I swear and will not fail I shall ere it ^e long a plague send on they that will quick tame their pride and teach they sing another song it shall feed in their marrow like a flame and rage through every corner of the land that of the nation it shall take the name but to the point that now we have in hand which to effect with more successful speed son Cupid you awhile my friend must stand mother quoth he to fear you shall not need for I have still be your obsequious son and still will be in thought and word and deed yet hold I not this dame so much a nun by nature as by virtue of the clime be far remove northward from the sun for she have love and so may do in time the bird that have once escape the net defy the fowler may be catch by lime or other engine that for he be set and so may she by some more quaint device but what that be myself know scarce yet maugre her heart all be it make of ice gramercy son quoth he why then no doubt though she be ten time more than she be nice this act we shall bring well enough about but that I fear i which you late tell about the climate all this isle throughout be all the let that ever happen can for though the sun now in the lion reign and his meridian yet a uncouth cold i think do hit i now through every vain in Africa if the lion list to rage who shall he from his lady side restrain yet here he sleep out his idle age and dream not once of nature kindly sport be it not this what grate or iron cage can coop he from his pleasure to be short the vine that with the scorch sun by noon grow quick ripe in France if you transport into this country ripen not so soon yet be the soil as thankful here as there yea the element all underneath the moon remove from their own place some otherwhere take new impression to they for the fire that only shine in his celestial sphere here burn most violent and with desire say Cupid shall this saint this Katherine in windshore burn who he do so admire the man of Monmouth when she do but shine in France at melaws like a blaze star who fair aspect and influence divine do stop the hoarse and open throat of war as there great Henry fall in love with she here of another shall she dote as far except my cunning or this hand do err and that rich dowry yea be it ten time more upon a subject shall I soon confer what on a saxon Cupid will you so now by this mole quoth she upon my cheek I rather have this high revenge forego which I on she so thirst do seek then any flinty Saxon shall succeed a prince so mighty and a prince so meek these saxon clean have wash away my seed swallow the fat soil like another flood those sturdy saxon who the stone do breed which Pyrrha when yet all the earth be mud by devilish divination backward throw to take the form of flesh and bone

safety from the foe foul entreat they indeed and word long be they tear and toss thus to and fro now foil and then foil till at the last Edward the first their fate ordain so to make they subject to

mother say he your swan shall not exceed this eagle nor your dove hereafter shall she stoop so to the lure though now a while the cloud she tower above for her pure bosom with a brand as pure I will so kindle yet before the sun get out of Libra that none may recure her heart but only Owen well say son he answer she why shall I then despair but as one Owen have we all undo another Owen may those harm repair for who do know but that in time to come there may spring from this well consort pair may I will so bless and fructify her womb h. 7. that seven time happy man who one day sit on this throne and thence with mercy doom his and my people o when will that day shine from the east upon this northern clime then then may well both welsh and english say that they be bear in a most bless

hill lead forth his flock and home again by this how shall the struggle bride against her will with her impatient love this night conceive unless your gracious influence do fill her fruitful lap god must not therefore leave to help and comfort mortal man because of their due honour they the god bereave this say he stay and with this only clause she condescend that all shall be do as that herself thereto her best applause shall give and that as soon too as the sun a judge between the night and day become o silly queen these snare how can thou shun and how o Venus have thou any shame can thou

to some glad heart seem to the sorry slow and dull as lead than first the queen do lift her droop eylidde from the earth below as one that have hoard up his chief his only treasure still his eye do throw back to the place as to his best relief so be the queen and all the court to gloze the more with she do flatter this her grief for like the prince the people they compose move for their sake God

all apparel be in blue step forth at last and make curtsy low begin aloud most mighty queen to you in humble manner we present this show a silly maid a widow and a wife as by our habit you may partly know a late between we happen heavy strife whether the wife the widow or the maid live the most happy and content life all what we can we three therein have say and woman as man clatter want no word yet here alas the matter have not stay for act it must needs be by the sword of martialist but your majestic hand that unto miser mercy still afford the same by your authority with stand which be so sovereign and do carry weight with all the mighty spirit of the land that end all this stir will here be straight eight hardy squire do hold of maidenhead whereof be Owen Tudyr chief and eight maintain that it much better be to wed the last eight by like argument approve the life sequester from the nuptial bed renown empress then let pity move your royal breast to save they from the spoil what heart of iron have she that do love to see one man in fight a other soil or once abide to see the blood to stream that in the manly bosom wont to boil here at as one awake out of a dream the soft sigh queen up start soon guild the world with such a glorious beam as do the sun this hemisphere by noon with morning shower though somewhat endeavour or as when in some misty night the moon break through the cloud and show her silver head and thus she speak you virtuous maid and wife for such you seem and thou who half be dead who other half resolve to lead the life that also do thy queen not all this i will a fit one can yield to stint your strife extend out though it lie many a mile and but the sea abide not any bound for all three course have I know awhile a very maid of i king Henry find who soul God pardon and to mercy take to who my love my faith keep ever sound that all the world my honour may not shake ne wrack my fame against so foul a shelf as unto he so for his only sake I will remain no less true to myself for Henry wife and widow will I die honour vain pleasure transitory pelf I force not of such gaud a whit not I yet do this trash the mind of many tempt to love delight from who vile tyranny prince no more than other be exempt but only he I love so do I now and ever shall of who both thought and dream I have so oft that no man else may bow my settle heart only be he alive he may perhaps prevail against my vow and God I beg it now so let i thrive if aught I speak the world good word to woo beyond my worth but with his thunder drive i quick those ugly shade of hell into before o shamefastness that I forsake thou or yet any law of thou undo may I with i my little Henry take to some remote and solitary den your noble prince his servant God he make whereto the people cry amen amen I can be well content no more to come among the press and multitude of man not that I doubt but virtuous there be some I know there be and many in this place this of my speech then be the very sum that oft alone when I recount my case no life i think be like to widowhood so God but guide it with his holy grace hereat the maid and wife atone stand mistake i not quoth then the lovely queen for often have it be no less a good to marry well then to live single see perhaps the more if heart as well as hand be right tie the marry pair between not altogether wed unto land ne wealthy dowre ah never may she thrive that on the purse above the party stand she that so wed as I know none that do beguile her husband he have but the hive another eat the honey God forbid that ever any courtly dame shall carry a heart so base within her bosom hide as for myself have I not love my Harry perdie I make a vow that for my part no kingdom can have tempt i to marry against the love and like of my heart but ah not long have I enjoy my joy when ugly death come steal with his dart for hand of man can never he annoy and he of life and i of love deprive yet have he leave behind a princely boy that in my breast his heavenly shape revive so like the father do he daily grow as any you have see in all your life yea like he he already learn to go so will he bend the brow so will he look his eye his hand he cast he carry so but whither have I like a wander brook thus err by love few liquid pearl than gush from out her eye and there her breath she take but lord than how the lovely virgin blush when all the people do the queen pursue with fresh applause till when all be hush the queen do her continue speech renew lady it seem and therewithal she sit it seem I say to we that each of you so please be with her peculiar state that all the world may not your will reclaim i lief also wear your love then hate whereat no virtuous prince do ever aim tyranny fear and fear this hate beget what duty then can want a privy maim that of the subject love proceed not I then conclude no kind of life amiss that be so fix and altar not a jot unhappy most the least resolve be when as the great commander in the war affect the merchant life the merchant his who know each crooked motion of the star the clerk again envy the courtier and he the clown to leave particular in we and you for oft thus one may err I must I hope to none of your disgrace together when all course I confer of force define that both resign the place to maidenhead as copper do or brass when India gold their glory do deface a worthy wife no doubt Susanna be redeem from death as she be thereto lead yet do the widow judith she surpass who smite off as he breathe his last abed that horrid head yet breathe war and lust but unto MARY well of maidenhead this and that other yield of duty must the maid where three time three month do repose the sun in who repose be all my trust a virgin be but even a very rose for once if hand of man thereon be lay both send and colour it will quick lose so tender in the bloom be every maid that innocent and ever happy state have our forefather not so fond stray wherein God human nature do create in holy maidenhead resemble be whence have fall too soon we grieve too late when all the world do point at our amiss then see we naked shame with open eye yea maidenhead go far beyond all this for in that earthly place of paradise as here we do they do by God behest but in that heaven where his own owner lie as be his angel such be all the rest maid and unmarried here than I conclude that maidenhead of all be only best and as she say so say the multitude then all three lady who do now relent and pardon ask that they have be so rude beseech the night in sport may now be spend who so to do with many thanks she pray so they unto the four and twenty send to certify they what the queen have say and therewithal to bid they haste away the messenger so do and they obey alack for pity now what shall I say a wily traitor and a very thief that all the while in ambush close lie among the masker be become the chief and to the castle be already come good queen I fear i to thy further grief herewith be hear the trumpet and the drum as if they have be march for the field by two and two they enter all and some each after other offer up his shield while she that in all curtsy do abound to every man particular thanks do yield the soft music than begin to sound and eke the lady be have out to dance it also please the queen to walk a round the courtly sport the more to countenance with who because he do the measure lead to couple it be Owen happy chance then all in order begin it soft tread up and down in and out the planet seven rapt with harmonious sphere as we may read so dance about the lofty pole of heaven the measure end it grow very late for it be half a hour nigh past eleven then bid the queen that one below the state a stool for she shall set upon the ground this do anon down thereupon she sit some in their cinqueapase do nimble bind some do the cros-point some high caper cut and on the toe some other turn round while still the minstrel on the tremble gut strive with division to outrun the time that haste on the revel up to shut for midnight now the clock begin to chime then issue Owen out among the rest reserve until then as only prime of all the masker and the very best love that do all the while no wile forsloe that help to set afire her snowy breast resolve at last that it must needs be so wherefore as Owen do his galliard dance and grace it with a turn upon the toe whether his eye aside he chance to glance and like the lovely God become so blind or else perhaps it be his happy chance I know not and record none can I find this be the short the queen be very nigh he fall and as he forward down decline his knee do hit against her soft thigh I hope he feel no great hurt by the fall that happy fall which mount he so high for up he quick spring and therewithal he fetch i such a frisk above the ground that o well do cry out both great and small the queen arise then and deal thanks around to all of they but unto Owen most the trumpet also they begin to sound for on she pass and after her a host of lovely lady while the people pray that God will guide she with his holy ghost thus all the court be very well apay and every dancer in delight do swim but Owen only who be so dismay that all the company come to comfort he among all one wish it have be his hap I can not blame he though he lose a limb that long to pitch in such a princely lap but out alas what shall there more be say this be but even a engine and a trap that for the silly foul be late lay the fair foul I ween that ever be this only trick so foul have betray as into some one centre of the glass the sunny beam we do contract to light divine tobacco that all balm do pass because all union have the great might so fierce Cupid cause his fiery brand upon that eagle-eye of he to light that in the very turn of a hand reflect it may set afire her heart that obstacle none may it once withstand the wound do at the
