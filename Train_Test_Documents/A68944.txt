Thessal. 2. 7. s. Paul prophesy of the reveal of Antichrist say thus you know what withhold that he may be reveal in his time etc. which hindrance be the roman emperor which be first to depart from Rome and give place to the pope because both emperor and pope can not reign together in one city and that hindrance be take away long since when Constantine the great translate his imperial seat to Constantinople and endow the pope with the city of Rome and a great part of Italy lie about it the emperor then be far off and by reason of continual war with saracen and enemy in the east notable to maintain their own right in the west the pope encroach upon they too far and usurp so much authority that they discard they clean in Italy and at their pleasure set up other emperor in the west but such as will take a oath to be subject to the apostolic see of Rome and acknowledge the pope to be universal bishop so the hindrance be take away when Constantine remove to Constantinople and Antichrist be manifest disclose not long after when Boniface the three obtain the title of universal bishop which be 900. year ago for as Gregory say none but Antichrist will assume unto he such a title but yet Constantine have no regard to any prophecy when he remove at first from Rome to Byzantium and there settle his imperial palace but he respect only a more commodious government of those matter and kingdom of he that lie eastward which at that time be miserable disquiet by the parthian and persian for Constantinople do seem to be so situate whereas otherwise Constantine have once think to have settle elsewhere as that it be as you will say the navel or midst unto the whole roman jurisdiction which as we know spread itself far and near and yet it can not possible otherwise fall out because that so the roman empire may become double head and have those two horn which God before have reveal so the providence of God guide this whole enterprise of Constantine and so fulfil what himself have decree hereby you may perceive two cause wherefore Constantine remove from Rome 1. the first more secret in the providence of God that the prophecy of the apostle Paul 2. Thessal. 2 7. may be fulfil 2. the second more public and better know to all viz. that Constantine the great emperor of the roman seek to resist the course and robbery which the parthes daily use towards the roman deliberate to transport the empire into the east part and there to build a large city which first he mind to have build in and afterward in Troyada a country of high Pmygia near unto the cape Sige^ in the place where sometime stand the city of Troy which he begin to re-edify and to repair the foundation thereof but be by a revelation in the night inspire to change the place cause to be recommence the work of Chalcedon where certain eagle as Zo^arus write be fly thither take in their bill the mason line and cross the street let they fall near unto Byzantium whereof the emperor be advertise take the same for a good sign and divine instruction after he have take view of the place call back the master of his work from Chalcedon cause the city to be repair and amplify which according to his name he call Constantinople notwithstanding that at the first he have call the same new Rome whereupon it come to pass that both in general counsel and in the decree of emperor mention be make of two Rome one the old which be the true Rome build by Romulus the other the new which be Constantinople which also begin to hold up the head by virtue of the privilege and prerogative of old Rome Constantinople be call by the turk Stambolda Constantinople be likewise call Ethuse and Antony but by the grecian Stimboli and of the turk Stambolda which in their language signify a large city and so it be call by they at this day the emperor now see his city build and sufficient people compass the same with wall tower and ditch build therein many sumptuous temple adorn it with many magnific building and necessary work as well public as private and afterward for the more beautify thereof cause to be bring from Rome diverse antiquity worthy of memory and among other the Palladium of ancient Troy that be the image of P^llas in Troy which he cause to be set in the place of Placote the great column of Porphyre which be set up in the same place near unto which he cause to be erect a statue of brass to the likeness of Apollo of a marvelous bigness in which place he ordain his name to set up but in the time of the emperor Al^xis Comine this statue through a great and impetuous tempest be cast down to the ground and break all to piece this emperor live there many year most prosperous in happy estate as likewise do many of his successor but not altogether exempt from persecution as well by war fire pestilence earthquake as sundry other calamity until such time as God purpose to punish the people for their sin through negligence of emperor stir up Mahomet the second of that name and the eight emperor unto the turk who be move with a earnest desire to bring the christian unto decay and thereby to augment his empire be beyond measure jealous to see this noble city so flourish before his eye go with a marvelous power both by sea and by land to give a furious siege unto the city the end and issue whereof be such that after a long siege battery and diverse assault the jnfidel have get the wall with a great hurly-burly and fury enter into the city where at the first entry they make the death of Constantine the emperor a maruellou slaughter of the poor assiege christian without spare any age or degree the emperor Constantine they kill in the press as he though to have save himself and after that they have cut off his head in derision and ignominy they carry the same upon the point of a spear round about the camp and city and afterward Mahomet not content himself with the violate and deflower of the emperor wife daughter and other lady of honour by a savage cruelty cause they in his presence to be dismember and cut in piece during the time of the sack which continue three day there be no kind of fornication sodometry sacrilege nor cruelty by they leave unexecuted they spoil the incomparable temple of s.

which be at Rome moreover there be conduit pipe and diverse cistern vault support some by vault and other some by a great number of pillar and diverse other fragment of antiquity there be also two place in Constantinople at this day Bezestan like unto the exchange in London call the bezestan distinguish by these name the old Bezestan and the new Bezestan wherein all sort of commodity be to be buy as in the royal exchange in London and great variety as velvet silk and satin and waste-coat ready make of all sort of silk fine quilt and curious wrought with curious handkerchief of exquisite work and many other commodity which be too long to set down but these bezestan be not open all the day but at certain hour uz. from nine of the clock in the morning to three or four in the afternoon and not every day neither but on certain day in the week there be also a usual market in Constantinople market of man wherein they sell man and woman of all age as ordinary as we do cattle in England which be for the most part christian such as the turk take captive in Hungary or other place where they overcome their custom be to make slave of all they can take alive and at their return to sell they in the open market if christian be move in compassion to buy they because they be christian the turk will sell they exceed dear to they but cheap to a musslelman as they call themselves that be true believer but if they can get their own price for they they will enforce they to turn turk and to serve they in all servile labour as the israelite do the egyptian upon the corner of the city of the seven tower which stretch towards gall^poly near unto the sea side there be a very strong castle compass with 7. great tower and environ with high and strong wall well furnish with artillery which castle be by the turk call jadicule but common the seven tower for the keep whereof there be a captain call Disdaragla a man of great revenue and authority which ordinary have under he 500 dead pay

have always there keep the treasure and yet the grand-signior come thither very seldom this castle also with seven tower common call the seven tower be a prison for great man like unto the tower of London there be also two other strong castle which I have see towards the black sea call mare Euxinum wherinto they put prisoner of who they make great account and for who they expect great ransom at the black sea we see Pompey pillar of marble erect one a rocky island near unto the shore whereon some of our company write their name viz. master Robert young gentleman who also there write the name of our noble prince HENRY nathaniel persivall John milwarde Thomas Marson and other and on the shore near unto the black sea there be a lantern as high as steeple and on the top thereof a great pan of liquor in dark night continual burn to give warning to ship how near they approach unto the shore for it be a very dangerous shore and it be therefore call the black sea not because the water thereof be any whit black than other but from the dangerous event because in black and dark night many ship be cast away rush either upon rock or sand as the red sea also in Egypt be not therefore call the red sea because the water thereof be red than other but as some think because the water be turn into blood when Moses wrought miracle before Pharaoh but this reason I do not so well approve because we do not read that the sea be turn into blood but the river so that they can not drink of the river nor the fish live therein but I like better of their judgement who say it be call the red sea because of the red gravel and red bulrush which still grow in great abundance by the shore thereof the black sea be not far from Constantinople for we take boat from thence in the morning and be at the black sea before noon and have see Pompey pillar we go on shore and take wine and other victual with we up into the lantern and there dine and return to Constantinople by supper time my brother Peter biddulph in right humble manner salute you and that virtuous gentlewoman your wife I understand by a letter which I late receive from he date at Anchona that he have be at Rome in the year of jubilee but at this present he be either in Venice or in some other principal city in Italy where he cut diamond ruby saphier emrod and all other sort of precious stone I write for he to come unto i to Aleppo in Syria to be factor for a worshipful merchant of our company but he answer i that he have learn not to be another man man so long as he can be his own according to that versicle that be let not he a man servant be who can live well and may be free whereby I perceive that his purpose be to follow the trade of a lapidary and buy and sell precious stone which he buy rough and rouge and when he have smooth they and curious wrought they than he sell they again yet I expect his come hither before many year be expire for I understand he have a purpose to travel to Spahan in Persia and to other of the chief city there to buy precious stone which be bring thither from India and other place and his direct way thither be to travel through Syria and from thence to Babylon in Assyria wherefore I make account he will visit i in his journey thither and I doubt not but he will salute you with many letter before his departure out of Christendom for he write unto i that you by your kindness have bind he unto you in bond of perpetual gratefulness which though he be unable to requite yet he be not unwilling to record he have be in most of the chief city in Italy Germany and the low country and in Geneva Savoy Spain and in all the chief city of France and be better able to acquaint you with the state of those country than I be to who I refer you for satisfaction of your expectation therein many other matter I have to acquaint you withal concern the manner government religion and discipline of the inhabitant in these country but fear to be overfedious unto you by interrupt your serious affair with over and superfluous writing I surcease for present any further to sillicite you of the rest hereafter if God permit if you write hereafter unto i direct your letter to Aleppo in Syria for there I hope to be before your letter can come and from thence shall you hear from i interim vale sum BIDDULPHUS a letter write from Aleppo in Syria Comagena wherein be discourse of a voyage from Constantinople to Syria with such memorable matter as be observe in the way and of the religion government manner life and custom of the turk moor arabian greek and other nation there dwell of sojourn **** @ etc. albeit dear friend since my come into Syria which be now 2. year full expire I have not as yet salute you with any letter notwithstanding your often provoke of i by your letter to more diligence in writing yet I pray you impute it not unto i for ungratefulness or forgetfulness for no continuance of time or distance of place shall make i forget you for although I be now many thousand mile distant from you yet I have change but the air I remain still the same man and of the same mind according to that old verse though speak in another sense that be they that over the sea from place to place do pass change but the air their mind be as it be and God forbid I shall forget you for I have learn that he who have deserve well ought not to be forget but with all duty of love and kindness remember and regard and that foul vice of ingratitude I have always abhor yea the very suspicion thereof I have ever detest as a vice most odious and detestable both to God and all good man wherefore if all love require love again I be most unkind if I will not requite your love towards i with mutual love and grateful memory but the cause of my long silence have be rather a desire to see you in presence than to salute you in absence for I be weary of this uncomfortable country and do think of have repair towards my native country long before this time which I desire as earnest to see as Ulysses do to see the smoke of his country before he die and pray with the banish man in his exile God grant I may die in my own country yet when I remember how the heathen man can comfort himself in his calamity ovid. and say God will give a end to these misery Aeneas and again perhaps it will delight we to remember it hereafter I a poor christian live among heathen man do comfort myself with this confidence that he which bring jacob from Padan aram in Mesopotamia to his own country in safety after twenty year service and naomi after ten year sojourn in idolatrous moab to Bethlehem Ephrata her own country the same god in his good time will bring i from this heathenish Babylon to Israel his people and english Zion where with the true israelite the remembrance of Babylon will make i sing more sweet in Zion in the mean time though I want the sweet society comfort and conference of you and other my kind friend who remembrance be comfortable unto i yet I will not cease by writing to supply that duty which I can perform by speak hope and expect the like from you for nothing can be more comfortable to i in this strange country than often to hear from my friend and by mutual writing to be acquaint with the affair of each other the doleful and lamentable beginning of your last letter make i exceed sorrowful queen Elizabeth be famous throughout the whole world and her death bewail by heathen people for therein you acquaint i with the death of bless queen Elizabeth of late and famous memory at the hear whereof not only I and our english nation mourn but many other christian who be never in Christendom but bear and bring up in heathen country weep to hear of her death and say she be the most famous queen that ever they hear or read of since the world begin but the end of your letter comfort we again and mitigate our mourn and give we occasion to use that verse of Sibyl concern the branch of the holy tree virg. Aenid li. 6. aureus and when one bough break be another spring as fresh in sight of gold and twig be ever like with bud of metal bright and as my duty be I appoint one day to be keep holy which we spend in prayer and preach and thanksgiving unto God for the happy advancement of so noble wise learned and religious a king over we and in sign of joy we feast and triumph in such sort that the very heathen people be partaker with we of our joy and I beseech God continue such joyful day unto our land so long as the sun and moon endure amen now because the nature of man be desirous of news and as it be say the first question of a Englishman what news I know you expect from i to hear of such news as this country afford wherefore in some measure to satisfy your expectation as in my former letter direct to you from Constantinople I acquaint you with my voyage thither and such antiquity and memorable matter as I see and observe there so the subject of this present letter shall be my voyage from Thracia to Syria with such observable circumstance as I have note there since my come into this country and first of all I give you to understand that after my departure from Constantinople the first place we touch at be the 2. castle at the Hellespont about 220. mile distant from Constantinople where the order be for all ship to stay three day to the end that if any slave be run away from their master or thief have steal away any thing they may thither be pursue in three day before the ship pass and then at three day end that be good forbid the ship must be search for good and the grand-signior pass show for all the passenger in the ship and then their usual duty pay they may set sail and away yet if the master of the ship pay extraordinary they may more speedy be dispatch and many give very liberal when they have a good wind rather than they will be stay many hour from thence we sail between Moeotis and Tenedos Pontus in the sea call Pontus for although sometime in the poet every sea be call Pontus as Ovid in his book speak Ponto that be all be sea on every side and no firm land can be espy and again Pontus and I see nothing but the air above and the sea beneath yet

west Egypt on the north Cilicia on the south Arabia Assyria join unto Syria and have on the east Media on the west Mesopotamia on the north Armenia Minor on the south susiana about sixty mile from Aleppo the river Euphrates and Tigris meet at a place call vulgar beer or birha but of old it be call Mesopotamia Mesopotamia where Laban dwell at Padan aram. and there be yet a heap of stone within

also govern by turk it border upon Persia a great part of Mesopotamia and Assyria be also call Babylonia of the city Babylon also there be a city in Egypt call Babylon not far from the i will delta build by certain babylonian betwixt Aleppo and Babylon merchant travel often over the desert of Arabia and every quarter of the year caravans come from thence with many hundred camel lade with merchandise and their custom have be pigeon carry letter and be still sometime when they have occasion to send some sudden news from Babylon to fasten some brief writing to one of the wing of a bagdat or babylonian pigeon or about her neck in such sort that it may not hinder she fly and to send she therewith to bring news to Aleppo which be at the least ten day journey off which when I hear at the first it seem to i wonderful strange and almost incredible but after I understand how they train they to it the strangeness thereof be diminish for when the hen dove sit or have young one they take the cock pigeon and put he in a cage and when the carrier go with their camel they set the pigeon in a open cage on a camel back and when they be a day journey or two from home set she at liberty who present mount up aloft and behold her way never cease fly until she come to her mate which any of the house perceive look for some paper fasten about she and so in post haste understand speedy news and so by degree they train they further and further to the place of their traffic this I have know put in practice and perform by a english merchant of Aleppo who in such sort send a pigeon to Scanderone three day journey from Aleppo and by her return understand when ship arrive thither and depart from thence which seem not unto i so strange as that which we read of perform by a cobbler of Rome who teach a daw to speak and to salute the emperor as he pass by with these word Caesar which the emperor hear give unto the cobbler a good reward and buy his daw which another poor man in Rome perceive hope to get the like reward take upon he to teach another daw the same lesson and day and night as he sit at his work use still to prattle unto his daw and bid he say salve Caesar and when he perceive he can not make his daw once frame himself to pronounce those word he chafe rap he on the bill and say that be I have lose my labour in vain yet still continue his diligent endeavour and by often repeat both salve Caesar and in the end his daw have learn both the one and the other and when the emperor pass by say salve Caesar the emperor answer that be i have such saluter enough at home whereupon the daw reply which the emperor hear buy this daw also because he have one lesson more than the other and reward the poor man well for his labour I be bold to write unto you in absence as pleasant as I be wont to speak unto you in presence whereby you may perceive I be still the same man and of the same mind and as merry out of England as ever I be in England but to proceed in my discourse and description of Syria a description of Syria all Syria of old be call aram and the syrian aramite but especial I do read of three of the chief city in Syria call by the name aram the

God be a great God and one only God and Mahomet be the prophet of God in this commandment they acknowledge a god and also Christ they acknowledge to be a great prophet but deny he to be the son of God for God say they have no wife and therefore can have no son but Mahomet they hold to be a great prophet than Christ and the last prophet of all for it be a common say among they that Abraham be the friend of God Moses the messenger of God Christ the breath of God and that Mahomet be the prophet of God they speak reverent of they all four and punish as well those that blaspheme Christ as those that speak evil of Mahomet yea they acknowledge Christ to be the son of the virgin Mary but not to have be bear according to the common course of nature but to have proceed from her breast and as for his conception by the holy ghost they know not what it mean neither do they know whether there be any holy ghost or not but in their prayer they often reiterate these word together hu hu hu that be he he he in despite of all the christian there be but one god he he he alone be God for they hold because we acknowledge three person that therefore we worship three god and they acknowledge but one God and be altogether ignorant of the trinity in unity and unity in Trinity the second commandment be concern their duty towards their parent in these word 2. obey thy parent and do nothing to displease

but very fair church and high steeple and at the hour of their public prayer they be call to church by the voice of crier who go up into their steeple and cry with a loud voice come now and worship the great God and sometime also thus Eillala Mahomet Resullala that be God be a great God and Mahomet be his prophet and sometime no more but thus Ollah that be God be alone that be there be but one God and oftentimes there be but one crier in one steeple but on their sabbath day which be Friday and at sundry other time there be many man cry and bawl in every steeple like a kennel of hound when they have start their game the first meeting at public prayer every day be before the rise of the sun the second be about noon or midday and on their sabbath day two hour soon and again at noon so that they pray five time every day and on their sabbath day six time the three time for public prayer every day be at the ten hour of the day call by the turk Kindi by the moor assera about three or

thereunto by outward wash of themselves in token of reverence and suffer no woman to come to their church lest the sight of they shall withdraw their mind from prayer and though they do not come to church yet when they hear the voice of the crier they will pray wheresoever they be and fall down and kiss the ground three time oftentimes also these crier walk about the steeple in the evening and sing after their rude manner David psalm in the arabic tongue and when rich man hear they sing well and with clear voice they be so delight therewith that they use to send they money their five commandment be concern fast viz. 5. that one moon in the year every one of any reasonable age spend the whole time in fast they have but one lend in the year and then they fast general in this manner when the new moon change which they call Romadan then during all that moon they fast all the day long betwixt sun rise and sun set and neither eat nor drink any thing at all but when the sun set than the crier call they to church and after they have pray than they may eat what kind of meat they will save swine flesh which be forbid by their law and as oft as they will until sun rise so that their Lent be but a change of day into night during this moon Romadan they observe this kind of abstinence very strict and so soon as the next moon change which they call byram than their lent end and they hold a feast for three day space together at which time they say Mahomet deliver unto they their law their six commandment be concern almesdeed 6. let every man out of his store give unto the poor liberal free and voluntary their alm be either public or private their public alm be a sacrifice or offering of some beast for a sacrifice unto Mahomet once every year which be kill it be cut into small piece and give all to the poor their private alm notwithstanding their law be much neglect for I have hear of many poor people who have die among they for want of relief and in the way as I have travel I have find some dead for hunger and cold and though a man be never so poor yet if he be not able to pay his head money to the king yearly they be beat and their woman and child sell to pay it i^ our murmur and impatient poor be here but a short time they will learn to be more thankful to God and man and how to esteem of a benefit bestow on they and not curse and revile as many of they do if any one that pass by they do not give unto they the turk be more merciful to bird cat and dog than to the poor their seven commandment be concern marriage 7. that every man must of necessity marry to increase and multiply the sect and religion of Mahomet their custom be to buy their wife of their parent and never to see they until they come to be marry and their marriage be nothing but enrol in the cadies book and it be lawful for they to take as many wife as they will or as many as they be able to keep and whensoever he dislike any one of they it be their use to sell they or give they to any of their men-slave and although they love their woman never so well yet they never sit at table with man no not with their husband but wait at table and serve he and when he have dine they dine in secret by themselves admit no man or mankind among they if he be above twelve year of age and they never go abroad without leave of their husband which be very seldom except it be either to the bannio or hot bath or once a week to weep at the grave of the dead which be usual on Thursday be the even before their sabbath which be Friday and the jew sabbath on Saturday and the christian on Sunday three sabbath day together in one country if their husband have be abroad at his entrance into the house if any one of their woman be sit on a stool she rise up and bow herself to her husband and kiss his hand and set the same stool for he whereon they sit and stand so long as he be in presence if the like order be in England woman will be more dutiful and faithful to their husband than many of they be and especial if there be the like punishment for whore there will be less whoredom for there if a man have a hundred woman if any one of they prostitute herself to any man but her own husband he have authority to bind she hand and foot and cast she into the river with a stone about her neck and drown she and this be a common punishment among they but it be usual do in the night and the man if he be take be dismember but the daughter and sister of the great Turk be more free than all other man and woman for when their brother die they live and when they come to year of marriage their father if he be live or brother if he be king will give unto they for their husband the great pasha or vizier who they shall affect and say unto they daughter or sister I give thou this man to be thy slave and bedfellow and if he be not love dutiful and obedient unto thou here I give thou a canzhare that be a dagger to cut off his head and always after those daughter or sister of the king wear a broad and sharp dagger and whensoever their husband which be give unto they by the king to be their slave displease they they may and do cut off their head they exempt no call from marriage but hold it a blessing from God to have many child and the desire of many child make they take many wife the great Turk have many hundred yea as I have hear a thousand woman only for his own use and yet as Augustus Caesar speak of Herod when he kill his own two son Alexander and Aristobulus with the infant of Bethlem rather than he will fail of his purpose in kill Christ it be better to be Herod hog than his son for his hog live but his son die so it be better to be the great Turk hog than his son for they be forbid by their law to eat swine flesh kill no hog but all the son of the great Turk be strangle to death by their elder brother after the death of their father to avoid treason a devilish policy Hatto and like unto that of Hatto a bishop of Mentz or Magunce in Germany who as the chronicle mention 500 year ago in time of a great dearth call all the poor people in all the whole country into a great barn pretend to make a great dole but have they sure enough he fire the barn and burn they all up say these be the rat and mouse which devour up the corn this be his policy to make bread better cheap but for this unmerciful mercy God make he a example for all unmerciful man to the world end for a multitude of rat come and devour he in such terrible sort that where his name be write in window wall or hang they never cease till it be raze out and drive he from house to house to save his life and where he have a strong tower in the midst of the great river of Rhine which yet stand there to be see in the midst of the river he think himself sure if he can fly thither notwithstanding the rat swim after he thither and there devour he and it be call the rat tower to this day as traveller know and I myself have see this present year 1608. july 7. it stand on a little jland in the midst of the river of Ryne betwixt the city Mentz and Cullyn or colonia near unto a town call Bingam on the one side of the river and another town call on the other side the river where be make the best rhenish wine in all not far from sanquer where there be a choler of iron fasten to a wall whereinto all fresh traveller be enforce by their company to put in their neck to make they free and be enhance at Bobar usual or at sanquer if they lodge there sultan Mahomet this great turk father when he come to the crown put to death 19 of his brother according to the custom of his predecessor as a wicked policy to prevent treason the persian be yet somewhat better although too bad where the elder son be king after the death of his father and all the rest of their brother have their eye put out yet live other turk have three wife and have as many women-slave as they can keep who they use as wife and esteem they equal with their wife the manner of their marriage be this first if a man like a young woman he buy she of her father and give a great summne of money for she and then enrol she in the cadies book that he have buy she of her father for his wife and then the friend feast and banquet together and this be all they perform in marriage only the father of the young woman give great store of householdstuff with she and this be carry open by particular through the street of the city on horse or camel and sometime by man and woman the party new marry go before with music play before they their eight commandment be the same with our six 8. thou shall not kill in their Alcoran it be write that God hate murder and they say that it be the second sin which creep into the world after the creation be first commit by curse Cain who kill his brother Abel and their belief be that this sin of wilful murder be impardonable but if it be by mere chance or in their own defence or else in lawful war or in case of justice by the magistrate they hold it lawful often have I hear turk brawl one with another and in word most vile revile one another but never do I see or hear of two turk in their private quarrel strike one another neither dare they strike one another for if they do they be present bring before the magistrate and severe punish yea if one do but lift up his hand to strike another he be cast into prison and keep in iron until he have pay some great fine or receive some other punishment but they will strike jew and christian oftentimes who dare not strike they again if a man in secret be kill and find dead either open in the street or private in a house the master of the house or the parish where he dwell must find out the murderer otherwise he himself shall be accuse of murder and both he and the whole Contrado where he dwell must pay unto the Subbashaw so many hundred dollar as shall be require at their hand and therefore the subbashaw oftentimes be wicked man do hire some desperate person to kill a man in the night that thereby he may take occasion to eat of the whole Contrado William Matrin dom. 1603. sept. 18. we have a english man not long since who sleep on the terrace that be on the top of the house in the night as the custom of the country be in the heat of summer who have his throat cut be asleep in bed by two or three wicked man who come from the street by a ladder to the top of the house and after they have commit this murder be descry by the bark of a dog and see also by the master of the house through his chamber windowwhere he sleep but not plain discern be somewhat dark they make haste down again and be never know leam saper but on the morrow after the master of the house a english man also be in trouble himself because he can not find out the murderer and it cost he a hundred dollar at the least before he can be free and the whole Contrado or parish be also fine in like sort if a house be rob he who be rob must either find out the thief or else he himself shall be trouble for it and put to a great fine if a house be but endanger by fire either by the burn of a chimney or any other small part thereof without great harm yet they will lay to his charge who dwell therein that he will have burn the whole city and take from he all that he have and imprison he as long as they please such secret murderer thief and violent oppressor be they though their law forbid murder and theft and they themselves know those to be guiltless who they * * turk call that eat which we call oppression or extortion eat upon and imprison yea Mahomet himself allow to his countryman the arabian that be to poor man accustom to live upon the spoil he allow theft and set a law of revengement hurt he say he which hurt you he say also he that either kill his enemy or be kill by his enemy enter into paradise and it be (@) unusual thing among they special for lenesary to kill their servant as butcher kill calf and throw they into a ditch when they have do and oftentimes for small offence lay they down on their ha^ks and (@) up their heel and bind their foot together and (...) a coul staff and with a great cudgel give they two or three hundred blow on the sole of their foot after which punishment they be not able to stand on their foot for the space of many day and some of they go lame always after servant there be as usual buy and sell in the market with they as bruit beast among we who they use as slave in all kind of drudgery it it better to be a servant in England than a master over many servant in Turkey these be the eight commandment of Mahomet but the two chief point forbid in the Alcoran be the eat of swine flesh and the drink of wine yet many of they drink wine until they be drunken but I never hear of any turk will eat swine flesh the thing consider be so fond and ridiculous it may seem strange that man of courage in Turkey do not forsake this deceiver and deluder of mankind but it be the less strange if we consider how he have fortify his law with four bulwark or strong defence 1. first he command to kill they which speak against the Alcoran and therefore no man dare gainsay or deny any thing contain in their Alcoran but whosoever shall dare either to dispute against that book or to doubt of any article therein write he shall be sure either to have his tongue pull out of his head or else his body to be burn and consume with fire 2. second he forbid conference to be have with man of a contrary sect or religion 3. three he forbid credit to be give to any beside the Alcoran 4. four he command they to separate themselves altogether from other man and to say let i have my law and take you you you be free from that which I do and I likewise from that which you do and herein I hold it better for merchant and other christian to sojourn and to use trade and traffic among turk than papist for the Turk give liberty of conscience to all man and like well of every man that be forward and zealous in his own religion but among the papist no man can buy and sell unless he bear the mark of the beast as s. John foretell revelation 13. 17. moreover to drive away all fear of damnation from the mind of his disciple Mahomet tell they that every man shall be save by his own religion he only except which revolt from the Koran unto another law the Jew by the law of Moses christian by the law of the gospel and the saracen by the law of Mahomet and they hold that at the day of judgement all shall appear under three banner the jew under the banner of Moses and christian under the banner of Christ and turk and other mahometan under Mahomet banner and under their conduct enter into paradise which they describe after a earthly sensual and brutish manner affirm Mahomet paradise that the ground of paradise be of gold which be distinguish with precious stone and sweet flower set thick together plant with all fruitful tree the pleasant river run through the green field whereof some power out milk other white honey other the pure wine and that there they shall be clothe with all sort of colour except black and therefore the turk to this day wear no black but when they see a man clothe in black many of they will go back and say they will fly from he who shall never enter into paradise yet whosoever will live in quiet among they must a note for traveller neither meddle with their law their woman nor their slave Mahomet come to judgement be expect 20. year since for their belief be that Mahomet will come again at the end of 1000 year as he promise they and bring they to paradise which time expire and he not come they have deal more favourable with he and give he long time for they say he be extreme sick when he be ask of the time of his come and that he answer they with such a low voice that he can not well be understand and that they which report that he will return at the end of 1000 year mistake he for that he mean 2000 year at which time if he do not come according to promise they will look for he no long nor belacute eve in he any more but become christian the moor be more ancient dweller in Aleppo than turk and more forward and zealous in mahometism than turk yea all the churchman among the turk be moor who the turk count a base people in regard of themselves and call they tot yet their churchman they have in great reverence and not only they but they reverence churchman of all nation and call they holy man saint and man of God I myself have have great experience hereof both in the place of my abode at Aleppo and in my journey towards jerusalem and in other place in Aleppo as I have walk in the street both turk and moor and other nation will very reverent salute i after the manner of their country yea their very soldier as I have walk in the field with many other of our nation without a jenesarie to guard we though they have be many hundred together yet have they not offer either i or any of my company wrong for my sake but have say one to another Hadah cassy that be this be a churchman and therefore take heed what you do unto he for he be a good man etc. at jerusalem many stranger of sundry nation understand that I be a english preacher come and kiss my hand and call i the english patriarch yea in all my ten year travel I never receive neither be offer wrong by any nation but my own countryman and by they chief who it chief concern to protect i from wrong yet have I find they most forward to offer i wrong only for do my duty and follow the order of our church of England know that I have none of the reverend father of our church to defend i so will it be in England if we have not the reverend father in God the lord bishop of our church to protect we all other nation both heathen and Christian go before we herein in reverence and provide for their churchman the turk honour their mufti which be their chief ruler in ecclesiastical matter next under the grand signior as a angel the nostrane greek armenian Chelfalines and christian of all other nation perform double honour unto they only in England where there be a more learned ministry I speak by experience than in any nation in the world they be least of all regard which make our adversary the papist say as I have hear some of they speak in my hear many thousand mile from England that if we ourselves be persuade of the truth of our religion we will reverence our churchman as they do and not scorn they and contemn they as we do they also account fool dumb man and mad man santones that be saint and whatsoever such mad man say or do though they take any thing out of their house or strike they and wound they yet they take it in good part and say that they shall have good luck after it and when such mad man die they canonize they for saint and erect stately monument over their grave as we have here many example especial of one who be mad go always naked who name be sheh Boubac sheh Boubac at who death they bestow great cost on his funeral and erect a house over his grave where to this day there be lamp burn night and day and many idle fellow who they call daruise there maintain to look unto his sepulchre and to receive the offering of such as come to offer to sheh Boubac which they take to themselves and there be no week but many come out of the city of Aleppo and other place to offer for this sepulchre be build on a hill three mile from Aleppo between the king garden and the fountain of fish if any be sick or in danger they vow that if they recover or escape they will offer so much money or this or that good thing to Sneh Boubac there be also such another bedlam saint in Aleppo yet live sheh Mahammet a naked Santone who they call sheh mahammet a Santone who go always naked with a spit on his shoulder and as he go through the street the shop-keepers will offer he their ring and if he thrust his spit through their ring they take it for a favour and sign of good success the like account they make if he take any thing from their shop board or they or any of their house yea they be yet more mad upon this mad man than so for both man and woman will come unto he and kiss his hand or any other part sometime his thigh and ask he counsel for they hold that mad man soul be in heaven talk with God and that he reveal secret unto they in regard whereof the pasha themselves oftentimes and chief captain will come unto he with some present and kiss some part of his naked body and ask he whether they shall go to battle or not and what success they shall have in war and look whatsoever he say they hold it for a oracle not long since the turk have a victory against the christian and at their return they report that this naked Santone sheh mahammet of Aleppo be see naked in the field fight against their enemy and that by his help they overcome they although he be not near they by many thousand mile whereby you may see how the devil do delude they still as he do their forefather at the first by Mahomet machiaucilian device their daruise also they have in such reputation daruise that often time great pasha when they be in dissauour with the king and fear either loss of life or good or both to avoid danger will turn daruise and then they account themselves privilege person from the rigour of their Law the witness of a daruise or of a churchman will pass better than any man witness beside yea better than Shereffes who they account of Mahomet kindred and they be know from other by their green sash which no man else may wear for green they account Mahomet colour and if they seeany Christian wear a garment of that colour they will cut it from his back and beat he and ask he how he dare presume to wear Mahomet colour and whether he be kine to God or not this I have know put in practice upon christian not acquaint with the custom of the country since my come one for have but green shooestring have his shoe take away another wear green breech under his gown be espy have his breech cut off and he revile and beat we of more knowledge come far behind they in reverence the preacher of the truth and provide for they and it be to be fear that they shall rise up at the day of judgement and condemn we herein the turk have no print among they but all their law and their religion be write in the morisco tongue that be the arabic tongue and he be account a learned man among they that can write and read and as for the latin tongue he be a rare man among they that can speak it some few among they have the italian tongue and many especial in and about Constantinople speak the vulgar greek that be tongue for in Constantinople there be as many grecian and Hebrew as turk the poor among the moor and turk at Aleppo beg oftentimes Syntana in the street in the name and for the sake of Syntana who be as they say a whore of charity and will prostitue herself to any man Bacshese as they say in the arabic tongue that be gratis free the diet of the turk be not very sumptuous diet of the turk Pilawe for the most common dish be Pilaw which be good savoury meat make of rise and small morsel of mutton boil therein and sometime roast buckone that be small bit or morsel of flesh their more costly fare be sambouse and muclebite sambouse be make of paste like a great round pastry with variety of herb and meat therein not mince but in buckone a muclebite be a dish make of egg and herb their small sambouse be more common not so big as a man hand like a square pastry with minsed meat therein they have also variety of Helloway that be sweet meat compound in such sort as be not to be see elsewhere the poor sort feed on herb and fruit of the tree Coffa their most common drink be Coffa which be a black kind of drink make of a kind of pulse like pease call Coava which be ground in the mill and boil in water they drink it as hot as they can suffer it which they find to agree very well with they against their crudity and feed on herb and rawemeate other compound drink they have call Sherbet make of water and sugar or honey with snow therein to make it cool for although the country be hot yet they keep snow all the year long to cool their drink it be account a great courtesy among they to give unto their friend when they come to visit they a fin-ion or Scudella of Coffa which be more wholesome than toothsome for it cause good concoction and drive away drowsiness some of they will also drink Bersh or opium which make they forget themselves and talk idle of castle in the air as though they see vision and hear revelation their Coffa house be more common than alehouse in England but they use not so much to sit in the house as on bench on both side the street near unto a Coffa house every man with his fin-ion full which be smoke hot they use to put it to their nose and ear and then sup it off by leisure be full of idle and alehouse talk while they be among themselves drink of it if there be any news it be talk of there they have also excellent good fountain water in most place of that country which be a common drink among they especial in summer time and in their travel at all time of the year some of our merchant have weigh their water and we in England when they have come home and have find their water light than we by four ounce in the pound and the light the water be the more pleasant it be to drink and go down more delectable as if it be milk rather than water in great city where the fountain be either far off or not so plentiful there be certain poor man which go about the street from morning to night with a bear skin full of water sow up and fasten about his stoulder like a tinker budget with a bowl of brass in his hand and offer water free to they that pass by except they give they any thing in courtesy some seldom time the great part of they be very courteous people among salutation of the turk themselves salute one another at their meetingwith their hand on their breast for they never uncover their head with these word Salam alike Sultanum that be peace be unto you Sir whereunto the other reply Salam that be peace be to you also and sometime thus Elph Marhabba or in turkish thus hosh Geldanos sophi Geldanos that be welcome my dear friend and in the morning subalky Sultanum that be good morrow sir and in the evening thus misalker Sultanum that be good even Sir and when friend and acquaintance meet who have not see one another many day before they salute one another in turkish thus neder halen that be how do you in arabic thus that be how do you sir and ish babtac that be how do thy gate mean all within his gate and so proceed by particular to ask how do thy child slave horse cat dog ass etc. and every thing in the house except his wife for that be hold a very unkind question and not usual among they and if a man come to their house and at the door inquire of the child for their father they will answer he but if he inquire for the mother they will throw stone at he and revile he their woman as have be show before have little liberty to come abroad except it be on the eve before their sabbath which be Thursday to weep at the grave of the dead or to the bannio or hot bath to wash themselves as the use of the country be and when they come abroad they be always mask for it be account a shame for a woman to be see barefaced yea they be so jealous and suspicious over they that father will not suffer their own son after they come to year of age to see their mother these be their common salutation one to another their more special salutation to great personage be these when a man come to salute the great Turk or grand signior himself into who presence few be admit except ambassador and great personage they be lead between two by the arm for fear of a stab by which mean one of their grand signior be once kill and when they return they go backward for it be account a disgrace to turn their backpart to a great man in like manner they salute their pasha and other great man but not lead by the arm but with their hand on the breast bow down their head to kiss the skirt of his garment pronounce these word Ollah towal omrac that be God prolong your day Sir and so long as they talk with a bashaw they stand with their hand on their breast maiden-like and bow low at their departure and go backward they never uncover their head unto any man no not to the king himself yea it be a word of reproach among they to say when they mislike a matter I have as live thou show i thy bare head they call one another diverse and not always by their name but sometime by their father call trade or degree as eben sultan that be the son of a king eben Terzi the son of a tailor and sometime by their father quality as eben Sacran that be the son of a drunkard and sometime by their mark as Colac that be a man without ear Sepher that be Sepher with the thin beard and sometime by their stature as towill that be a tall man sgire rugiall that be a little man and sometime by their office as i-asgee that be a secretary nibe that be a clerk etc. and sometime by their humour as Chiplac that be a naked man or one who be of a humour to wear no clothes but breech but their common word of courtesy either to stranger or such who name they know not or who they purpose to reverence be Chillabee that be gentleman and there be no man among they of any degree will refuse to answer to any of these name but if nature have mark they either with goggle eye bunch back lame leg or any other infirmity or deformity as they be know by it so they be content to be call by it but they that have go on pilgrimage to their holy city Mecha where their prophet Mahomet be bury at their return be call hogy that be pilgrim as hogie Tahar Hogie Mahammet etc. which be count a word of great grace and credit among they and the witness of a hogie will be take before any other of the arabian tthere be also many arabian in Aleppo call vulgar arab or bedween they call themselves saracen of Sara but they be rather Ishmalites of ishmael Abraham son by Hagar and therefore also call Hagarens but some take they to be of the race of the sabaean which be wild and savage people of Sabaea a country in the middle of Arabia towards the east environ with great rock where be great store of cynnomon and Casia frankincense and myrrh which people come of sheba nephew to Ketura and Abraham their native country be Arabia a country in Asia between judaea and Egypt so call of Arabus the son of Apollo it be divide into three region which be these Arabia Petrea Arabia and Arabia foelix but at this day they have no certain country or place of abode but wander up and down throughout all Syria Assyria galle judaea Palestina and Egypt and as in job tune they live by theft and robbery and spoil of man so do they also to this present day they have two king at this day viz. Dandan and Aborisha the one their lawful king the other a usurper and some follow the one and some the other and be bitter enemy one to another yet have I seldom hear of any great war betwixt they for they seldom meet they never come into any wall town or city for fear of treason but live in tent and be here to day and many hundred mile off within few day after they be a base beggarly and rogish people wander up and down and live by spoil which they account no sin because they be Mahomet countryman and he allow they liberty to live by theft yet their king do no great harm but take toll or tribute of the caravans as they pass by which if they pay willing they pass quiet and be not rob but a little exact upon one of their king have often time pitch his tent near unto the city of Aleppo and many merchant be desirous to see they and their order take occasion to present he with some small present or other which he take very kind and admit they to his table and give they a tent to lodge in all night on the morrow for breakfast one of they make he a minsed pie and set it before he hot as it come out of the oven but as Diogenes accustom to feed on root have a piece of a tart give he to eat and as he be eat it be ask what it be answer that it be bread and when he be laugh at for his answer he say again either it be bread of a very good make or bread very well handle in the bake so this synicall or diogenical king accustom to feed gross have never see a pie or pastry before marvel what it be and when he see it cut up and open and perceive smoke to out of it shrink back fear it have be some engine to destroy he and that the fire will follow after the smoke but when he perceive no fire follow the smoke he be content to taste of it and high commend it as the dainty dish that ever he taste of in his life these arabian king never keep any money in their purse but spend it as fast as they find it and when they want with their sword they seek a new purchase some be soldier fight faithful on any side that will give they pay some of this rogish arabian race follow neither of their king but wander from place to place in cave and rock and live by their sword not only rob but kill such as they can overcome other of they of a better mind sojourn in city of trade and traffic and make themselves servant to any nation that will set they on work and well reward they some of they be horsekeeper some bastage that be porter and some under-cooke in kitchen and be very serviceable but for the most part their lodging be on some dunghill or other or odd corner of the city with some silly tent over their head their wife wear ring in their nose either of silver or brass fasten to the middle gristle of their nose and colour their lip blow with indigo and go always bare legged and (@) with (@) or ring of brass aboe their ankle and bracelet of brass abou^ their hand they be people which can and do (@) go at (@) and misery both for diet and lodging their woman be skilful in mourn and cry by art and therefore they be hire to cry at the funeral of turk and moor oftentimes tear their hair and make all their face blow with indigo the chief thing that I have observe in they worth praise be this that they retain the use of speak their natural tongue to this day speak the arabic natural which be a far more learned language than the turkish for as the turk religion be a mix religion compound of many religion so be their language also a medley language or as I may just call it a link wolfie religion and language compound of many other language wherein nothing be write but the arabian tongue be a learned language wherein Aui^en and many learned physician have write much and to this day the turk Alcoran and all their law and religion be write in the arabic tongue which be one of those oriental language which depend on the Hebrew tongue wherein because you have some knowledge and be studious in the tongue according to your request in your last letter I will acquaint you what language be here speak and which language be most common and commendable to traveller to go further withal there be here speak so many several language as there be several nation here dwell or sojourn every nation among themselves speak their own language and here be of most nation in the world some who either come with their merchandise to sell or by commodity or sojourn here as stranger or else have access and recess to this city as traveller but of all christian language the italian tongue be most use and therewithal a man may travel further but of all the orientoll tongue these four be most speak in these part arabic turkish armenian and persian or Agimesco of every one of which language that you may see how they differ I will show you how they number from one to twenty to satisfy your expectation the manner of number in four oriental tongue of the jew beside all these mahometan which I have already name there be many jew in Constantinople Aleppo Damascus Babylon Cayro and every great city and place of merchandise throughout all the turk dominion who be know by their hat for they be accustom to wear red hat without broom at my first come but late the head vizier be their enemy they be constrain to wear hat of blue cloth because red be account too stately and princelike a colour for they to wear they be call by three name which be give to they of old first they be call hebrew as some suppose of Heber the four from Noah in who the Hebrew tongue remain at the confusion of tongue whence he have his name but s. Augustine and other father affirm that they be first call hebreweof Abraham with the alteration of a few letter Hebraei Abrahaei that be hebrew as it be Abrahites second they be call israelite from Jacob surname Israel who grandfather Abraham be three they be call jew after that Juda and Benjamin which for the unity of mind be as it be one tribe follow rehoboam the son of Solomon of the tribe of juda make the kingdom of juda the other ten betake they to of the tribe of Ephraim set up the kingdom of the ephramite or Israel and what become of those ten tribe the jew acknowledge themselves to be ignorant only some of their rabbi think they to be in Tarracia the only reason which I have hear they allege for their opinion be this because they often understand by tartarian who come from thence to use merchandise in Aleppo and else where that there be many among they call by hebrew name to this day of these three name whereby they be know the most common name whereby they be call at this day be the name of jew one and the same people thrice change their name and often the place of their abode and to this day they have no king nor country proper to themselves but be disperse throughout the whole world and in every place where they come they be contemptible and of base account matth. 27. 25. according to the cry of those crucifier his blood be upon we and our child which be fulfil this day in our ear and eye they be of more vile account in the sight of turk than christian in so much that if a Jew will turn Turk he must first turn Christian before they will admit he to be a Turk yea it be a word of reproach among the turk and a usual protestation among they when they be false accuse of any crime to clear themselves they use to protest in this manner if this be true then God grant I may die a Jew and the jew in like case use to say if this be not a false accusation than God grant I may die a Christian pray better for themselves then they believe and as all of they must be that shall be save and the poor christian sojourn and dwell in these part do hate they very uncharitable and irreligious in that we read rom. 11. many argument prove that they shall be convert again for on good Friday in many place especial at zante they throw stone at they insomuch that they dare not come out of their house all that day and yet be scarce in safety in their house for they use to throw stone at their window and door and on the roof of their house on thrusday about noon the jew begin to keep within door and continue there with their door shut until Saturday about noon for if they come forth before that time they be sure to be stone but after noon on easter eve if they come abroad they may pass as quiet as ever they do these in their blind zeal think to be revenge on they for who Christ pray say father forgive they for they know not what they do and some ignorant christian refuse to eat of their meat or bread their reason be because the jew refuse to eat or drink with christian to this day or to eat any meat that christian kill but it be not unusual among christian of better knowledge to eat of the jew meat which ordinary they buy of they for the jew to this day eat not of the hinderpart of any beast but only of the former part and sell the hinder quarter of their beef mutton kid goat etc. to christian they observe still all their old ceremony and feast sacrifice only except which the turk will not suffer they to do for they be wont among they to sacrifice child but dare not now for fear of the turk yet some of they have confess that their physician kill some christian patient or other who they have under their hand at that time in stead of a sacrifice if a man die without child the next brother take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother and they still marry in their own kindred many of they be rich merchant some of they drogomen and some broker most of they be very crafty and deceitful people they have no beggar among they but many thief and some who steal for necessity because they dare not beg they be also very great usurer and therein the turk ecell they for although there be usurer among they yet they allow it not for if a christian or any man borrow money of a Turk though he promise he interest yet if he pay the principal he dare not molest he for interest nor complain of he be against their law the jew sabbath be on Saturday which they observe so strict that they will not travel upon any occasion on that day nor receive money nor handle a pen to write as I have know by experience in a doctor of physic but on the morrow he will take double fee of his patient they read their law in the Hebrew tongue write in phylactery or long roll of parchment and the old testament be also read in the Hebrew but their cakam and cohens preach in the spanish tongue all matter of controversy betwixt themselves be bring before their Cakam to decide who be their chief churchman Cakam in Hebrew be as much as in latin that be a wise man and cohen in Hebrew be as much as Sacerdos in latin that be a priest most of the jew can read Hebrew but few of they speak it except it be in two place in Turkey and that be at Salonica former call thessalonica a city in Macedonia by the gulf thermaicus and at Safetta in the holy land near unto the sea of Galilee which two place be as it be vwersity or school of learning among they and there grati^ they speak Hebrew I have sundry time have conference with many of they and some of they yea the great part of they be blasphemous wretch who when they be press with a argument which they can answer break out into opprobrious speech and say Christ be a false prophet and that his disciple steal he out of his grave while the soldier who watch he sleep and that their forefather do deserve crucify he and that if he be now live they will use he worse than ever then forefather do of christian of sundry sort sojourn in Aleppo beside these turk moor and arabian which be all mahometan and jew which be talmudist there be also sundry sort of christian in this country which be of two sort either such as be bear bring up and dwell in the country or such as be bear in Christendom and only sojourn here for a time to exercise merchandise the first sort who be bear in this heathen country and dwell there be either armenian maronites jacobite georgian Chelfalines or greek which be all govern by their patriarch for ecclesiastical matter but for civil government both they and their patriarch be subject to turkish law yea they be all slave unto the great Turk who they call their grand signior of the nostrane or nazaritan among all these sort of christian there be among the M^ronites a ancient company of christian call vulgar nostrane nazaritan of the sect of the nazarite more civil and harmless people than any of the rest their country be mount Lybanus as I write unto you heretofore but many of they dwell at Aleppo whereof some of they be cassise that be churchman some of they be cook and servant unto english merchant and other some artificer all of they live somewhat poor but they be more honest and true in their conversation than any of the rest especial at their first come from mount Lybanus to dwell in Aleppo and many during their continuance there if they be not corrupt by other wicked nation there dwell in who I observe more by experience than I hear of they or note in they when I be among they at mount Lybanus and especial for the manner of their marriage and how they honour the same they buy their wife of their father as other there dwell do but never see they until they come to be marry nor then neither until the marriage be solemnize betwixt they for there be a partition in the place where they meet to be marry and the man and his friend stand on the one side and the young woman and her friend on the other side where they may hear but not see one another until the cassy bid the young man put his hand through a hole in the wall and take his wife by the hand and while they have hand in hand the mother of the maid come with some sharp instrument make for the purpose and all to beprick the new marry man hand and make it bleed and if he let her hand go when he feel his hand smart they hold it for a sign that he will not love she but if he hold fast notwithstanding the smart and wring she hard by the hand until she cry rather than he will once shrink than he be count a love man and her friend be glad that they have bestow she on he and how they honour marriage above other I observe by the name of their first man-child for as among we the woman when they be marry lose their surname and be surname by the husband surname and child likewise so among they the father lose his name and be call by the name of his elder son in this manner I have know a nostrane who name be mou-se that be Moses who have a man-child name he Vseph that be joseph and then be the father no more call mou^e mo^es but above Vseph that be the father of joseph another who name be Vseph name his elder son pher-iolla after which he be no more call V^eph but above ph^r-iolla the father of pher-iolla another man call jubraell that be Gabriel his son at the time of baptism be name mouse he always after be call above mouse that be the father of Moses such a honour do they account it to be father of a man-child these nostrane reverence their cassise great and kiss their hand wheresoever they meet they yet be most of they altogether unlearned have only the knowledge of the syriac tongue wherein their liturgy be read they keep their feast at the same time as we do viz. Christmas Easter and Whitsuntide and at Christmas on the twelve day in the morning call epiphany their young man have a custom betimes in the morning to leap naked into the water I can never hear any reason of their so do but Vzansa de press the custom of their country and though it be then very cold yet they persuade themselves and other that then it be hot than at any other time and that the water than have a extraordinary virtue to wash away their sin on Monday in Easter week and Whitsun week these nostrane go with their cassise to the grave of the dead and there kneel down and burn incense and pray at every grave of the chelfalines the chelfalines be christian dwell upon the border of Persia between Mesopotamia and Persia at a place call these bring silk to Aleppo to sell they be plai^^ deal people if a man pay they money and by over-reckoning himself give they more than their due though there be but one piece over so soon as they perceive it though it be many day after they will bring it back again and restore it and think they shall never return safe into their country if they shall not make restitution thereof these people persuade themselves and report unto other that they dwell in that place which be call Eden whereinto Adam be put to keep it and dress it but some hold that this pleasant garden Eden do extend over all the earth but by the second chapter of genesis it appear manifest that this garden wherein man be place which we call paradise be a certain place on earth not spread over all but only a part thereof contain a convenient portion of the country call Eden bound upon the river Euphrates which river be divide into four stream and run or at leastwise do then flow in manner as it be describe gen. 2. 10. etc. and Eden be the name of a country so call for the pleasantness of it for Hadan in Hebrew be in english to delight from hence also the greek call pleasure (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) and howsoever it besomewhat probable that these chelphalines dwell now in that country which be call Eden yet Plato and Aristo^le and Lactantius and other do constant affirm as they have receive of ancient monument that mountain and river and land and country have receive much alteration in this kind Sicilia be say to have be divide from Italy Cyprus from Syria England from France by the violence of the sea whereas before they be join as Pelo^onne^us be to the rest of Grecia or as the town of rye at a high water seem to be to the rest of England so that no certainty can be give either by read or travel of the place where Eden be because these river run in other stream forasmuch as Cyrus at the take of Babylon be affirm to have restrain the main channel of this very river Euphrates unto a unwonted course and to have divide the river ginde which be next unto it in greatness into 360. stream beside the country of Mesopotamia by which these river pass be partly dry and sandy and seldom water with the shower of heaven and on the other part exceed fruitful by the nature of the soil be by the industry of the inhabitant so nourish with water by cut out channel and ditch out of the main stream as the same be amend where it be barren of the same unfruitfulness and correct again of his overrich increase where it be over fertile no marvel therefore if these river be not full agree upon by writer have lose perhaps their ancient stream together with their name as paradise and the whole earth beside have lose her ancient fruitfulness and these Chelphalines be ignorant people and have no reason to prove that they now dwell in the place which be call Eden whereinto Adam be put to keep it and to dress it but that the river Euphrates and other river mention gen. 2. 10. 11. 12. run by their country other of they say that they have receive it by tradition from their elder from time to time but that which God have conceal I will not search out but notwithstanding all that I have read hear or see in my travel I resolve myself that no man live can demonstrate the place which God for the sin of Adam accurse and ever since the place be unknown of the greek the greek be a very superstitious subtle and deceitful people insomuch that it be grow to a proverb among the italian in Grego intrego that be he that trust to a greek shall be int^eaged and still to seek they hate the papist and yet in many thing agree with they as in auricular confession transubstantiation and some other opinion but their liturgy be read in the vulgar tongue the greek in Aleppo be very poor for they be there for the most p^rt but broker or bastage that be porter and many of their woman as light as water maintain their husband themselves and their family by prostitute their body to other and their own husband be often time their pander or procurer to bring they customer but the greek that live at Constantinople be many of they great merchant and very rich but exceed proud and sumptuous in apparel even the base of they and especial their woman who though they be but cobbler wife or poor artificer wife yet they go in gown of satin and taffery yea of cloth of silver and gold adorn with precious stone and many gem and jewel about their neck and hand they care not how they pinch their belly so that they may have fine apparel on their back and at the time of their marriage the woman condition with their husband to find they decent apparel and convenient diet and bring they before their patriarch of Constantinople to confirm it which if it be not perform according if they complain to their patriarch they be divorce present and she take a other man to her husband better able to maintain she and he may marry a other woman if he please one only instance hereof will I give you in a matter notorious know to all nation sojourn or dwell in or about Constantinople in pera or Gallata on the other the water there be a most famous or rather infamous greek whore call Charatza Sophia that be mistress Sophia the daughter of a poor greek widow who live by laundry who be marry u^to a geeke because he keep she not fine enough she complane of he to the patriarch and be divorce from he and present thereupon take another man who be a christian in name but no greek but one who be as be report of he bear in no land in the world but by sea and bring up in Polonia until he be thirteen or fourteen neere of age and then come to Constantinople and serve many master there at the first in the base service both in the stable and in the kitchen and afterward in better service than he deserve be both unlearned and irreligious this man have many child by this infamous woman Sophia yet after many year arise to high fortune turn she away and marry another woman and to daub up the matter somewhat smooth procure a greek tailor to marry with this Sophia and give many hundred doler with she to her marriage but this Charatza can not content herself long with this greek tailor but admit daily other man into her company whereupon the poor tailor run away with his money and leave this light housewife to the mercy of her former lover have three husband live yet she herself live with none of they this be common in every man mouth thereabouts and talk of many thousand mile off to the disgrace of his country and slander of Christianity and both at Constantinople Aleppo and other place of Turkey where there be traffike and trade of merchant it be no rare matter for popish christian of sundry other country to cut cabin as they call it that be to take any woman of that country where they sojourn Turkish woman only except for it be death for a Christian to meddle with they and when they have buy they and enroll they in the cadies book to use they as wife so long as they sojourn in that country and maintain they gallant to the consume of their wealth diminish of their health and endanger of their own soul and when they depart out of that country they shake off these their sweet-heart and leave they to shift for themselves and their child and this they account no sin or at least wise such a sin as may be wash away with a little holy water and these be the virtue which many christian learn by sojourn long in heathen country which be not to be marvel at for if joseph a good man live in Pharaoh his court have learned to swear by the life of Pharaoh and Peter a great apostle be in the high priest hall but once deny Christ thrice we may well think that they which dwell long in wicked country and converse with wicked man be somewhat taint with their sin if not altogether sour with the leaven of their ungodliness of those who they call frank or freemen sojourn in Aleppo the other sort of christian live in Aleppo be such as be bear in other part of Christendom and only sojourn there for a time to use traffic and trade in merchandise and these be englishman italian frenchman dutchman and other who they call by a general name that be frank or freeman for all the rest even from the great bashaw or vizier unto the poor peasant be slave unto the grand signior who only be free and all the ^est be bear bring up live and die his slave for the grand signior can command the head of any one of they at his pleasure yea if some great vizier or Bashawe to who he have commit the government of some city or country fall into he disfavour if he send but a cappagie that be a Pur^e^an^ to he with his writing with a black seal in a black box none of they all dare withstand he but suffer this base c^^ppagie to strangle he though it be in the house before his wife child and servant yet none dare lift up their hand against he there be a Bashawe of Aleppo who govern the city and country adjoin who be in the disfavour of the king and the king send a cappagie to strangle he who inquire for the bashaw house at A^eppo and understand he be at his garden four mile from the city he ride and meet he in the way and open his black box and show he his commission to strangle he whereat his countenance change and he only crave this favour that he may have liberty to say his prayer before he die which perform he yield his head and be strangle sit on his horse before all his follower which be at the least 100l man and no man dare speak one word against it much less offer to resist he but say it be god will it shall be so and not only the great Turk do thus tyrannize over his slave but every bashaw who have government over other in a city or country tyrannize over those which be under their regiment and sometime strangle sometime behead and sometine put unto terrible torture those who offend yea oftentimes without offence only because they be rich and have fair house the bashaw will lay to their charge such thing as he himself know to be untrue and put they to death that he may seize upon his good there be a sheriff or a green-headin Aleppo who they account Mahomet kindred who offend the bashaw and brave he in term as though he dare not punish he he cause one of his officer to go with he home and when he come before his own door open in the street to break both his leg and arm and there let he lie and no man dare find fault or give he food or physician or chirurgeon come to he or wife or servant take he into house but there he lie all day and shall so have continue until he have die for hunger or dog eat he have not his friend give money to the bashaw to have his throat cut to rid he out of his pain and this be a common punishment among they and sometime for small offence they will lay a man down on his back and hoist up his foot and with a cudgel give they 300. or 400. blow on the sole of their foot whereby many be lame and some they set on a sharp stake naked which come from his fundament up to his mouth if he find not favour to have his throat cut soon and some be ganch in this manner they be draw up by a rope fasten about their arm to the top of a gazouke or gibbet full of hook and let downward again and on what part soever any hook take hold by that they hang until they die for hunger and some in like sort be draw over a gibbet and they be compass about the naked waste with a small cord the cord be draw by 2. man to make they draw up their breath and still pull straight and strait until they be so narrow in the waste that they may easy be cut off by the middle at one blow and then the upper part be let down on a hot gridiron and there sear up to keep they in sense and feel of pain so long as be possible and the neither part be throw to the dog etc. unspeakable be their tyranny to those that fall into their hand not unlike the tyranny of the spaniard towards the poor indian who never offend they they who they call frank or freeman live in great security among they than their own people by reason that they be govern by consul of their own nation and those consul also be back by ambassador for the same nation which be always Leige^s at Constantinople and when their consul abroad be offer wrong they write unto the ambassador how and by who they be wrong and then the ambassador procure from the great Turk commandment to the bashaw of Aleppo to redress their wrong and punish such as offend they otherwise there be no dwell for frank among they but they shall be use like slave by every slave and notwithstanding their consul and ambassador too yet they be oftentimes abuse by turk both in word and deed in word they revile they as the egyptian do the israelite and call they gour that be infidel and Cupec that be dog and Canzier that be hog and by many other odious and reproachful name and though they strike they yet dare they not strike again lest they lose their hand or be worse use they also oftentimes make Auenias of they that be false accusation and suborn false witness to confirm it to be true and no christian word will be take against a Turk for they account we infidel and call themselves musselman that be true believer this misery abroad will make b love our own country the better when we come thither and that be the best lesson which I have learn in my travel that be the contempt of the world and s. Paul lesson phil. 4. 11. in whatsoever state I be therewith to be content oh how happy be you in England if you know your own happiness but as the prodigal son until he be pinch with penury abroad never consider the plenty of his father house so many in England know not their own felicity because they do not know the misery of other but if they be here in this heathen country they will know what it be to live in a christian common wealth under the government of a godly king who rule by law and not by lust where there be plenty and peace and preach of the gospel and many other godly blessing which other want and God long continue his mercy to our noble king james and his whole realm and give we grace as far to excel other nation in thankfulness as we do in happiness and thus for present I commend you to the most gracious protection of the almighty Jehovah beseech he if it be his will to send we a joyful meeting both in this world and in the world to come amen (@) (@) (@) (@)

superstitious devotion to see relic or worship such place as they account holy but as traveller and merchant occasion by dearth and sickness pestilence and famine in the city where we sojourn which two be such followlike companion that the grecian distinguish they but by one letter call the pestilence (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) and the famine (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) by reason whereof all traffic be hinder and those merchant who they call Frankes or freemen either remove to other place or such as stay in the city cause their gate to be shut up and come not abroad until Sol enter into Leo which be usual the twelve or thirteen day of july at which time the plague still cease in this place though it be never so great and all that be then sick amend and such as then come abroad need not fear any danger the turk moor arabian and other mahometan never remove for fear of any sickness nor refuse any man company infect therewith for they say every man fortune be write in his forehead and that they shall not die before their time not know what it be to tempt God and to refuse ordinary mean but in this interim from the begin of this sickness which be in march until the expect and undoubted end when the sun enter into Leo we who name be subscribe for cause above mention take our voyage from Aleppo towards jerusalem have letter of commendation from the Venice consul and sundry other of the chief italian merchant to their Padres at jerusalem for our kind usage there with liberty of conscience dom. 1600. march 9 after dinner we set forth guard with jenesary and accompany with sundry english italian and french merchant who in kindness ride with we seven or eight mile to bring we on the way and then return to Aleppo but most of our english merchant bring we to cane toman cane toman ten mile from Aleppo where we make merry with such good cheer as we bring with we for there be nothing to be have for money but goat milk whereof we have as much as we will here we purpose to have sleep all night but have no other bed but the hard ground with Jacob pillow a good hard stone under our head unaccustomed to such down bed we can not sleep but spend the time in honest mirth until it be past midnight and then our friend take their leave of we and return towards Aleppo and we proceed in our journey towards jerusalem the night be dark and the way dangerous and thievish our jenesarie byram bashaw will we every one to take a match light in our hand and to whirl it about that the fire may be see the further to terrify the thief lest they shall surprise we on the sudden and when we come to suspicious place as cave rock barn or odd cottage in the way our jenesarie use to ride before and as fowler beat upon bush for bird so he with his lance will strike and beat upon such place lest wild arab which lie lurk in such place shall steal upon we on the sudden when the day appear saracoope our way be pleasant and comfortable unto we until we come to a village call saracoope whither we come about noon March 10. and because our seisenar or sumptor horse which carry provision for man and horse as the custom of the country be be tire and we ourselves also for want of sleep the night pass weary and hungry we be constrain to lodge there all night on the hard ground by our horse heel in a old cane distant from cane toman 28. mile March 11. betimes in the morning we depart from Saracoop and come betimes in the afternoon to a fine village call Marrah Marrah where there be a very fair new cane build by amrath common call Morat Chillabee sometime Defterdare that be treasurer of Aleppo and afterward of Damascus who for the refuge of traveller and their protection against thief build a stately strong cane like unto Leadenhall in London or rather the exchance in London where there be fair upper room for great man in their travel and the neither room be for ordinary traveller and their horse but in hot wether the best make choice to sleep on the ground in low room rather than in their chamber the founder hereof also ordain that all traveller that way shall have their entertainment there of his cost he allow they bread Pilaw and mutton which our jenesary accept off but we scorn relief from turk without money send unto the village where beside our own provision which we bring with we we have also other good thing for money Marrah be distant from saracoope 24. mile march 12. be a very rainy day yet we travel all the forenoon until we come to a village call lacmine which a far off make show of a very fair village but when we come thither we find it so ruinous that there be not one house able to shroud we from the extremity of the shower the inhabitant thereof have forsake it and flee into the mountain to dwell for fear of the jenesary of Damascus who travel that way use to take from they not only victual for themselves and provender for their horse without money but whatsoever thing else they find in their house only there be a little church or chappel there in good preparation whereinto for a little money we obtain leave to enter ourselves with our horse and carriage and there we bring out our victual and refresh ourselves and bait our horse and rest until it leave rain after the shower while our horse be prepare we walk into the field near unto the church and see many poor people gather Mallas and three leave grass and ask they what they do with it and they answer that it be all their food and that they boil it and do eat it then we take pity on they and give they bread which they receive very joyful and bless God that there be bread in the world and say they have not see any bread the space of many month we also give unto they small piece of silver to relieve their necessity which they receive grateful and wish that their country be in the hand of christian again the shower cease we ride from this chapel and village of lack money I shall have say lacmin but may say lack man and money too and ride forward until we come unto a village or town call Tyaba where because it be near night we desire to lodge but can not be admit into any house for any money whereupon our chief jenesarie byram B^shaw go into a house and offer to pull man woman and child out of the house that we may bring in our horse and lodge there ourselves but when we see what pitiful lamentation they make we entreat our jenesarie either to persuade they for money or to let they alone and understand that there w^s a fair city in our way ten mile off we five with our jenesarie be well horse ride thither and leave our carriage with the rest of our company at Tyaba to come to we betimes in the morning this city be now common call aman but of old it be call H^mat^ 2. king 17. here we lodge in a fair cane but on the cold ground and upon the hard stone and think ourselves well provide for that we have a house over our head to keep we day here we meet with victual for money and provender for our horse on the morrow the rest of our company come unto we from Tyaba and one of our horse be lame we stay there all that day to buy another and meet there that day another swagger jenesarie of Damascus of our old acquaintance at Aleppo call Mahomet bashaw who come from jerusalem with italian merchant who he have guard thither these give we good direction for our voyage and tell we what danger they have escape Hamath be from Marrah about five and thirty mile on the fourteen of march we travel from Hamath hemse a pleasant way and a short day journey to a fine town call vulgar Hems^ but former Hus distant from Hamath but twenty mile this be say to have be the city where job dwell and be to this day call by the christian (@) bite in those border job city and there be a fruitful valley near unto it call the u^lley of H^s and a castle not f^rre off in the way to ^^^poly H^s call Hu^ castle to this day but I make some doubt whether job be ever at this place for job be say to have dwell among the edomite or wicked idumaean and Idumae^ border upon Arabia foelix and not near Syria where this city call Hus stand whence the sabaean come which with violence take away job ox and ass and job be say to come of the posterity of Isaiah and some think he to have be the son of Abram by Ketura yet may this city now call hemse or Hus be the land of one call by name hus for I do find in the genealogy of the holy scripture three man of that name hus one be arams son nephew to Noah gen. 10. 23. a second be nachor Abraham brother son by Milchah gen. 22. 21. the three be of the posterity and kindred of Esau as appear in his genealogy gen. 3^ 28. whence some gather that job be a idumaean of the posterity of Esau but other affirm he to have be the son of Abram by Ketura and not unlikely that some one of these three may have dwell at this place in Syria call Hus which by corruption of time be call hemse on the day of march we go from Hus towards Damascus which be four day journey off and all the way until we come within ten mile of Damascus be a desert uninhabited and a thievish way only there be erect in the way certain cane to lodge in but if they bring not provision with they both for man and horse and some quilt or pillow to sleep on the hard stone must be their bed and the air their supper for some of their cane be nothing but stone wall to keep out thief in city they have very stately cane but not for traveller but for themselves to dwell in for every rich man call his house a cane but the cane that stand in high way be in charity erect by great man for the protection of traveller but most of they be very bad keep and be worse than stable our first day journey from Hus be a very uncomfortable and dangerous desert we see no house all the way until we come unto a village call hassia where we lodge in a old castle distant from Hus 22. Hassia mile march 16. from hassia we ride to a ancient christian town call Charrah cha^rah where our provision be spend we make supply thereof and buy bread and wine of the christian there dwell it be inhabit by greek and turk but govern by turk only there be but one church in the town which be dedicate to s. Nicolas by the christian who first build it but both christian and turk pray therein the christian on the one side or i will of the church and the turk on the other but the christian be over rule by the turk and constrain to find they oil to their lamp in the church for the turk not only burn lamp in their church every night but during the whole time of their lent they beset the battlement of their steeple round about with lamp but when their Lent be end they burn lamp in their steeple only once a week and that be on Thursday at night which be the eve before their sabbath after we have refresh ourselves here half the day be not yet spend we ride from hence to a poor village call Nebecke Nebeck or as they pronounce it Nebhkeh where we lodge in a old cane distant from Hassio 27. mile and understand at this place that the way that we be to pass on the morrow be full of arab and that two day before many man be find in the way kill by they we fear to go any further yet meet with company contrary to expectation march 17. we go forward and see no house nor company all the day long beside ourselves until we come to a village call Cotifey Cotifey where we lodge in a very stately new cane build by Synan bashaw and not altogether finish this cane do far exceed that at Marrah before mention for hereunto be adjoin a fair new church and a Bazar that be a market place where traveller may buy many good thing here be also meat for traveller and provender for their horse to be have of the founder cost and in the middle of this cane there be a fair large fountain of water of hew stone four square wherein there be exceed good water for traveller to drink and chamber for their lodging but if they will have any bed they must bring they with they or sleep on the hard ground as most man that travel that way be wont to do march 18. from Cotifey we have not much more than 20. mile to Dama^cus the first ten mile be a desert and dangerous way and we hardly escape danger for a a^a^ian horseman see we come stand as a spy in our way to view our strength and mark every one of we very narrow and what weapon we have and then ride up a high mountain as fast as if it have be plain ground ^o acquaint his companion what a prey he have find for they whereupon our jenesarie cast aside his upper garment be a gambe^looke and bid we all make ready our weapon and he himself ride before we with his lance on his shoulder expect there come upon we sudden but they have esp^ed from the top of the mountain fifty jenesarie of Dama^cus at the least with their i^mmoglans come after we come not and so by the providence of God we escape their hand the other part of our way to Damascus be a pleasant plain of ten mile in length have many fruitful oillage fine river and pleasant garden thereon at our entrance into this plain or valley ride down a hill we behold the prospect of Damascus ten mile off Damascus whither we come about two of the clock in the afternoon and take up our lodging in the middle of the city at a cane call in Mou^^^co cane Nebbe that be the cane of the prophet but by the turk cane Haramin where we hire three chamber for our money and our servant buy our meat and dress it themselves as they do also all the rest of the way where we can get any thing to this end we take a cook with we and other servant from A^eppo to dress our meat and to look to our horse here we meet with frenchman and other christian stay for company to go to jerus^lem at Damascus many jewish merchant and greek and other know some of we and come to salute we and present we with (@) good thing as they have both wine and bread and (@) ^nd fruit etc. and lend we very good bed with sheet and (@) surmise (...) wellou^ w^^rie^ body march 19 and 20. we stay at Damascus to rest ourselves and see the city of Damascus damascus be a most ancient city and as Isaiah speak of it in his time the head of aram be Damascus isa 7. 8. so Damascus be the chief city of Syria to this day the situation thereof be most pleasant be build on a plain ground strong wall about and a strong castle therein with many fine river run on every side of it especial Abanah and pharpar mention 2. King 5. which now be divide into many head the turk say that their prophet Mahomet be once at Damascus and that when he see the pleasant situation of it and behold the stately prospect of it excel all other that ever he see before refuse to enter into the city lest the pleasantness thereof shall ravish he and move he there to settle a earthly paradise and hinder his desire of the heavenly paradise it have also many pleasant orchard and garden round about the city and some way for the space of a mile and more about the city there be many orchard and great variety of fruit some call Adam apple and Ad^ms fig and sundry other strange fruit Damascus be call by the turk shame and they call it the garden of Turkey because there be no place in all the turk dominion especial in Syria that yield such abundance of fruit here we state two day and three night to rest ourselves and see the city and have a greek to our guide he ^ hew we first a stately Muskia or turkish church erect in the place where the temple of Ry^mon stand mention 2 King 5. and two other memorable matter mention act. 9 25. viz. the place where the disciple let down (@) the night through the wall in a basket whereof the Christ (...) keep a eract memorial take upon the strate the very place of the wall which we (...) bek^ing they confirm it with this reason that Damascus be never overcome and that there have be christian dwell there ever since the time of Paul and therefore may keep a memorial of the very place but to let the place pass the thing itself we know to be true he show we also the house of ananias which be under the ground whereinto we be lead down a pair of stair from the street as it be into a cellar and the door be unlock we enter with candle into the place where we see two dark chamber where a man can see to read in the day time without candle here they say he live in secret for fear of the jew many christian come thither to see that place with a coal write their name on the wall and there be so many name there already that there be scarce room for any other to set his name some of they report Damascus to be build in the place where kain kill his brother Abel and some say it be near it and offer to bring we to the place but we refuse they take upon they also at Damascus to demonstrate the place where s. George be bury so they do likewise at Aleppo but I think the one to be as true as the other there be a fine town near unto Damascus about two or three mile distant on the side of a hill Salhia call Salhia from whence a man may behold the prospect of the city of Damascus most pleasant with the garden and pleasant place about it at Damascus we meet many thousand turk go on pilgrimage towards Mecha in Arabia to visit Mahomet sepulchre as they usual do every year about their byram time for they hold that whosoever once in his life time shall not go on pilgrimage to Mecha to see the sepulchre of their prophet shall never enter into paradise and therefore some of they go thither often in their life time partly for devotion and partly to buy merchandise for there be bring thither at that time of the year great store of commodity from India Persia and other place and none may by or sell there but Mahome^ans and it be forbid to all christian upon pain of death to come near Mecha within five mile partly lest they shall mar their market but chief lest they shall see their folly or rather madness in worship a iron sepulchre after the sight whereof many of their old man which think never to come thither again use to pull out both their eye after they have see so holy a sight as they accout it as their prophet sepulchre and think thereby to inherit heaven tantum that be in such shameful sort themselves to deface their religion move they for want of grace and whosoever say they die in his pilgrimage thither or return from thence be sure to go to heaven present and they that have be there but once be always after call hogy hogy that be pilgrim and be call by that name in this manner if his name before be Mahomet he be at his return call hogie Mahomet if before Mustapha he be always after call hogie Mustapha etc. and they that have be often at Mecha and return again be call great hogy and every year when the caravan of pilgrim return from Mecha he that have be there often be call the great hogie and be great honour of they all for he ride before they all in more stately apparel than they with flower and garland about his horse and when they come near any great city the chief man in the city ride forth to meet he and bring he into the city with great solemnity they false affirm that this their temple at Mecha in Arabia be build by Abraham and they prepare themselves with great care to go to worship there than many christian do when they come to the lord supper for they disburden their heart of all hatred and malice and reconcile themselves one to another etc. otherwise they hold that all their labour be lose and that they shall be never a whit the better for their pilgrimage but if they forgive one another and repent they for their former sin they think there to obtain full remission of all their sin and that at their return they be pure and without spot march 21. we depart from the city of Damascus and about five or six mile from the city pass by a village call Daria Daria near unto which we see a great multitude of man woman and child on their knee in the high way and by that tune they have end their devotion we draw so near as to salute they and ask what they be it be tell we that they be all christian of sundry nation viz. armenian greek chelfalme Nostranes and sundry other who go to jerusalem to visit and worship the holy place there we ask further what they mean to fall on their knee in that place they answer we that it be the place where * * Mucro Sauh pauli Paul be convert and that it be their custom when they travel that way to fall on their knee and pray unto God to convert they they be in number at the least four or five hundred people there be a greek patriarch and a armenian bishop in their company many of they know we have see we in Alepp^ and salute we by our name we ride a while in company together and lodge all together that night at a cane call Sassa Sassa distant from Dama^cus 26. mile march 22. we ride before the rest of the company our way that we travel all this day be exceed bad rocky waterish Arabia Petr^a and barren call Arabia Pet^ea where our horse often time stick fast in the puddle and miry place and sometime ready to break their own leg and their rider neck among rock and stone it be neither pleasant go on foot nor ride this way for there be no path nor even ground but huge stone and rock so near together that our horse can go but a foot pace and often time meet with such marsh and quagmire that we be constrain to go far about before we can find better way to pass over it be also exceed cold in this place always in respect of other place in that country for there be neither tree nor house nor high hill to keep away the violence and force of the wind the caravans that travail usual that way betwixt Damascus and Egypt say that this day journey trouble they more than all the rest and that they never pass by that way but they leave two or three of their camel behind they some misfortune or other befall unto they we see also in sundry place this way the carcase of many dead camel which have miscarry among the rock it be also a very thievish way full of wild arab yet by the providence of God we come safe that day to Conetra where we lodge in a good cane distant from sassa 28. mile after our tedious travel to Conetra find the place pleasant at our come thither we walk about to solace ourselves in behold the green pasture and run river never unto it and in view the order of sundry nation there assemble together from sundry place some come from Egypt and bind to Damascus pitch their tent without the cane near unto the river other come from Damascus and bind to jerusalem accommodate themselves in such sort as they can within the cane but especial in a Bazar like unto a cloister adjoin to the cane we take pleasure to walk up and down some few turn which the turk behold wonder at we for it be not their custom in those hot country to walk up and down as we do in cold country but to sit still on the ground like brute beast and one of they come unto we and ask we what we mean to walk up and down in such sort and whether we be out of our way or out of our wit if your way say he lie towards the upper end of the cloister why come you downward and if at the netherend why go you back again we answer he for our pleasure he reply that it be great pleasure to sit still than to walk up and down when we need not but their brutish sit still on the ground be as strange unto we as our walk up and down be to they it seem no less strange unto they to see a christian with a cut doublet and they call he fool and ask he what he mean to make hole in his coat for they neither cut nor pink any of their garment but wear they all plain spare for no cost to guard they with lace of silver and gold if they be able and such as wear long hair on their head the turk call sloven and account they savage beast for they themselves wear no hair on their head at all but shave they every week once and keep they warm with a turban of white shash make of cotton wool which they never uncover in their salutation to any man but bow their head with their hand on their breast but if a man have a fair long beard they reverence he and say he be a wise man and a honourable personage but if they have no beard at all they call they if they be young bardasses that be sodomitical boy but if they be man grow and have no beard they call they fool and man of no credit and some of they refuse to buy or sell with such and say they have no wit and that they will not believe they etc. march 23. we have a more pleasant way for the first ten mile we ride through the field and a very pleasant park but when we come out of this park or forest we be somewhat trouble partly by reason of the bad way and partly by bad people in the way the way be stony and rocky as the former day journey be but yet dry and not long for it be but the descend down a rocky hill where though the way be dangerous under our foot yet it be pleasant before our face for we behold the prospect of part of the holy land viz. Galilee but at our descend down this mountain the people do more trouble we then the way for there sit among the rock in our way many turk and arab with mace of iron and other weapon who stay we and demand Caphar or toll money we be glad to give they content that we may pass safe by they as jacob be glad to send his brother Esau gift for a as the lawyer speak that be for fear of danger but the caravan of christian who come after we though they be many hundred yet some of they be not able some not willing to pay so much money as they demand be shrewd beat with their iron maze there be a jesuite in their company who escape not without stripe whereat as I have hear he rejoice and count it meritorious in that he suffer such misery in so holy a voyage and in my hear at jerusalem one of his companion tell he that he merit much to sustain such travel and labour and be at so great cost and charge and suffer so many stripe for Christ sake but I know have it not be more for love of his purse than for love of Christ he may have escape without stripe yea with these kind speech Marhabbah that be welcome my friend or sweetheart at another place in my travel I hear a friar brag of his good work and say that he have do so many good work that if he shall kill three man his good work will make satisfaction and merit remission for they all to who one in my company answer that by his murder he may merit indeed a double reward viz. death in this life and damnation in the life to come for blood will have blood for whosoever shed man blood by man shall his blood be shed but to let pass these jesuitical jebusite or jebusiticall jesuit in that these traveller be thus beat for spare their purse and though they be many hundred dare not strike they again a admonition for traveller here I may fit take occasion to teach those that purpose to travel into Turkey how to behave themselves if they be set upon by thief they may defend themselves in their travel if they be strong enough but if they be poll officer as these be they must not be contradict but neither in their city nor in their travel may they strike again though they be abuse and beat by any man except they be thief and robber for if they do they shall either be put to death or have their hand cut off neither if a man receive a box on the ear at any of their hand must he give one bad word or look frown upon he that smite he for than he will strike he again and say what goure do thou curse i and wish that the devil have i but he must kiss his beard or the skirt of his garment and smile upon he and then he will let he pass wherefore traveller into those part must look upon the picture of a servant as of old he be wont to be paint that thereby they may learn how to behave themselves in travel I read that of old they be wont to paint the picture of a servant at the door of their house that their servant may see how they shall behave themselves and he be paint on this manner with the snout of a swine the ear of a ass the foot of a hart with hand open with his garment clean and on his head a bonnet have on his back a coulestaffe with two vessel the one have in it fire the other water this description though it be rude and homely yet it teach plain servant and traveller their duty the swine snout declare that they must not be dainty mouth but must be content with any meat which God have provide for man the ass ear that they must patient hear the sharp speech of their master without answer again the heart foot that they must be swift in do their business their hand wide open that they must be faithful not deceitful they must do nothing close or secret they must have their chest their hand their heart open to their master eye and commandment when it please he to call they to account their garment comely and honest which their bonnet declare that they must not be slovenly but handsome and seemly apparel and yet not proud above their degree the coulestaffe on their shoulder that they must not refuse to do any work no not to carry water and the fire and water the one before they and the other behind show their discretion in their business they must not mingle fire and water together most of these quality be require in traveller in diet they must not be dainty but eat what they can get their ear must not be nice for they shall hear speech enough to offend they their foot must be swift to fly from danger their hand wide open to give liberal their apparel also must be neat in city where they sojourn for their credit but when they travel abroad it must be simple for their safety for the base their apparel be the better shall they pass for if they wear good apparel their throat will be cut for their apparel and hope of much money for those that go brave they account rich and whereas in servant it be commendable to have ass ear in traveller it be needful to have ass back also to bear all abuse in good part and rather to bear a hundred abuse then to offer one wherefore servant and traveller must always remember this or couple of verse follow that be a noble kind of conquer be patience to see and hear he which forbear conquer if thou will conquer learn to bear but to leave these matter and to proceed to my voyage at the foot of this mountain there be a old cane where usual traveller lodge but it be not yet noon we resolve to travel 18 mile further to the sea of Galilee at the foot of this stony hill hard by this cane there run a pleasant river which divide Syria from Galilee and over this river there be a fair bridge the one end whereof be out of the holy land the other in it this river be call jordane jordan the head whereof come from mount Libanus and make three sea the first be the water of maron which we leave on our right hand about ten mile off the other on the left hand which lie in our way as we shall travel the second be the sea of Galilee or Tiberias or lake of Genezereth the three be the sea of Sodom call where the river jordan end the bridge that cross this river jordan at the entrance into the holy land be call Jacob bridge for two cause first it be say that there jacob meet his brother Esau second that there jacob wrestle with a Angel a description of the holy Land the whole holy land of old be call Chanaan and it be divide into three part viz. Galilee judea and Pale^tina late writer have call all by the name of Palestina the first part of Canaan call Galilee Jacob bridge begin at this bridge and to this day it be a very pleasant and fruitful country after we be enter into Galilee about 2. mile from the bridge our jenesarie ask we whether we will go up to a mountain and so to Saphetta near unto mount carmel which be a place of lean for Jew or keep the low way and go by the sea of Galilee which be the pleasant way and thereof we make choice and take Saphetta in our way afterward about seven mile from Jacob bridge our guide bring we to a well adorn with marble pillar and cover with stone which he say to have be the pit whereinto joseph be put when his brother sell he to the ishmalite but it seem to we incredible first because that be a dry pit and this be full of sweet water again jacob dwell at Hebron twelve mile beyond jerusalem and his son keep sheep in shechem and that dry pit whereinto they put joseph be at dothan which we see afterward and this pit which they show we with marble pillar be in Galilee not near dothan nor shechem where josephs brother keep their father sheep but by other of better judgement we understand that this also be call joseps pit or well because it be build by one josph not joseph the son of jacob but some other but the ignorant people which travel that way be apt to believe any thing that be tell they about ten mile from this well we come to a cane call by the moor Minium but by the turk Missia hard by the sea of Galilee where we lodge all night have travel that day by computation 36. mile the four and twenty of march we ride along by the sea of Galilee which John 6. 1. be call by two name viz. the sea of Galilee or Tiberias Galilee Galilee because it be in Galilee and Tiberias because the city Tiberias be build by it and Bethsaida a other ancient city of both which we see some ruinous wals. and it be say in that chapter John 6. 1. that jesus go over the sea of Galilee and in a other place that he go beyond the lake and Luke 9 10. it be say that he go into a slitary place near unto a city call Bethsaida which place of John I learn to understand better by see it than ever I can before by read of it for see that Tiberias and Bethsaida be both city on the same side of the sea and Christ go from Tiberias too or near unto Bethsaida I gather thereby that our saviour Christ go not over the length or breadth of that sea but over some arm bosom or reach thereof viz. so far as Tiberias be distant from Bethsaida which be also confirm in that it be say elsewhere a great multitude follow he on foot thither which they can not have do if he have go quite over the sea to the other side among the Gergelens which be out of the holy Land and therefore this sea of Galilee be also call the lake of Genesereth because the country of the Cergesens be on the other side the lake from whence the swine run headlong into the sea and be choke therein and as that place be out of the holy land so the people which then inhabit it be as far from holiness when they request our saviour Christ to depart out of their coast and such like holy people inhabit there still viz. wild arab and turk etc. we see also near unto this sea the place where that town mention John 2. 1. call Cana of Galilee stand where our saviour Christ at a marriage turn water into wine in place whereof there stand now a poor village inhabit by turk this sea of Galilee be by computation in length 8. league and in breadth 5. league and every league be three mile and than it enclose itself into a narrow compass carry but the breadth of a ordinary river until it come to Sodom where it end which be call that be the dead Sea after we have ride about seven mile by the sea of Galilee we leave it on our left hand and ascend up a mountain on the right hand this mountain be not very steepie but exceed pleasant and fertile for be the spring-time it be so beset with such variety of flower among the green grass that they seem to in our face and to laugh and sing as the psalmist speak as we go psal 65. 13. this be say to be that mountain mention John 6. 9 where our saviour Christ wrought a miracle in feed 5000. man with five barley loaf and two fish when we come to the top of the mountain we see Saphetta on the right hand a university of the jew where they speak Hebrew and have their synagogue there the city Saphet^a be situate on a very high hill with three top and so the city h^th three part one part be inhabit by jew the other two by turk we ask some jew who we know former to have be merchant of Aleppo what they mean to leave their trade and to live there they answer they be now old and come thither to die that they may be near to heaven we tell they that howsoever they may seem there to be near to heaven while they line because they dwell on a high mountain yet that they shall not be near unto heaven when they die unless they repent and believe in Christ etc. the jew have here more liberty then in any part of the holy land they dare not come to jerusalem for fear lest the christian there dwell stone they while we be at Saphetta many turk depart from thence towards Mecha in Arabia and the same morning they go we see many woman play with timbrel as they go along the street and make a yell or scrike noise as though they cry we ask what they mean in so do it be answer we that they mourn for the departure of their husband who be go that morning on pilgrimage to Mecha and they fear that they shall never see they again because it be a long way and dangerous and many die there every year it seem strange to we that they shall mourn with music about the street for music be use in other place at time of mirth and not at time of mourn but they do it but for a little custom sake and I doubt not but many of they be glad for their departure and will be glade if they will never come again they use they so kind and under pretence of devotion many travel to Mecha to buy their indian and persian commodity for many of they see their palpaple ignorance and in secret speak against it to those with who they may be bold and say their religion be nought yet be merchant to avoid poverty they travel thither among the rest so true be that common and commendable say Indos that be the merchant man though slow of soot to the indian shore do run by sea by land by fire by sword that poverty he may shun yea there be one of their chief learned man in Constantinople dom. 1604. speak against their Alcoran which be the book of all their religion but he lose his head for his labour which he willing and cheerful yield unto they all the way which we travel this day be very pleasant and all the ground both hill and dale very fruitful according as it be describe by Moses Deut. 8. 7. 8. and Deut. 11. 10 and 11. and we come that day about two of the clock in the afternoon to a village call in the arabic tongue j-nel tiger inel tiger that be by interpretation the marehants eye wherein there be two very fair castle for traveller to lodge in from danger of wild arab which abound in those part we take up our lodging in the near castle which be the fair after we have refresh ourselves tabor and sleep a while be hard by mount tabor we desire to ascend to the top of it and so much the rather because I have read that the papist to prove the primacy or supremacy of Peter above the rest of the apostle allege this for one argument after that Christ be transfigure upon mount tabor as we read matth. 17. 1. 2. etc. and there appear to they Moses and Elias talk with he Peter say to jesus master it be good for we to be here let we make here three tabernacle one for thou and one for Moses and one for Elias which say they at his request be do and remain there to this day which to make trial of we take Ally one of our jenesary and ride towards the mountain but understand that it be very dangerous by reason of wild arab which lodge in cave and rock and bush about the mountain mount tabor we hire some of the principal arab to go with we and guard we from the rest and as we go we behold the prospect of the mountain to be very pleasant somewhat steepy but not very high in respect of some other mountain thereabouts nor very large but a comely round mountain beset with tree and thick bush which at that time of the year flourish green we ride so far as we can for steepiness and then leave some of our servant at the foot of the mountain to keep our horse and take upon we to clamber up on foot which we shall never have be able to have do have there not be very high grass sprig and bush to hold by one of our arab go up before we as fast as if it have be even ground but we come very slow after which he perceive will look back and often use these word to cheer we gel gel gel that be come come come and sometime these be halac seeach how do you master we be almost all out of breath and one of our company cry for the love of God let we return for I can go no further oh I shall die I shall die whereupon one of we be near the top than he himself suppose to cheer the rest say come cheerful I be on the top which somewhat hartue the rest otherwise they have all go down again be on the top we rest a while to take breath and then we walk up and down the top of the mount and see only one house or rather low cottage uninhabited have only two dark room in it meet for fox or iackal to lodge in and see no sign of any other tavern or tabernacle only we understand that many year since there be a monastery there inhabit by popish friar but be molest by the arab take away the holiness with they and leave the mountain behind they yet still they call this mount tabor in italian santo that be the holy mountain as if there be some inherent holiness in the mountain and two day after we have be there come a jesuite and two friar with a young gentleman of Paris in France who be a Protestant and some other company with they conference betwixt a jesuite and a Protestant who have a desire to ascend to the top of this holy mountain and go all together until they be weary which be at the foot of the mountain and in the heat of the day wherefore the french gentleman say he will stay for they there until they return but be himself already weary and will go no high the jesuite and Frier reprove he and call he fool and tell he he do not know what he may merit by go to the top of that holy mountain merit-monger merit say the gentleman what may I merit thou may merit say they 50. year pardon the gentleman to break a jest with they ask they whether he may merit fifty year pardon for the time past or for the time to come if say he for the time past I be not so old for he be but twenty two year of age if for the time to come he do not think he shall live so long they answer he if he do not live so long he may give the year which remain to his friend yet can they not persuade he to go up any high the same jesuite call this french gentleman heretic because he do not profess himself a romanist he deny his argument and although he be not able to dispute with he scholarlike yet he answer he christian-like and tell he that he do abhor the name of Rome and the nature more the jesuite say thou scarce know the name much less the nature of Rome the gentleman reply I have read of both and that Rome have a name according to her nature he show by these verse follow jung as mare scio. the same in english Rome what be a love a love what love contrary unto kind how so Rome love man no more cease speech I know thy mind he further tell he that he have be at Rome and both see and hear there the manner of life which he and his fellow jesuit lead and that he be not ignorant how odious they be even unto other papist among who one of they give he a hymn make by a Papist at Rome against jesuit a copy whereof he give unto i which I have think good here to set down that the world may see that unity both in religion and conversation among they whereof they make such boast when as one sect of papist make rhythm and hymn to the disgrace of another in such ridiculous manner as follow jesuitae o carne * * a italian word signify grain wherewith they feed their poultry sit macherone * * a italian word signify bit or morsel piper o and vale the same in english this hymn the usual form do give in which the jesuit do live to wealthy city where the rather they most commodity may gather fly every jesuitish father best wine they drink and eat good bread with which no stranger see they feed nor note how long they lie in bed with gross beef they will never deal but for it fat and tender veal to their full kitchen still they steal jndian cock and turkey great feed always with the pure wheat be those bit that these father eat saffron pepper nourish they and rose of jerusalem of which no holy man do dream when prisoner for their charity call they say we be deprive of all and must to our devotion fall but when their mighty friend and rich require their help they God beseech for they and through all nation preach the inheritance of rich heir and prince nuptial affair dispose this feign zeal of they when rich lie sick and these man gape to have their riches feed their rape they pray God they may never escape o wild and wolvish chevisance that when they charity advance they ravish our inheritance venetian wealth they still apply affect the spanish gravity and build on Rome authority if princely office be seek by jesuit they must be wrought and with rich spiritual live buy in temporal state they bear the bell in spiritual state as much excel in all state they command farewell we ourselves when we have see enough this mount return again to the castle with good stomach to our supper and weary body desire rest tabor be distant from Galilee not much above twenty mile march 25. be the feast of the annunciation of the virgin Mary and according to the computation of our church of England the first day of the year 1601. we travel over very pleasant field all the way the field of Basan not far from the mount Basan mount Basan where there be exceed good pasture and fat cattle only we want good water to drink and our wine be spend and the day exceed hot we see in our way some remnant of that old tower or fortress mention 2. King 5. 24. where Gehazi the servant of elisha overtake naaman and take of he two talent of silver and two change of garment we see also many other place worthy observation but for want of a good guide we know not the name thereof for the turk inhabit those country have give new name to most place this be the pleasant day journey we have in our whole travel I never see more fertile ground and pleasant field and so much together all the whole day from mount tabor to a village call vulgar jenine but of old en-gannim en-gannim whereof we read Josh. 15. 34. near unto this village be the place where joel behead Sisera mention judg. 4. 21. en-gannim be distant from mount tabor twenty two mile it be a very pleasant place have fine garden and orchard and water about it we stay here all the day march 26 because the turk romadan which be their lent be end on this day begin their feast call byram and our jenesarie be loath to travel on that day be their feast day and so much the rather because his name also be byram march 27. ride from en-gannim we be endanger twice first by certain thief dwell near unto en-gannim who make we pay Caphar or pole money twice once at en-gannim and when we depart from thence they pursue we with bow and arrow and other weapon we withstand they long in parley at length every man prepare his instrument of death ready for battle our jenesary kinsman Fa^olla have his musket ready and be about to give fire be stay by our jenesarie who see not only these arab present very desperate with their bow and arrow ready draw but messenger also send to raise up all the whole rabblement thereabouts upon we he tell we we be best give they content or else we be all but dead man wherefore to avoid further danger we give they their own desire upon condition they will pursue we no further nor suffer any of their company to molest we the chief of they answer stopherlo stopherlo that be God forbid God forbid we shall do you any harm if you pay we what we demand which we do with all speed and ride away from they be glad we be rid of they about ten mile from they we ride through a wood a very fit place to harbour thief who have kill certain man travel that way the day before and take away both a man and horse from the caravan which follow after and a woman also ride on a ass with their carriage and as our guide tell we he never travel that way but he see some man kill and therefore bid we all charge our piece and shoot off when he bid we though we see no body lest the wild arab shall set upon we on the sudden lie in ambush which we also do in a place most dangerous to daunt the enemy before we see each other but before we come unto the most dangerous place there overtake we many turk well arm who dwell in Jerusalem and be glad of our company thither and short after we have discharge every man his piece we see a great company of arab on a high mountain near unto our way yet out of the reach of our shot who perceive we to be too strong for they dare not set upon we and so by the providence of God we come that night to a ancient and famous city Samaria situate in a fruitful valley betwixt two mountain call Sychar a city in Samaria mention John 4. near whereunto we see Jacob well where our saviour Christ ask water of the woman of Samaria Sychar we come thither in good time for we be exceed thirsty Jacob well and drink thereof liberal and free the water thereof go down very pleasant like unto milk from Jacob well we go into the city and lodge in a very ancient and stately cane but very bad keep it have be better for we to have sleep by Jacob well as other do for here we sleep on the hard stone near unto a chapel in the middle of the cane under two or three great fig tree and mulberry tree where we be scarce safe from thief for we have some thing steal from we in the night while we sleep under the tree on fair broad stone whereunto we ascend by a fair stone pair of stair six or seven step from the ground Sychar be distant from en-gannim 27. mile march 28. we stay at this city in Samaria call of old Sychar Napolis but at this day common Napolis for the holy land have be often conquer have have new name impose unto all the chief city and most other town and village also partly by God^rey of bullome who conquer that country in the year 1098. but chief by the turk who conquer the holy land and all the country about it have change the name of place to root out all memorial of revenge in the heart of posterity as they suppose yet the chief city be still know by their ancient name though other name have be give thereunto as for example dam^s^^s which be so call of old be still know by that name though the tuck call it Sha^ and jeru^alem which they call cu^ or rather kud come as I suppose of the Hebrew word (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) Kadasch which signify to sanctify or to be holy or of Kadosch which signify holy and as they themselves say the word cut or kud whereby they call it signify a holy city in their language the cause of our stay this day at Sychar be this it be tell we that 2. emeer or great lord in our way to jerusalem be up in arm one against a other and therefore it seem good to our jenesary that we shall stay for the that we may be the strong and pass safe but when the Caravan come they pitch their tent by Jacob well and purpose to stay there two or three day at the least we be loath to stay so long be now but thirty mile from jerusalem and therefore resolve to proceed in our journey without any long expectation for company which be uncertain March 29. we depart from Samaria to jerusalem and meet many soldier in several company by the way who know our jenesary and other turk in our company let we pass by they quiet and give we the that be peace be unto you the first part of this day journey be somewhat pleasant but the near we come to Jerusalem the more barren and tedious our way be about ten of the clock we come to a great forest or wilderness full of tree and mountain when we be on the top of this mountain we see the main sea on our right hand and small ship sail towards joppa about three or four of the clock we come to a ruinous village call beer beer but of old as it be report Beersheba which in former time be a great city and it be say to be the place where Joseph and Mary come from Jerusalem the feast be end miss the child jesus and seek he sorrow and return to Jerusalem find he in the temple amid the doctor hear they and pose they our purpose be to lodge here all night be all of we weary and hungry and all our provision spend but find nothing here to be have for money either for man or horse and understand that jerusalem be but ten mile off we go on in our way somewhat faint five or six mile jerusalem and then behold the prospect of the city we be somewhat cheer and revive and solace ourselves with sing of psalm until we come near unto the city many greek dwell in jerusalem see we a far off come to meet we suppose their patriarch have be in our company who come two or three day after we we dismount from our horse at the west gate of the city joppa gate call joppa gate or the castle gate which be a very strong gate of iron with thirteen piece of brass ordinance plant on the wall about the gate we stay in the porch of this gate and may not be admit into the city until we be search by a officer as the manner be in the mean time there come to we two italian friar viz. padre Angelo and padre Aurel^o and kiss our hand and bid we welcome and tell we that two other englishman be at their house viz. master timberley and master Borell when we be search without the gate by a turkish officer and deliver up our weapon to the porter to keep for we in the gatehouse until our return because no christian may enter into jerusalem with weapon these two Padres lead we to their monastery at the gate whereof we be search again by another turkish officer before we may enter into the house for the office of the former searcher at the gate of the city be only to receive the weapon of all christian and deliver they safe to they again at their departure but this searcher go further and search all our carriage which he cause to be open to see whether we have any gunpowder or any other engine there for they be very suspicious of all christian fear lest for devotion to the place they shall work treason therefore they suffer not christian to enter into the city weapon lest they make insurrection against they when they be many together and conquer the city as heretofore they have do to this end also be the city wall about with strong wall and fortify with four strong gate and a castle build by sultan Soliman and every gate well plant with ordinance for fear of christian and partly for hope have they environ this city with such strong wall that christian for devotion to the place may come and build within the wall and be subject to the Turk for though their wall be large and strong yet there be great room within the wall to build more house than be there for there be field of corn within the wall of the city and the house stand very thin scatter and disperse here one and there two or three together there be not one fair street in all jerusalem as it now be after they have thus narrow search all our carriage even to our case of bottle we be admit into the monastery at the entrance whereinto meet we master timberley and master boreel and then signior Franciscus the padre guardian of the monastery and all the rest in order and bid we welcome and lead we into a fair parlour and set good cheer before we and serve we themselves after supper we deliver they our letter which we have bring from the Venice consul of Aleppo and other italian merchant there in our behalf which when they have read the guardian say our custom be when stranger come to we to call they the first night to mass and to confession and to give every man a candle to hold in his hand at mass time and at night to wash their foot and to bring they to bed and to many other ceremony during the whole time of their continuance there but as for we they understand by letter what we be and tell we that we be so high commend by their patroness and benefactor the Venice consul and merchant of Aleppo that if they shall show we half the favour which be require at their hand they shall themselves lie without door and suffer we to rule and domineer at our pleasure and that therefore they will not urge we to any thing against our conscience but give free liberty both of person and conscience as if we be in England or in our own house elsewhere and so much the rather because they understand our merchant be rich and hope to gain by we in regard whereof although it be lend wherein they eat no flesh yet offer we hen egg milk any thing that be there to be have for money they request we to command it and during the time of our continuance there he command one padre Aurelio to attend upon we and see that we want nothing and another of his brother one padre Angelo to be our guide abroad and to show we all ancient monument and place worth see either in the city or out of the city these kind speech be use they bring we to our chamber where we shall lodge all night and provide for very man several a good neat bed with fair sheet and all thing very wholesome and handsome where we sleep sweet and refresh our weary body all that night very comfortable but although they deal thus kind with we at the instance of their benefactor in give we liberty of conscience yet they deal not so with other for some I do know who have be there and make no conscience to do as they have do according to those verse Romano vi^ito more that be when they be at Rome they do what there be do when they be elsewhere they do as they do there but they shall rather remember that which Baptista a italian write of Rome the same in english will thou live well depart from Rome all thing there lawful be except to be a godly man which thing be rare to see the same Baptista write of they thus the same in english Rome fall temple priest and altar fire frankincense and prayer yea heaven and God himself for gold at Rome be to be buy and sell wherefore a admonition to such a^ travel to jerusalem I admonish those who have a desire to travel to Jerusalem hereafter to take heed to themselves that they make not shipwreck of conscience for if they come not well commend or well money or both there be no be for they except they partake with they in their idolatrous service true it be that the turk give liberty of conscience unto all that come thither but they give not entertainment unto any christian in their house and the greek patriarch be poor and not able to protect such as come unto they for refuge these Padres though they be papist yet have they rich benefactor and want nothing and for the most part very kind and courteous to stranger in all thing liberty of conscience only except wherein they seek to make other like unto themselves and to seduce they from their faith and to win they to the church of Rome and offer unto they who have money in their purse to make they knight of the sepulchre but no good english subject will accept of that order of knighthood for at the receive thereof they swear to be true to the pope and to the king of Spain and to other thing which no man can do with a good conscience and this kindness and liberty of conscience which we find among they we impute not so much to the man as to our own money for it cost we viz. 100 ducat for our entertainment for we know they to be of the court of Rome and be not ignorant that that be the court of Rome no sheep do receive unless to they her fleece she leave and as one John a monk write of they and arcas Papas and and arcas fers Sta Fero quo^ the same in english the court of Rome do aim at mark it suck the purse and soak the arke if that you mind to spare your arke come not at pope nor patriarch but if you frank give they mark and with good gold stuff up their arke I warrant than you shall be free from any kind of penalty who be within who there i i. why what will you come in bring you aught no. stand still but I do go you then in the same monk write that Rome be found by thief retain still somewhat of her old quality for say he she be call of grease the hand the same in english Rome be a raker and spiteful hater of the empty hand she hear the giver but other never but let they stand her court a cage of care of mischief eke the mother she use knave like honest man and stranger like a brother well though we be fleece among they yet have we liberty of conscience and safety of person and have no way any wrong offer we by they either in word or deed but by two or three jesuitical jebusite who be stranger there as well as we some unkindness be offer we behind our back for they dare not any way deal with we to our face in rail upon we and our religion as it be tell we at our departure by one who hear they especial by a jesuite name but undeserved Benedictus and yet he can neither nor neither say well nor do well by any that be not of their sect and sort and therefore deserve not to be call Benedictus but Antiphrafin but rather as one of our company write unto he in this manner in meet although barbarous true although not poetical benedict pervert maledicte the same in english o Benedict hear hold thy peace do well say well o scorner else let thy name be Meledict pervert all the former after we have rest one night in jerusalem the first day we walk about the city ourselves without our guide only to view the city not inquire of any place what it be because on the morrow after and every day during our continuance which be about fourteen day our guide either walk on foot resolution of a doubt concern Peter warm himself in the high priest hall or ride with we to see all thing worthy observation only one thing I observe and due consider the first day I come which be this that where as we read in the gospel that when our saviour Christ be betray and bring into the high priest hall Peter follow he stand by the fire and warm himself the reason be there yield because it be cold and the memorial neereof we observe in march or April we be there at the same season of the year find it exceed hot and hot than it be usual at midsummer in England it seem strange unto i how it shall then be so cold that Peter shall creep to the fire and now at the same season so hot that we can not endure the heat of the sun and on the sudden I know not whether the season be alter or the passion of Christ may be refer to some cold season of the year but after I have be there a few day the very place resolve that doubt for there fall great dew and before the sun have dry it up it be cold and in the night season about that time of the year somewhat cold as I feel by experience when I sleep in the field all night and Peter have watch with Christ in the night may well be cold in the morning before the heat of the sun have expel cold and yet another reason in my judgement more effectual than the former 2. reason may be yield for this matter take that as the same night that Christ be bear there be great light at midnight in token of comfort and at the time of his death great darkness at noon day in token of sorrow for the sun put on his mourn garment and be ashamed to look upon that cruelty which the son of man be not afraid to commit so at the time of his betray there may be extraordinary cold wether in that a extraordinary person suffer and a extraordinary work be in hand and extraordinary thing happen about the time of his passion as we read in the gospel viz. how the grave do open the dead body of saint which sleep arise the veil of the temple do rend in twain from the top of the bottom the earth do tremble and the stone do cleave asunder these thing declare that a notable person suffer the like alteration may be in the coldness of the air and alteration of wether and although we read it not in express word yet since I have see jerusalem it seem to i that it may be gather from that place of the gospel where it be say Simon Peter warm himself for if we true calculate the time the season of the year be hot ordinary and Simon Peter at that season of the year be so cold that he be drive to the fire and therefore it shall seem to be unseasonable wether and extraordinary cold these consideration have satisfy myself however they satisfy other until I hear or read some more sufficient reason jerusalem be in Palestina antiquity of jerusalem it be the goodly city that ever be in the east part of the world it be first call Moria where Adam be create of the red earth of moriah a mount in jerusalem which moriah be one of the head of Zion hill where Isaac be offer as a figure of Christ the holy of holy gen. 22. 2. which place be afterward call Salem where sem or Melchisedech dwell where afterward Isaac be offer and upon his offering it be call jerusalem gen. 14. 18. where be the thresh place of Araunah the jebusite and of old jerusalem be also call jebus 2. sam. 24. 16. where Solomon be command to build the temple 2. Chron. 3. 1. and it be call Hieron Solomonis that be to say Solomon temple and after by corruption Hierosolyma a particular declaration of such thing as we see at jerusalem divide into three part after we have rest one day at jerusalem or walk for our pleasure up and down all the rest of the day of our continuance there we have our guide with we who have dwell there fourteen year and show we all such place as be worthy view or visit both in jerusalem and many mile round about jerusalem and we give he the hear of all but do not believe all for they seem to i to be of three sort viz. 1 either apparent truth 2 manifest untruth 3 or thing doubtful those I account apparent truth which I can either confirm by read orie^son the ch^e^est whereof I will brief set down for it be too to write ^ll refer the rest to i next letter or conference at our good meeting which I hope in good time God will grant we apparent truth and first of all it seem to i a manifest truth that jerusalem that now it stand in the same place where the old jerusalem do not in every respect for length b breadth but with some difference for whereas we read in the gospel that they crucify our saviour Christ at Golgotha without the city near whereunto there be a new sepulchre wherein never man lie and therein they lay his bless body now both mount Caluari^ where Golgotha that be the place of dead man skull be and the sepulchre at least wise the place where the sepulchre be be all enclose within the wall of the city which be build by sultan Solyman or sultan selim. so that although some difference there be yet it be not so great but that a man may bold affirm that part of this city be now in the same place where the old jerusalem stand and a part thereof somewhat remove yet some who have never be there have presume to affirm that no man know the place where old Jerusalem stand and that no sign of the city be to be see but that the place be still the same it be manifest by the situation thereof which be describe in the scripture to have be near unto these mountain moriah Zion Caluarie mount Olivet Bethan^a and behap ^age and not far^e from bedlam which mountain and place be there still to be see and call still by the same name and whereas they say no sign of the city be to be see ground their assertion upon a place of scripture false apply and say that Christ promise to destroy jerusalem and not to leave one (@) upon another that shall not be overthrow if they read the place Luke 21. 6. they shall find that speak of the temple which they apply unto the city and I do very persuade nay self that even in Jerusalem that now be there be stone upon stone yet left which we^e never overthrow since the first building of the city for on the foundation of the wall in many place especial towards mount Olive^ there be yet stone to be see which both for quantity and quality may be think to have be there ever since the beginning for they be of huge length and breadth and of a black colour like whereunto I never see any in any other place of all my travel and over these old stone the upper part of the wall be a new building differ both in colour and quantity from the foundation stone but of the temple it be true which our saviour Christ speak luk. 21. 6. for when as the prophet denounce god judgement unto the jew unless they repent they flatter themselves in their sin and cry the temple of the lord the temple of thy Lord but through their profanation they make the temple of the lord a den of thief they cry lord lord but they do not his will on who they cry for sweet grape they yield sour for hearty and sincere service hypocritical and paint show of religion their glory be in the external beauty of their material temple they wonder at the stone and goodly building at the gorgeous furniture and precious gift wherewith it be both outward and inward adorn and enrich whereupon our saviour to take away the cause of this vain hope and foolish joy take occasion thus to prophecy of that glorious temple be these the thing that you look upon the day will come wherein there shall not be leave a stone upon a stone which shall not be destroy this prophecy be as evident accomplish as it be make for thirty eight year after they have crucify Christ their promise Messiah the lord of glory God raise up the servant of his wr^th Vespasian and Titus emperor of Rome who besiege conquer and raze their jerusalem make havoc of the people as of dog murder eleven hundred thousand man woman and child of that curse nation then be fulfil they cry of those crucifier his blood be upon our head and upon our child it have be and shall be for ever yea the violence of the roman proceed further and pull down the temple and lay it flat with the ground insomuch that according to the express word of our saviour prophecy they leave not one stone upon another the jew sundry time have obtain leave of julian the attempt to build it up again but it will not be for what their hand build in the day the hand of the lord most miraculous hurl down and burn with lightning by night the foundation thereof be shake with earthquake and at this present day there be build in the place thereof a Muskia or turkish church whereunto no Christian may have access it be not in the form of Salomon temple but after the manner of their turkish building not for the service of the true God but of the false prophet Mahomet unto the truth also of sundry other particular which they (...) show we do I subscribe and first of all that at bedlam six mile from jerusalem be the very place where our saviour Christ be bear although now they have make it more beautiful be build of marble at the cost of queen Helena the mother of Constantine who some report to have be a english woman bear at Colechester who have there also erect a stately church which to this day be very well keep they tell we also that s. Hierome dwell there which can be deny from bedlam we ride seven mile further ziph. to the desert of Ziph or wilderness of judah where David hide himself when he be persecute be Saul we go also to the hill country of judea where the virgin Mary salute Elizabeth the wife of zacharias judea mother of John Baptist be great with child and at her salutation the babe spring in her belly from thence we ride further to the wilderness of judaea where John Baptist preach and in the middle of the descend of a mountain they show we a chamber hew out of a lively rock four square with a door and a window and a place for his bed and table by which place there issue a fine spring of water out of the rock at which place we drink of the water from thence return to jerusalem they show we in the way to Gaza the water where Philip baptize the eunuch act. 8. 38. at our return to jerusalem they bring we to mount Olivet from whence our saviour Christ ascend into heaven be from jerusalem a sabbath day journey not two mile from the mount of olive we go to bethania and bethphage which be now ruinous village there be many fig tree still grow about these two village and many olive tree about the mount of olive we cut off some of the branch and carry some sprig with we near jerusalem they show we mount Zion and the mount mo^^^h on which Abraham offer his son Isaac we see also the valley of jehosaphat and the valley of jehinnom and the brook Cedron which be now in the summer time a dry channel some part of the tower of Sylo and the pool Syloam and the potter field buy with the thirty piece of silver which judas have for betray his master Christ call acheldama which to this day be a place to bury stranger in ascend up acheldama we enter into a porch and look down into a vault where we see many dead body cover only with their wind sheet knit at the head and foot without any coffin and some of their sheet be so white that they seem to we to have be bury but few day before we come the valley betwixt acheldama and mount Zion be call the vale of jehinnom the valley of jehosaphat be three mile in length reach from the vale of jeh^^nom to a place without the city which they call the sepulchre of the king last they bring we to mount Caluarie to the place where Christ be crucify over which there be now erect a stately build with many isle chancel or little chapel in it for sundry nation which be all there at that present time as we be and lodge there on Saturday at night before palm Sunday we enter into this temple to see the sepulchre on Saturday after dinner and come not forth until Monday about eleven of the clock for there be lodging adjoin unto it into which we enter through the high chancel or chapel before we be admit hereunto every man pay nine shekine to see the sepulchre which money the syniacke or chief ruler of the city have who be a Turk into the sepulchre we go but one at a time with our guide the entrance thereinto be low and narrow the place itself be but the length of a ordinary sepulchre it be now as high as a altar or table of fair marble stone and there be lamp continual burn night and day that this sepulchre stand in the same place as the sepulchre do wherein the body of our saviour Christ be lay we make no doubt because it be agreeable to the circumstance of scripture whereby the place be describe but I ask our guide whether any part of the self-same sepulchre wherein the bless body of our saviour be lay be to be see there he answer i that some part of it be at Rome and some other part of it lay enclose under that altar but not to be see and further he tell i that at the first after the resurrection of our saviour Christ all the whole sepulchre be to be see for many year space until stranger who come to visit it begin to break off piece and to carry they away than it be enclose with bar and to be see through the bar but not to be touch as some sepulchre in saint Paul church in London be yet they see inconvenience herein in that many use to cast into it the first hair of their child and some candle and other thing as a offering thereunto so that the place can not be keep neat wherefore queen Helena cause it to be enclose in such sort as it now be and cover it with marble but whether any part of the self same sepulchre be underneath the same or not it give i content that I have see the self same place where the sepulchre of our bless saviour be as I in heart do then and do still persuade myself it be many superstitious papist except on their knee to the sepulchre mumble up their prayer upon head as they go according to the definition of popery which be right define by Baptista to be a religion popery be a religion which use to patter Mar^ upon bead and the not far from thence be the sepulchre of Godfroy of Bul^oyn^ and king Baldewyn who conquer that country in the year 1098. and both of they lie there bury with the whole proportion of their body in stone with these epitaph about they a inscription write about the sepulchre of Godfroy of Bulloyne at jerusalem Godfridus de Bul'ion in pace amen that be here lie famous GOD^ROY of Bulloine who get all this land to the worship of God who soul rest in peace amen and near unto it about king baldwine tomb these verse be write Machabaeus vigour Caesar aegypti Dan Damascus dolour in the same in english another judas Machabaeus king baldwyn here do rest his country hope the church strength the virtue both possess who murderous Damascus fear egyptian Caesar Dan bring gift and tribute yet alas this small tomb hold this man this Godfrey of Bulloine be the first proclaim Christian king of jerusalem who refuse to be crown there say that it be unfit that the servant head shall there be crown with gold where the master head have be crown with thorn jerusalem be govern by turk but inhabit by christian of sundry nation whereof some come only to visit and superstitious to worship there and so return into their country other come thither to dwell and exercise their manual art with a purpose there to die think that they shall soon go to heaven if they die there than in any other place there be at jerusalem when we be there christian of sundry nation especial armenian whereof some be call georgian and some jacobite their patriarch be not there but least sick at Aleppo but in his place he send a armenian bishop there be also many greek Chel^alines nostranes o^ nazaritan cofty and Abassens or aethiopian of prestar john country whereof some of they dwell near unto catadupa which be a place in Aethiopia where the fall of the river Nilus make such a noise that the people be make deaf therewith that dwell near it beside many italian frenchman dutchman and we five englishman many turk also visit the sepulchre of Christ for they both think and speak very reverent of Christ and though they do not believe to be save by Christ yet they say he be a great prophet but that Mahomet be great and usual when they have end their ceremony at Meccha at their return they visit the sepulchre of Christ at jerusalem for they have a opinion that unless they visit the sepulchre of Christ and the holy land as well as the sepulchre of Mahomet their pilgrimage to Mecha be to no purpose nor acceptable to God but I see not one jew in all jerusalem for they be so hateful to the christian there that they seldom come thither manifest untruth beside these and many other matter which we there see and hear which I account manifest truth because there be scripture or reason for they or both they show and tell unto we and especial unto other who will believe they many thing which be false and ridiculous whereof to avoid tediousness I will name only some few refer the rest to next letter or to our good meeting which it may please God in good time to grant we at bedlam they bring we into the place which at Christ birth be a stable for ox and ass but now a beautiful place build of stone and adorn with a manger of marble and a crach over it with a ox and a ass of marble stone and the bless babe in the midst and the virgin Mary sit by and look up to the roof of the house they show we a hole make of purpose in the very top of the house and tell we that through that hole the star fall down which direct the three king of Collen of Christ wherein they deliver three untruth 1 in say that the star fall down into the room whereas the scripture say not that it fall down but stand over the place where the babe be matth. 2. 9 2. second they err in say that they be three king of Colyn or colonia Agrippina as it be call whereas the text say there come wise man from the east to Jerusalem colonia be not east from jerusalem 3. three they err in set down the number of they to be three because they bring three gift which be not so to be take but only that they which come present unto he the chief commodity of their country yet at colonia they persuade themselves to this day that three king go from thence to Jerusalem at the time of Christ birth to worship he for I have occasion to travel through Germany stay at colonia Agrippina one day and go into the chief church of the city where I see these verse write on the wall Myrrah dea. Myrrah Pro thure the same in english three king unto the king of king three gift at once present which be myrrh gold and frankincense gold as he be anoint myrrh to he as he be a man and frankincense as God so by thou in like sort must be three zealous gift bestow for gold present a perfect heart for myrrh admit he tear for frankincense power from thy breast a ^ume of humble prayer I have conference there with some who will be count learned and they understand that place of three king who go from their city colonia to bedlam to worship Christ at the time of his birth and very obstinate and absurd defend it in the way betwixt Jerusalem and bedlam they take upon they to show the place to ignorant traveller where the angel take up abackuck the prophet by the hair of the head to carry meat to Daniel in the lion den but they may do well first to prove that there be such a thing do before they demonstrate the place where it be do another matter of like sort they demonstrate in the way betwixt jerusalem and bedlam which be the terebinth or turpentine tree under which the virgin Mary sit when she give her child suck travel on foot betwixt those two city and yet another in the same way as absurd as the rest which be this in the high way or lane betwixt jerusalem and bedlam they show a great broad stone immovable and evenwith the ground be a natural rock where the prophet Elias in his travel be wont to sleep and shame not to say that he sleep so often upon that stone that the very impression of his body remain in that stone to be see to this day truth it be indeed that there be in a stone that way some hollow place but no formal proportion of a man and who be so simple to think that it may not rather come by the often fall of the rain upon it then by often sleep on it according to that verse gutta 6 that be the drop of rain make hollow the stone by often fall thereupon yea they not only tell we these false and frivolous matter but also read unto we as vain and fabulous matter as the^e for while we be at table at dinner in bedlam in company with many friar one of they read a chapter out of their golden legend in latin until the guardian of bedlam perceive that we give no ear thereunto but confound the part of their meal enjoin he silence for it be their custom to divide their meal into three part the first be a method in (@) that be deep silence which be not only while they be say grace but while one of they read a chapter out of their legend of lie which they call the golden legend and say that it excel all other book yea the bible itself as far as gold excel other metal but why that book shall be call a golden legend say Vives I do not know sith it be write by a man of a iron mouth and a leaden heart the second be that be chap and chew grind and grate their meat with their tooth the three be rumour that be chat and prate talk and tell of news but we be weary of walk four mile on foot from bedlam to Solomon fishpond and the fountain enclose under the earth at our return to bedlam we be weary and hungry and be no soon set at table but after some short we fall to and while the rest of the friar be at their give ear to the fable read out of their legend we be at the three part of our meal viz. rumor talk both of foreign and domestical matter at jerusalem on mount Caluarie in the house erect over the sepulchre they show unto stranger a marble pillar whereunto they say our saviour be bind when he be whip for our sake but who be so simple to think that there be any marble pillar erect without the city for such a purpose to punish offender as they account our saviour Christ at that day or who know the particular place where he be imprison at this day yet say they this be the place where Christ be imprison while they be make his cross and this be the place where the cross be lay a long our saviour be fasten or nail unto it and this be the place where the cross stand and have make there two hole in sign of it as though the neither part of his cross consist of two part or pillar and near unto the tower of Sylo they show a water come from under a rock which they call the pool Syloam and there say they do the virgin Mary wash the child clout and near unto the sepulchre there be a great stone cleave with hammer and set one piece a foot from another and this say they be the veil of the temple which rend in sunder at the time of Christ suffering which be most ridiculous and although it be true as we read Luke 19 29. 30 etc. that Christ ride on that ass which his two disciple bring from the village over against mount Olivet call bethania or bethphage for they be both together and as he ride from the mount of olive to jerusalem the people cry hosanna and spread their garment in the way and cut down branch from the tree and straw they in the way yet it be a ridiculous matter and a superstitious custom for their chief friar call padre guardian every palm Sunday in the morning to send two of his friar from the mount of olive to Betha^ia to fetch the colt of a ass and from thence in a apish imitation of Christ the great one ride on the little one towards jerusalem and the rest spread their garment on the ass and in the way and cut down branch from the tree and straw they in the way wise be the turk herein then they who although they suffer they to come with their ass to the gate of jerusalem yet admit they not to enter into the gate in such manner and that Turk be to be commend who when the friar follow their guardian in such sort ride on a ass see a simple christian woman strip herself so far as in modesty she may and spread her garment in the way take a cudgel and all to belabored she therewith say thou fool be thou so mad to think that this be Christ ay with the rest of my companion be at jerusalem on palm Sunday but neither see this no hear of it until it be do for it seem that they be ashamed that any man of knowledge shall behold such a absurd sight but the frenchman and dutchman and many other of other nation follow they but not one Englishman who can not patient endure to see their saviour Christ so dishonour at bethania and bethphage be many fig-tree grow and on this fig tree say they zacheus be a man of worship in a famous city like a boy climb up to see Christ as he pass by Luke 19 2 3. and at jerusalem they take upon they to show the place where Christ make the and where the apostle make the creed and where s. Stephen be stone and where judas hang himself Pilat house Peter prison the garden where he be betray where the virgin Mary be in a agony where Christ say to his mother and she say unto he on mount Olivet there be a little chapel and therein a stone whereon say they our saviour Christ tread when he ascend into heaven and the print of his toe remain to be see in that stone to this day there be indeed a dint in a stone like unto the former part of a man foot but that it be the print or impression of our saviour foot who will believe that he tread so hard to leave any impression of his foot or tip of his toe behind at the foot of mount Olivet they show we the valley of jehosapha and there say they shall be set a throne at the day of judgement wherein Christ shall sit and keep his last judgement and all nation shall appear before he even in this very place say they as though any man can demonstrate the very particular place the ground of this opinion they fetch from joel 3. 2. where God say I will g^ther all nation and will bring they down into the valley of jehosaphat etc. which place they do not or will not understand for it be to be understand either by the way of allude as have regard to the valley where God miraculous slay the enemy of Jehosaphat and so it may signify the valley of destruction prepare for the wicked or the lord have respect unto the word jehosaphat which signify plead or judgement because God will in the day of Christ judge the enemy of the church as than he do in the valley of Jehosaphat wherefore it be not to be understand of the material Josaphat but of Josaphat so term because the judgement which here shall be pronounce shall resemble that which there be execute upon the moabite and amonite and the inhabitant of Seir. for what be josaphat if you interpret it but the judgement of the lord and what be the valley but the depth of that judgement into which Solomon do assure the young man that God will bring he after all the jollity of his youth after he have cheer himself in the day of his youth and walk in the way of his heart and in his sight Eccl. 11. 9 after conference have with their padre who be account the best learned among they have tell he thus much in effect as I have here write he ask i a reason why the prophet shall specify this place if he mean not literal to teach the church that here this judge be to be expect my answer be two reason have he to make choice of it by allusion to which he may shadow to the jew the day of judgement one be the freshness of that famous deliverance memory which the lord have wrought in it for they another the great resemblance that will be between the general and that particular judgement of he for from the time of this prophet yet have there not a man age pass since without stroke of they the lord have in this valley within the sight of this city dispatch three whole army which have join force to beleaguer they and further in such sort as in that general judgement he will dispatch the wicked for as here though the Moabite the amonite and the inhabitant of seir bind themselves against juda and yet can not prevail so there though the moabitish flesh the amonitish world the savage inhabitant of seir the devil enter a league against the elect yet shall they have no hand at they as they have so shall these and their complice have sword of their own conscience accuse they to turn into their own bowel and as the same place be to they a valley of judgement which to the jew be a valley of blessing so shall that great day be to the wicked a day of judgement for they shall receive that heavy doom go you curse which to the godly shall be a day of blessing for they shall hear that joyful voice come you bless etc. this friar be not satisfy with this answer but persist obstinate in his error and therefore I leave he as I find he refer he to the trial thereof at the day of judgement they say also that the stair of the high priest hall whereupon our saviour tread when he go to be judge be at Rome and the nail which nail he to his cross but the ecclesiastical history report that Constantine make of those nail when his mother have find they in the mount where Christ be crucify a bridle and a helmet for his own use so big be the nail and such wide wound they make in his bless hand and foot that they be rather dig than pierce which also David foreshow by these word psal 22. 16. and in the way from that which they call the high priest hall or the judgement hall towards mount calvary at the end of the lane on the right hand here say they they meet Simon of Cyren and compel he to help Christ to bear his cross when he faint and go down another lane on the left hand they point unto a house and say here the rich glutton dwell who refuse to relieve Lazarus which be a parable and not a history and though it be a true history yet who can point with the finger at the particular place where the house stand jerusalem have be so often alter and transform from thence turn up towards mount Caluarie on the right hand Veronica they show unto such as they think will believe they the house where a woman call Veronica dwell who see our saviour Christ pass by her door towards mount Caluarie and all in a sweat she bring forth a that be a napkin or handkerchief to wipe his face which he receive and have wipe his face therewith give it to she again and therein say they remain the print of his face and be to be see at s. Peter house at Rome to this present day there be also a city in Spain which brag of the same handkerchief and the one be as like to be true as the other but both can be true if they have it at Rome it can be at Spain if at Spain not at Rome if there be any such matter for if both shall be true to which of they shall that prayer be say which John the 22. pope of that name publish and grant ten thousand day indulgence to they that devout say this prayer follow behold either the picture of Veronica or the handkerchief which as they say Christ give unto she with the print of his face therein in 6 Christiana and o FELIXFIGURA the same in english God save thou holy face of our saviour wherein the form of divine light do shine fix in a little clout of snowy colour leave on the Vernicle as thy love sign God save thou world repute mirror of saint which the celestial spirit desire to see cleanse we from every spot of vice taint and range we in their rank that bless be of our lord face God save thou image bless deck wondrous with the eternal bliss with power give to thou lighten thou our breast and free our sense from in comberance God save thou fortress of our christian creed who heretic with mind mislead of those believe thou augment the meed by the image of thou make a king of Bread preserve our joy in grief life which be this slide and frail soon go and most unsure o happy FIGURE lead we to thy bliss to see thy face o Christ which be so pure they take upon they also to show the place where Christ appear unto Mary and say touch i not for I be not yet ascend to my father joh. 20. 15. which place say they be the centre or middle part of the whole world and the place where Mary and Martha meet Christ sit on a stone and say unto he master if thou have be here my brother have not die also the castle of Lazarus and many such like thing that be so they report which of molehill will make a mountain by their will and with such lie wonder do these lazy friar bring silly stranger into a wonder and admiration and these be the man which every three year be send from Rome to sojourn in jerusalem by fifty or sixty at a time and be royal maintain by the pope and other catholic and when their regiment of three year be expire than other succeed they and they return home and be prefer some to be bishop and some to other office because they have be at the holy city of jerusalem and return from thence as holy as they go thither according to that old verse with a little inversion judeae that be to jury bad man have recourse and go from thence as bad or worse these and many other false and frivolous matter do they show and persuade simple traveller to believe and too many there be which give credit thereunto and publish the same to other for truth it be better for such credulous person to stay at home and learn the truth then to come abroad and believe untrut as many do doubtful thing beside these thing already set down whereof some be true some most untrue other thing there be which they shall do see and hear whereof a man may suspend his judgement whether they be true or false until he either see they or receive further confirmation by read than he can by the affirmation of some few superstitious person of which sort be these follow about a mile distant from the city they bring we to a rockey place where there be a vault under the ground as it be a large porch from whence we enter into other intricate room as it be into a labyrinth by a great door of stone hew out of the same place have neither iron work or timber work about it but in the same place where it grow there it be square and make to turn about by the skilful art of cunning mason and it be of a huge thickness and greatness so soon as we have pass that door we creep very low as it be into a oven mouth every man with a candle in his hand and so come into a dark room four square with bench round about of stone hollow like unto manger and therein they say some of the noble family of the king and queen of Israel and judah be bury from thence they bring we into another room of like sort and for like use and so from one to another that without a guide it be impossible to find the way out how many such room there be I know not but we be in six or seven and they offer to bring we into more but be almost stifle for want of light and air we desire to return I make no qustion but they be place of burial for in the hollow bench of stone we see bone of man but whether they be the sepulchre of the king of Israel and Judah or not be my doubt at the entrance in the temple where the sepulchre be to be see the first thing which they show unto stranger be a fair marble stone even with the ground and there say they the body of our saviour Christ be lay when it be take down from the cross while it be prepare to be lay in the sepulchre and here I see many simple people both man and woman kneel round about that stone wring their hand weep and cry as if they have see the dead body of our saviour Christ there present before their eye and they all to be-kissed that stone yea more than kiss it for some of they rub their lip up and down upon that stone very often until they have rub off the skin and make their lip bleed and some of they rub their bead upon it that some inherent holiness may come out of that stone and rest upon their bead I censure this superstition of they over favourable in number this stone among doubtful thing which I may rather have reckon among manifest untrut for if there have be any such stone it will have be either carry away by piece or remove whole to Rome as other relic have be but this stone be too new to be of any such antiquity at bethania they bring we into a cellar under the ground bethania over which there be no house where Lazarus lie dead when Christ raise he up to life and at bethphage they show we the ruin of Simon the bethphage Phariseis house where Christ sit at dinner mary Magdalene come and pour ointment on his head and wash his foot with her tear and dry they with the hair of her head for although no man deny but that such thing be do yet a man may make doubt whether those be the particular place where they be do in jerusalem they show we porta porta that be the golden gate or place where it stand call in former time the beautiful gate of the temple which the turk have wall up with stone because of a prophecy viz. that the city be once win there and shall be again win at the same place walk betwixt the valley of Gehinnom and the wall of the city our guide show we a dark chapel under the ground without window wherein he tell we the idolatrous jew do offer and sacrifice their child unto a brazen image call moloch which be make hot they enclose they in the hollowness thereof and so slay they and lest their cry shall move any to compassion towards they they make a hideous noise with tabret and drum whereupon the place be call tophet jere. 7. 31. on the top of mount Olivet Sodom they show we thirty mile off the lake of Sodom which unto we appear to be very near and they tell we thereof many strange matter not only that which the wiseman Solomon report of it in his day wisd 10. 7. that it smoke as if hell have there find a chinmey whereout to vent his smoke and that the tree bear fruit that never come to ripeness but further that it neither breed nor preserve any live creature it be common call mare that be the dead sea be so contagious as if a bird but fly over it she be present damp and fall down dead into it and as s. Jerome say if by the swell of jordan the fish but flow over into it they die straight and float above the water yea they further report unto we of their own knowledge have as shey say see the same that it cast out continual filthy vapour by who stinche and breath the mountain and valley many mile about be as it be scorch blast and make utter barren beside many ugly shape and show of terror in it beside apple of goodly colour grow by it which be touch turn all to smoke and ash they also tell we that the pillar of salt whereinto Lot wif^ be turn be yet stand but of these and many other thing which they show we and tell we I make doubt either because I have not see they myself or have see they do not believe they when I shall with my eye behold they I will more bold make report of they and of other matter which offer themselves unto my sight in my return but which way to return we have not yet determine and thus be loath to interrupt your serious domestical affair with foreign and frivolous matter I humble take my leave and leave you to he who never leave his from jerusalem dom. 160^ April 7.
