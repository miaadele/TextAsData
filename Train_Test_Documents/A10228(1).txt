it be determine a special time in sign of the creation of the world. likewise it be ceremonial accord to the allegorical signification in as much as it be a sign of the rest of Christ in the grave which be the seven day and likewise accord to the moral signification as it signify a cease from every act of sin and the rest of the mind in god. likewise accord to the anagogical signification as it prefigure the rest of the fruition of God which shall be in our country to these observation of Thomas we may add that strictness of the observation that they may not kindle a fire on the sabbath and

be sanctify unto spiritual devotion from the begin of the world and that a seven day rest begin not with the mosaical ceremony in the wilderness as some man will have it but with Adam in paradise that

of their signification and event be call the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil which be not evil or hurtful in itself but be a visible rule whereby good and evil shall be know and that by reason of the commandment annex which he may by this precept see to be ground in obey or disobey the authority of the lawgiver a easy rule and yet too easy break for when as God do hereby challenge his own sovereignty by impose so easy a fine which may have forbid all but one as contrariwise he allow and fore-signified the danger that he may continue his goodness to man continue in obedience yet do man herein show his contempt in reject so easy a yoke and so light a burden I will not reason whether these two tree may proper be call sacrament of which say some the one be but for the bodily life and better never to have touch the other this we know that in eat of this he lose both bodily and spiritual life which the name and institution thereof forewarned and shall have preunt

it be the want of original righteousness and a inclination to evil * * gen. 6.5 the imagmation of our heart be only evil continual no grape can grow on these thorn the form of this corruption be the deformity of our corrupt nature not by infusion or imitation but by default of that first instrument by which this nature descend it be the root of actual sin and whereas they as first-fruit be transient this still remain until Christ by his death destroy this death in we but here arise another difficulty how this sin can be derive by generation see it be true believe that God be a a Heb. 12.9 the father of spirit the b b ecc. 12.7 gen. 2.7 zac. 12.1 former of our soul which do by infusion create and by creation infuse they corruptible element be unable to procreate a incorruptible substance or generation to produce incorruption neither stand it with reason that he which communicate not the substance shall communicate the accident or with justice that a innocent soul shall necessary be stain by involuntary infusion into a pollute body I answer hereunto that although the soul be not traduct as they term it and by generation confer yet be it couple to the body in that manner and order which God have appoint for the conjunction thereof though man have not sin neither be it the soul alone in Adam or the body alone but the person consist of both which sind neither can we be partaker of nature sin till we be partaker of humane nature which be not till the soul and body be unite we be not so much therefore to look to the concupiscence and lust of the parent in generation on as c c lib. sent. 2 dist ^ 1 Lombard teach we but to the person which d d scent Scotus say be and and although the soul be not in the seed yet be communicate to the body say Aquinas by a dispositive or preparative power of the seed which dispose and prepare the body to the receive of the soul where it be receive after the e e Vnumquodq general rule accord to the measure and nature of that which receive the father be then a perfect father not because he beget the soul but because he beget the person or at least all whatsoever in the person be beget and though he do not beget the substance thereof yet as it be such a subsistence he may be say to procreate it because his generation work towards the union of the soul and body which union be make by the spirit animal and vital and f f zanch. operib. d. part. 3 these spirit be procreate by the seed and consist of a middle nature as it be betwixt bodily and spiritual so that the production of the soul and incorporate thereof may be count in the middle way between creation and generation and therefore this original corruption do not reach to Christ jesus although he be true man because he be the seed of the woman and do not descend of Adam by generation say Aquinas but be miraculous frame in the womb and of the substance of the virgin by the power of the holy ghost thus have I presume to offer my crude and rude meditation to the wise world about the derivation of original sin which itself be the cause why we can no better see it as darkness hide itself but the whole city of mankind be herewith set on fire it

every where disagree and yet meet in one centre the necessity of religion as for policy although it be before answer yet this may be add that whereas man with all threaten promise punishment reward

be very great in itself that Herod shall have eight year together many workman at work which josephus number for some part of the time ten thousand and a thousand priest yet sustain no doubt some intermission after his time either whole or in part it can not be so great as to have accomplish it whole from the foundation wherein Solomon spend seven year and beside what any of the natural israelite perform in this work he employ a hundred three and fifty thousand and six hundred workman of the stranger or forainer find in the country and whereas the second temple be but half the height of the former perhaps it be true that accord to josephus he perfect it to that height of a hundred and twenty cubit whereof twenty cubit sink down in the settle of the foundation it be build by Herod of white stone five and twenty cubit long eight thick and twelve broad he that will further read the particular let he have recourse to josephus in his fifteen book of antiquity this temple be burn by

to speak of those person who office and function it be to procure and manage those divine and religious affair and first amongst the first hebrew we find no priest name before Abraham time in which Melchizedech be interpret by the most to be Shem the son of Noah father both of this and other nation and master Broughton have write a whole book in confirmation hereof the head of family then exercise the priestly office of teach pray and sacrifice in their own household as we read of 10 10 gen. 18.19 Abraham Isaac y y Genes. 37 and z z gen. 49 ^ jacob after that the first bear of all the tribe of Israel be consecrate to this business when as GOD have destroy the firstborn of Egypt a a exod. 13.2 and 15. and these offer sacrifice b b exod. 24.5 until that the levite be choose in their room c c num. 3.41 GOD turn that prophetical curse of jacob of d d gen. 49.7 scatter they in Israel into a blessing for the instruct of the israelite the cause of this their consecration be because they e e exod. 32.29 in a zeal of God glory have sanctify their hand to this ministry in the blood of the near of their idolatrous kindred that have sin in adore the golden calf now in the three of number where the firstborn of the israelite and the levite be number appear a difficulty which most of the interpreter which I have read of that place have neglect namely that of the israelitish firstborn there be find from a moneth-old upward two and twenty thousand two hundred seventy and three and of the levite but two and twenty thousand so that therefore there must be five shekel a piece pay for the redemption of every of those two hundred seventy and three in surplusage more than the levite whereas yet in the parcel of the leviticall account be find more of the levite then of the israelite as appear the family of the gershonite contain seven thousand and five hundred the kohathite eight thousand six hundred and the family of Merari six thousand and two hundred which be add together amount to two and twenty thousand and three hundred and therefore be seven and twenty more than the israelite to this * * lyra in num. Diony^ Carthus jun. add also in the number of priest Dionysius Carthusianus and junius for the most be whole silent answer that those three hundred over and above the two and twenty thousand be firstborn themselves and therefore in right of the former challenge of the firstborn be the lord already and if it seem as much wonder which author observe not that of two and twenty thousand be but three hundred firstborn * * but one of 74. that their exploit of execute their kindred for idolatry before mention in which sin the firstborn as priest be like to have follow Aaron a chief man of their tribe may answer for i and that cruel edict f f exod. 9 of Pharaoh and their miraculous fruitfulness may make it less strange that both in these levite there be so few firstborn and in the other israelite also with who amongst 603550. man from twenty year old upward there be though reckon but from a month old as be say but 22273. which be little more than one of seven and twenty beside that inequality of the person number this excursion upon this occasion wherein I have find diverse interpretet mute will I hope find pardon with the reader who happy himself may find some better resolution to return to our history GOD have before appoint Aaron to be high priest and his son g g exod. 28 to be priest to who the levite be assign after as we have say as assistant in inferior office of the tabernacle aaron from who be reckon the succession of the high priest in the same office have appoint to he eight holy garment a breastplate a ephod a robe a broider coat a mitre a girdle a plate of gold and linen breech also his son have appoint to they coat and bonnet and girdle and breech which their attire be describe at large exo. 28. josephus write of the stone there mention that that on the priest right shoulder shine forth very bright when GOD be please with their sacrifice as do also those twelve in the breastplate when in the time of war GOD will assist they which cease miraculous to shine two hundred year before his time or as the talmudist say from the build of the second temple the consecration of the priest and rite thereof be mention Exod. 29. the condition require in the high priest as that he shall not have the bodily defect of blindness lament maimednes etc. nor shall uncover his head and many other such like be express leu. 21. his * * 244 office be daily to light the light at the evening and to burn incense at morning and evening and once every sabbath to set the shewbread before the lord to sacrifice and once a year to make reconciliation in the holy place etc. this office they execute till the captivity after which they rule also in the commonwealth and the family of the maccabee obtain temporal and spiritual jurisdiction be both priest and king but the state be usurp by other they also appoint high priest at their pleasure and thus be Annas and Caiphas high priest although Caiphas alone administer the office which be abrogate to Annas the name only remain and thus josephus say that Anna be most happy who have himself be high priest and see all his son in that office whereas in the institution and before the captivity this office continue ordinary with their life which after they enjoy long or short at pleasure of the conqueror next unto the high priest be the priest lineal descend from Eleazar and ithamar the son of Aaron as in number many so in their priestly raiment consecration condition and office much differ from the sorme as appear for their garment Leuitic. 28. their consecration 29. their condition require in they leu. 10.

Moses plain may be see these priestly family be of the house of Eleazar sixteen and of ithamar eight which David by lot distribute into four and twenty order accord to the number of the head of family those four and twenty man chief of those order be to the high priest as Aaron son be unto he in their ministry 1. chronic. 24. and take turn by course in perform of the same as Luke show h h lu. 1.5 in the example of Zachary josephus i i joseph in app. and in testify the same and affirm that in each of these rank be more than five thousand man in his time and in the history of his life say that

almost as absurd as they if I shall dispute against it see in this and most of their brainsick dream the very recitation be sufficient refutation but before we shake hand with the learned writer of

year 1546 both the divine authority of scripture canonical to the apocrypha-booke which the jew receive not nor ever do and have make the vulgar translation t t ses. 4 in and and eat authentical in public lecture disputation preach and exposition that none under any pretence whatsoever shall presume to reject it it be wonder to see how eager that I say not impudent diverse of they have seek to slander the original text and have blame as author thereof in the new testament heretic and in the old Jew cover their malice to we with pretence of the malice of heretic and jew and forget the true rule that it be a shame to belie the devil thus have u u lib. 2.cap.13 Canus and and gregorius de Valentia Sacroboscus and other traduce the jew in this behalf themselves refute by their own which yet

David Kimchi upon the first psalm and es. 26. comment that the wicked shall not rise but in the day of death their soul shall die together with their body and Aben ezra in his exposition of dan. 12. write out of rabbi Higgaon that many shall rise and many not rise but suffer everlasting reproach and expound it thus that the good jew which die in exile shall rise again when the Messiah shall come and shall live as long as the patriarch before the flood and then they shall make merry with the great fish Leviathan and the great bird Ziz and the great ox Behemos k k see cap. 20. of which we shall speak after when this be do they shall die and at the last day shall be raise up again and shall possess eternal life where shall be no eat nor drink but glory etc. jacob l l gen 47.30 desire to be bury in Canaan not in Egypt for three cause say r. Solomon jarchi because he foresee that of the m m exo. 8.17 dust of Egypt shall be make louse second because the israelite which die out of Canaan shall not rise again without much pain of their roll through the deep and hide vault of the earth three lest the egyptian shall make a idol of he for the better understanding hereof let we hear what be say out of the book Tanchum a exposition of the pentateuch concern this subject the patriarch say he desire to be bury in Canaan because they which be there bury shall first rise in the time of the Messiah and r. Hananiah say that they which die out of Canaan must endure two death and the same appear jer. 20. where it be say Pashur shall go into Babel and shall there die and there be bury what quoth r. Simon shall they all the just perish which die out of Canaan no but GOD will make they mechillo that be deep cliff and cave under the earth by which they may pass into the land of promise whither when they be come GOD shall inspire into they the breath of life that they may rise again as it be write n n Ezec. 37.12 I will open your grave and cause yond to come out of your sepulcher etc. the like be write in their or chaldaean interpretation of the canticle when they dead shall rise mount oluiet shall eleave asunder and the israelite which have be dead shall come out of the same and they which have die in strange land come thither by hole under the earth shall come forth and for his cause I myself say our author have hear the jew say that sometime some of the wealthy and devout amongst they go into the land of Canaan that their body may there sleep and so be free from this miserable passage under so many deep sea and rough mountain now to come from their faith to their work their wise rabbin persuade the filly people that they be the only elect people of GOD who easy can keep not the decalogue or ten commandment alone but the whole law of Moses they divide the whole law into six hundred and thirteen commandment and they again into precept and prohibition of the command precept they number two hundred forty and eight just so many as accord to the rabbin anatomy a man have member in his body of the prohibit commandment they reckon three hundred threescore and five as many as be day in the year o o Brandsp or as in the book Brandspiegel vein in a man body therefore if every member of a man do every day perform one of the precept and omit one of the thing prohibit the whole law of Moses shall be every year and so for ever fulfil their wise rabbin say further that the man only be to observe those six hundred and thirteen commandment the woman be only subject to the prohibition yea of those prohibitory mandate only to threescore and four be they oblige by some and to six and thirty of the former and this because of their other householdbusinesse and subjection to their imperious husband some of their deepely-wise rabbin add to those six hundred and thirteen seven other commandment make up the number of six hundred and twenty just so many as be word in the decalogue and as arise of the word Keter signify a crown for be it not for the law GOD will not have create the world and for the observation thereof it yet subsi and they which keep all the commandment do set a crown on the head of GOD and he upon the head of those which crown he shall set seven crown and make they to inherit seven chamber in paradise and will keep they from the seven infernal dungeon because they have obtain the seven heaven and the seven earth their wiseman affirm that every vein of the body of a man do provoke he to omit that which be forbid and he which do omit such their vain veine-warning have no good vein in he every of his member also do provoke he to perform those inssorie invention but as vain shall I be as they if I shall not make some end where they can find none we will now from these generality proceed to the particular of their superstition trace they herein from their birth to their grave religion be in the pretence of their law the square of all their otherwise civil action at least to speak of their superstition in the same but first see Sebestian Munster have write a whole book both in Hebrew and latin of those six hundred and thirteen precept take out of Moses with the exposition of their rabbin I think good to cull out some which

perform and when they make ready that seat for Elias than they be bind in set word to say this seat be for the prophet Elias otherwise as a unbidden guest he come not this seat remain for he three whole day together then when the godfather hold the child in his lap the Mohel take he out of his clout and lay hold on his member and hold the foreskin put back the top thereof and rub the foreskin so to make it have the less sense of pain then he take from the boy the circumcising-knife and say with a loud voice bless be thou oh GOD our lord king of the world which have sanctify we with thy

thy commandment and have command we to succeed into the covenant of our father Abraham to which all the congregation answer as this infant have happy succeed into the covenant of our father Abraham so happy shall he succeed into the possession of the law of Moses into marriage also and other good work then do the Mohel wash his bloody mouth and his hand the godfather rise with he and stand over-against he who take the other cup of wine say a certain prayer and pray also over the infant say oh our GOD GOD of our father strengthen and keep this infant to his father and mother and make that his name in the people of Israel may be name here he first name the child call he Isaac Isaac which be the son of Abraham let his father rejoice in he that have come out of his loin let his

the blood and moisten the child lip three time with that wine hope that accord to the former sentence of the prophet he shall live long in the blood of his circumcision than otherwise he shall David also say l l ps. 105.8 he be mindful of his marvelous act which he have do and of his wonder and the judgement of his mouth etc. then he continue his prayer for the present assembly and that GOD will

Munster esteem it a holy prayer by which miracle may be wrought and therefore use it morning and evening they have another prayer call schmoneesre that be eighteen because it contain so many thanksgiving which they say twice a day and the chief chanter of the synagogue sing it twice by himself they think by this prayer to obtain remission of their sin they must pray it stand so that one

of their ceremony at home after their return at their meal and otherwise and of their evening prayer thus have we see the jewish matin which they chant say another a a of Relig. in the west in a strange wild hallow tune imitate sometime trumpet and one echo to the other and wind up by degree from a soft and silent whisper to the high and loud note that their voice will bear with much variety of gesture kneel they use none no more than do the grecian they burn lamp but for show of devotion or elevation of spirit that yet in jew can I never diseerne for they be reverend in their synagogue as grammar boy be at school when their master be absent in sum their holiness be the very outward work itself be a brainless head and a soulelesse-bodie meanwhile the good wife at home against her husband return sweep the house that nothing may disturb his holy cogitation and lay he a book on the table either the pentateuch of Moses or a book of manner to read therein the space of a hour before he go out of the house about his business this study be require of every devout Jew either in his own house or else in their school or synagogue and be thus come home they lap up their Tephillim in a chest first that of the head then that of the hand they account it healthful also to eat somewhat in the morning before they go to work for whereas there be threescore and three disease of the gall a bit of bread or draught of wine can cure they all about eleven of clock his wife have prepare his dinner pure meat pure dress but if she have pullen or cattle she must first feed they for it be say b b Deut. 11.13 I will give grass in thy field for thy cattle and thou shall eat and be satisfy you see the cattle be first mention and to keep such domestical cattle be good in respect of the disastrous motion of the planet which must some way sort to effect but if they be studious of alm and good work than Saphyra Rabath the great chancellor some angel accord to his office register the same and commend they unto GOD say turn away that planetaire misfortune from such a one for he have do these and these good work and then do it befall some wicked man or else some of the cattle before they come to the table they must make trial again in the privy what they can do for it be write c c 26.10 thou shall carry out the old because of the new especial let there be clean water wherein the household must first wash than the wife and last the good man who present without touch or speak aught else may more pure give thanks he say r. Iose in the d d Talmud tract sotah.c.1 Talmud that eat with unwashen hand be as he that lie with a harlot for it be write e e prou. 6.26 for the strange woman a man come to a morsel of bread they must wash before meat and after so strict that they may not keep on a ring on their finger for fear of some uncleanness remain under it I have rather say r. Akiba die for thirst then neglect this wash tradition of the elder when he have only so much water bring he into prison as may serve he but to one use of wash or drink at his own choice on the table clean spread must be set a whole loaf well bake and the salt and then the householder or the chief rabbi at table take the loaf into his hand and in the clean and best bake part thereof make a cut into it and then set it down and spread his hand on it say bless be thou lord GOD king of the world who bring bread out of the earth and then break off that piece of bread which he have cut before and dip it into the salt or broth eat it without speak a word for if he speak he must say over his grace again after this he take the loaf and cut for the rest then he take a cup of wine if they have any with both hand and with the right hand hold it up a handful high than the table and lock steadfast on the cup say bless etc. who have make the fruit of the vine over water they pronounce no blessing and if there be not three at least at the table each man must bless for himself if three or more the rest say amen salt be religious set on in remembrance of the sacrifice if when they cut they shall cut off the piece of bread it will offend god. both hand they spread over the loaf in memory of the ten commandment which GOD have publish concern wheat of which bread be make the bread must be have in special honour no vessel support with it or set upon it and a f f robin-good-fellow or the spirit of the buttery among the jew spirit call nabel give attendance as depute to observe such as through negligence tread it under foot and to bring they into poverty and another man dog by this spirit which seek to bring he to poverty eat victual one day on the grass in the field the spirit hope to effect his purpose but this devout Jew after he have eat pare away the grass and throw it with the crumb scatter into it into the sea for the fish and present hear a voice say woe be i fool who have attend to punish this man and can have occasion they dream that Elias and every man proper angel attend at table to hear what be say if they talk of the law otherwise a ill angel come and cause brawl and disease and in respect of these spiritual attendant they cast not their bone beside or behind they they be curious not to eat flesh and fish together but first flesh and then scour their tooth from the flesh and eat a bit of bread and drink a draught of drink before they eat the fish they must not use the same knife to meat make of milk which they use in eat flesh milk must not stand on the table with flesh nor touch it beside the 23. psalm set before they in the meal time they testify their devotion by multitude of new grace or thanksgiving if any better wine or dainty be set before they yea beside the particular of their cates even for every good send as of oil rose spice etc. and be of opinion that to use any thing without thanksgiving be to usurp and steal it let this be speak to the shame of many profane Esau with we that will rather sell God blessing for their meat then seek they to their meat although in they the payment of these by tale and not by weight be no better than a bead-superstition they make a religion of leave some leave of their bread on the table but to leave a knife there be dangerous ever since that a Jew once in the rehearse that part of their grace after meat which concern the re-edify of jerusalem in a deep agony take his knife so leave and thrust into his heart this their grace be long contain a commemoration of the benefit vouchsafe their forefather and a prayer for regrant the same to send Elias and the Messiah and that they may not be bring to beg or borrow of the christian and for his blessing upon all of that house etc. whereunto be answer with a loud voice amen and they say to themselves g g psal. 39.10.11 fear the lord you his saint for they that fear he have no want the lion lack and suffer hunger but they which seek the lord shall want nothing that be good and while this be say there must not a crumb i leave in their mouth the prayer must be in that place where they have eat or else they shall loose the benefit of burial and a certain devout jew in the field remember that he have forget his grace return back to the house and there perform his duty have miraculous send unto he a dove of gold in city where be synagogue about five in the afternoon their h h ^uls^^tor among the jew be as our sexton clerk or some such officer go about and with knock at their door give they notice of evening prayer thither be come they sit down and say this prayer of the first word call aschre i i Psal 8 44. and 144.15 and 145.5 bless be they which dwell in thy house praise thou continual selah bless be the people that be thus bless be the people who GOD be the lord I will magnify thou oh GOD my king etc. all that 145. psalm throughout he which say this psalm thrice a day shall have his portion in eternal life then the chief chorister or chanter sing half their prayer call Kaddesch and then all say those eighteen praise mention in morning prayer then go their chorister out of his pulpit and kneel down upon the step before the ark and fall down with his face on his left hand all the people do likewise say oh merciful and gracious GOD I have sin in thy sight but thou be full of mercy be merciful unto i and receive my prayer proceed from a humble heart reprove i not oh lord in thy wrath nor correct i in thine anger and so proceed through that whole 6 psalm his countenance cover and incline to the ground this be do in imitation k k josh. 7.6 of joshua then the preceptor or chief chorister again rise up say and we know not what to do but that we direct our eye unto thou and then they say up the other half of their Kaddesch and so end their evensong now shall they go home and after supper return to perform their night devotion but because a full belly will rather be at rest and may easy forget this duty after some pause and stay they proceed before they go to their other task and in that time of pause between their vesper and nocturne if there be any strife between any and reconciliation can be make than he which can reconcile his neighbour go to the common prayer-book and shut it knock thereon with his hand say any kelao I conclude the business as if he shall say I conclude pray till my adversary be reconcile to i until which thing be effect they may not pray further and so sometime their prayer be intermit then and diverse day together if one party will be stubborn these prayer be for substance much like the former as against the christian and for their own restitution by their Messiah they depart out of the synagogue with repetition of those sentence mention in the former chapter at supper they behave themselves as at dinner go to bed they put off the left shoe before the right their shirt they put off when they be cover in their bed for fear of the wall behold their nakedness he that make water naked in his chamber shall be a poor man and the prayer l l Deut. 6.4 hear Israel must be his last word on his bed and sleep on the same as in psal. 4.5 speak in your heart on your bed and be silent selah if he can by and by sleep he must repeat it till he can and so his sleep shall prove good to he the bed must be pure for how else shall they think on the name of GOD and it must be so place that they must lie with their head to the south their foot towards the north for by this mean they shall be fruitful in male child they have also their chamber-moral instruct of duty betwixt the man and wife unmeet for sober and chaste ear it be time for our pen to sleep with they and end this chapter chap. 17 their weekly observation of time viz.

Brandon in the legend can you refuse he who find he cool himself in the sea sit upon a stone which he have sometime remove out of a place where it be needless into the highway so meritorious even in judas be any the least good work p p like to this be the story of Turnus and r. Akiba in the Ta'mud Tract. sanbed.c.7 there do judas acquaint Brandon with this sunday-refreshing of the hellish prisoner and desire his holy company to scar away the devil when they shall after Sunday evensong come to fetch he again which for that time Brandon grant and perform the jew will not quite empty any place of water that on the sabbath these fiery soul may find where to cool they two angel attend they home from the synagogue one good and the other evil which if they find all thing well that be jewish prepare for the sabbath honour the good angel say it shall be so the next

sabbath-dayes-iourney he must there abide be it in the midst of a wood or wilderness till the sabbath be past they sleep long on the sabbath morning so with their great pleasure to honour it they then use more prayer in their synagogue and read seven lecture of the law. they now also read the prophet they stay here till noon and no long least by long fast and pray they shall break the prophetical commandment r r Easie 58.13 thou shall call my sabbath a delight after dinner also they read in their law for s s Minhagim pag. 13 on a time the sabbath and the law put up their complaint to GOD for want of a companion and learner and the israelite be give as a companion to the sabbath and on the sabbath a learner of the law but for all this they talk not more busy all the week through of usury buy and sell then on their sabbath their evensong they have soon do that they may return and while the day yet last make a end of their three banquet by which they be secure against hell and against gog and Magog they conclude it with blessing and sing till it be late to prolong the return of the soul into hell for present after they have end there be proclamation through hell to recall they to their dungeon in these song they call upon Elias to come so just be they delude who scoff impute unto t t matth. 27.47 CHRIST the call of Elias but their Elias be busy as he sometime say of ahabs Baal and not come than they request he to come the next sabbath but he it seem be loath to leave his place under the tree of life in paradise where he stand say they enrol their good work in the keep of the sabbath when this their devotion be do the woman in haste run to draw water because the fountain of Miriam num. 20. flow into the sea of Tiberias do from thence empty itself in the end of the sabbath into all fountain and be very medicinable after this do the jew make a division between the sabbath and the new week the householder light a great candle call the candle of distinction at who light he view his wall u u this holy wine they sprinkle about their house and themselves as effectual against disease and devil bless a cup of wine and a little silver box full of sweet spice pour a little of the wine on the ground and apply the box to every one nose to smell to thus to remedy the stink which be cause at the new open of hell for the return of the soul or else to keep they from swoon at the departure of one of their soul for they be of opinion that themselves have a superfluous sabbatharie soul which on that day be plentiful send in to they to enlarge their heart and to expel care and sorrow Antonius Margarita affirm that they dream of three soul in each man beside the sabbatharie soul two of which leave he in his sleep one mount to heaven where in learn thing to come the other call brutish contemplate sin and vanity the view of their nail at the candle be in remembrance of Adam nakedness all save where the nail cover his finger and toe end the wine they pour on the ground to refresh Corah and his complice under the ground for their sabbath-worke they be determine rabbinical a horse may have a halter or a bridle to lead but not a saddle to lade he and he that lead he must not let it hang so loose that it may seem he rather carry it then lead the horse a hen may not wear her hose sow about her leg but this mark must on Friday be take off and if any cattle fall into a pit yet may they not help it out on the sabbath so spiteful have their talmudical rabbin endeavour to make where they can not find a falsehood in the 10 10 math. 12.11 word of CHRIST testify the contrary but from the beginning it be not thus the jew may not milk his cattle not eat of the milk when he have procure a christian to milk they except he first buy it but at his own price a tailor may not wear a needle stick on his garment the lame may use a staff the blind may not clog or patten to keep they out of the dirt they may not burden themselves with it be lawful to carry a plaster on their sore but if it fall off they may not lay it on again nor may they bind up a wound anew nor carry money in their purse or garment nor rub their dirty shoe against the ground though they may wipe it off against a wall nor wipe their hand foul with dirt on a towel but with a cow or horse-tail they may do it if a flea bite he may remove but not kill it a louse he may but their doctor disagree in this lousy question for r. Eliezer say one may as well kill a camel he must take heed of leave more corn to fowl that day than they shall eat if it be in a open place lest it may there grow and he be say to sow corn on the sabbath to whistle a tune with his mouth or play it on a instrument be unlawful as also to knock with the ring or hammer of a door and therefore the clerk knock with his hand when he call they to the synagogue to knock on a table to still a child to draw a letter in dust or ash or a moisten table be unlawful in the air not so of these sabbath-labour they have nine and thirty chief article whereto the small as these be refer with much ridiculous nicety as the first article be of till ground wherein be reserve dig fill up ditch etc. and to this go over a fallow rub his dirty shoe on the ground etc. it be time this ditch be now fill and we proceed further chap. 18 the jewish Passeover as they now observe it and other their feast and fast of the jewish feast as they be celebrate before the come of CHRIST we have already speak in these day they blind and stubborne persist in like observation of time though with some variation of ceremony their Talmud reckon four newyear day beside the

fifteen begin their new year for tree in reckon the time of lawfulness to eat or tithe their fruit the a a their order of celebrate the Passeover at this day rich jew prepare thirty day before for their Passover good wheat for their unleavened cake the sabbath before the passever be solemn and sacred wherein they have a sermon concern the paschall lamb two or three day before the Passeover they scour their household implement of wood and mettle with much curiosity and variety of rite for he that in this feast use a impure vessel be as he that have lie by a unclean woman the night before the feast the goodman of the house with a wax candle a dish and wing begin his search for leaven bread and with other man or boy to help he after their amen to his blessing with wax candle in their hand they leave not a mousehole unsearched and hide that bread which they mean to eat that night leave they shall find that and be force to burn it that which they find they curious cover leave some mouse by carry it shall make they havenew work and for this cause sup also in a corner with great care that nothing fall to the ground when he have end his search whatsoever leaven say he be under my hand which I have not see let it be toss to and fro like the dust of the earth in the morning they make their unleavened cake of meal grow three day at least the knead trough must be line with linen lest some of the leaven meal shall cleave thereto the goodman himself must draw the liquor that it be knead with and that at sun set the cake be make with as much scruple round and prick full of hole in a cold place etc. to keep they from leaveue they eat little and the firstborn nothing till night that then they may have the better paschall-stomacke at the evensong they observe muchwhat the same ceremony as at the sabbath they make at home the fair show of their plate and riches and seat themselves on chair as it be of state and account now of themselves as great lord triumph over their late

have also a salad of herb and a saucer of vinegar set on the table then sit they down and every one to the child in the cradle have his cup fill with wine and here with a carouse after a blessing begin the feast with a scrupulous use of these thing mention then follow the supper itself with much riot till midnight with such cheer as they have with diverse ceremony curse their enemy call for Elias pray for the re-edify of the temple use many divine attribute as merciful God great God bountiful God high God fair God sweet God mighty God and God of thiewe now build thy temple short very soon very soon in our day very soon very soon now build now build now build now build now build thy temple quick strong God line God etc. over and over with such battology this night they think themselves secure against man and devil they leave their door open all night to entertain Elias and one to their solace play Elias in a white linen garment each man drink four cup full of the bless wine in regard of four deliverance which the rabbin find in 6. v. 6 7. the ceremony of Moses they be not tie to forsooth because they be not in Canaan in the morning they visit the synagogue with their sabbath-rite they bring two book out of the ark and call forth five man and if this feast be on the sabbath seven to read out of the same nice be their determination what work they may do on this day and what not they may dress no more meat than be this day eat if they beat spice the mortar must lie side-wise for distinction sake of the day etc. fast and weep must be avoid if any farce a hen the needle must be three the day before and the thread must be burn not bite or break asunder in such trifle the school of Schammai license to eat the same day a egg lay on a festival day hillel deny it and betwixt they they have set the rabbin by the care in this and such profane question their evensong have a short dispatch and then the next day they b b reiterate the same ceremony and that for certainty because they doubt of the first day of the month and therefore observe two the four day follow be halfe-holy-daye some work may be do in they and not some and what they do to make a difference must be do otherwise as write crooked etc. and that which can without loss be defer may now be do the seven day they observe in more complcate holiness and the eight too for the reason

with our prayer to GOD at last to take that veil of Moses from their heart that there may be one proper shepherd and one sheepfold and that mean while we may learn precious to esteem and reverent to make use of that light we have warn by the spectacle of divine justice in they through so many eye blind in so palpable foolery we will now leave they and this holy land and seek further what adventure we shall light on in the next neighbour nation hope and crave for pardon of such prolixity in this part of our discourse fit of all the other in this part of our work to be consider chap. 21 of the hope and hindrance of the jew conversion when I have now as I think bring this jewish relation to a end and even weary the reader with that which may much more weary the writer that prophecy of a a rom. 11 25.26 Paul that all Israel shall be save etc. which by most interpreter be construe of the general conversion of that nation after the fullness of the gentile be come in as in the begin of this work be say cause my stray pen ready to wander from these so far wander from their holy progenitor to undertake this task also to declare what future hope and what present fear and let may be conceive of their conversion to Christianity the hope though it be yet toss upon surge of almost-desperate sea yet have a sure anchor to rely on and a kind of obscure ken of that wished-for haven where it will be for b b p. mart. in rom. c. 11 the destruction of the jew say Peter martyr be not so desperate but that there be some hope leave of their salvation and a little after allude to the apostle mystery for when there shall have be a full conversion of the gentile unto CHRIST then shall the jew also come in so chrusostom c c tom. 2 hom. 12. in marc. dom. because the fullness of the gentile have come in at last all Israel shall be save the same hope be general cherish by the rest of the father yet do indeed depend more upon divine goodness then on human probability the stability of his truth which have promise as Paul also rom. 11. expound the former prophet the unchangeableness of God election the bottomless sea of his mercy the unsearchablenesse of his judgement minister hope beyond hope hereunto also may be add the common ground both of reason which they hold with we in nature and of scripture the auncient part whereof and especial the law of Moses they maintain with equal acknowledgement and for the most part with more forward industry and zeal then do the commoner sort of christian but the b b impediment of the jew conversion impediment which have hitherto and do yet withhold they from christianity do exceed in number and power for that forestall prejudice of they the glory of the temple the sacrifice and legal worship past their hope then and still of such a monarch to their Messiah as you have hear of the splendour of their renown ancestor the keep of the divine oracle their peculiar title of be God people have breed in they such a swell pride that they natural envy and abhor the very thought thereof that the gentile shall in these thing either equal or succeed they soon say Martin c c luth. in Mic^ 4.1,2 Luther than they will endure that the gentile which in their daily prayer they curse and revise shall have any part with they in their Messiah and be account coheir thereof they will crucify ten messiah yea if it be possible will do to death GOD himself with all the angel and creature else although they shall therefore undergo a thousand hell hence in a great part proceed their natural and long continue obstinacy and beside that prejudice pride and envy they be not a little scandalize from the christian themselves somewhat in regard of the mutual difference and disagreement among protestant which though in itself bad be make much worse by the unseasonable and unreasonable exaggeration of their common adversary the Papist but more in respect of those which call themselves catholic and be not but even by these man be find to be manifest idolater d d religion of the west part a scandal it be to see God law neglect and man exact with rigour a great matter at some time to eat flesh than the adulterous pollution of the flesh at any time the blasphemy of nation these be interjection to the vulgar and phrase of gallantry to the prince the forge and pack of miracle wherein the friar and jew concur with equal diligence the one in contrive the other in discover they a scandal be the alteration which they be force by the inquisitor to make in their author and monument of antiquity think that these device be our best evidence a scandal be the vow and pray to angel and saint yea more to the mother of CHRIST then to CHRIST himself or to GOD to who alone they repute this a due sacrifice but the great scandal of all other be the worship of image indeed it seem strange to i and do to the rest of my brother accord to the flesh Nathanael a jew bear baptize in London before the congregation at all-hallowes e e Apr. 1577 make this confession even unto this day in who this blindness and hardness of heart be in part continue through occasion give by they that profess the name of JESUS and not only in we which be of the house of Israel but in other as the turk and mahumetan which be of the race of ishmael we and our father and elder say and in our book call they by no other name but buale idolatrous master a thing so detestable unto we as nothing more etc. they say unto we oftentimes that they do not worship they as god but GOD in they neither be the heathen we say that be round about we so blind that they think the stock and stone to be GOD but they be persuade that GOD may be worship in they and yet they go far for the christian in Spain and Portugal have it write in their book that the virgin Marie be the lord treasure and that she bestow gift and grace upon her servant that her mercy pardon they who the justice of her son may condemn and that our salvation lie in her hand but our law teach that GOD be all-sufficient he give to who he list he will not give his glory to another etc. the reader may if he please from that jew himself in his print confession be further inform of that partition-wall which separate the jew and catholic they be so much the more scandalize when they see the catechism recite the Decalogne with omission of that second commandment which they think as one of their great rabbin contest with our f f rel. west author be the ordinance of CHRIST himself yea the priest and friar let pass in their conference with they for currant their jewish upbraid that CHRIST a carpenter son be a image-maker or at least a author of their worship as for those speculative plaster of (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) and (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) of intention instrumental and final in worship of image of the true and idol of the false god they be as even now you hear the unsavoure dregs to the jew in the world the poor idiot among the christian can as little distinguish as the pagan and both amongst the christian be like honour do to God image and to that of saint and to they both in like form of worship as amongst the pagan they be force to be at some sermon and there be well edify by their hear when they see the preacher direct his prayer to a crucifix call it his lord and Savieur their transubstantiation be a monster as hideous as the former the mean g g ibid. use to their conversion be weak especial in some place where they have not the new testament in such language as they can understand and the inquisitor have inhibit and take from they all book write on that theme in defence of christian religion or against it allege they will have no dispute in matter of religion either way like the jesuite edict at Dola forbid all talk of GOD either in good sort or in bad but of all other this be a good furtherance that when in their baptism they deny the devil and all his work they must renounce their right and property in all their good and possession the shameful covetousness of hypocritical christian have bring these within the compass of the devil work presuppose forsooth that either the convert jew or his corrupt ancestor have scrape together such heap of wealth by usury or oppression or some unlawful mean or other therefore for the good of his soul his body shall be leave to beg or starve while with the leave of his jewish superstition he must likewise leave all that he have and his new-received religion must be a mean to strip he of his riches and to wean he from his well-beloved Mammon which that nation be natural so far in love with this alone to the world-bewitched jew be such a partition-wall to keep he from christianity that he will venture soul and all rather than thus betray himself his wife and child to extreme beggary and want especial since the fair of his preferment to welcome he to our religion be to turn friar than which profession nothing can be more hateful to he who account it a course against nature and a breach of that ordinance of h h gen. 1.28 GOD of multiply the world by a holy propagation in that i i Heb. 13.4 honourable estate of marriage which that k k 1. tim. 4.1.4 doctrine of devil have make the friar uncapable of as for the example of Elias and some other holy man who our popish votary will make patroness of their disorderly order the jew herein more truly-christian than the Papist hold it a course extraordinary and ordinary prefer holy marriage far before that seeming-ho vow of virginity thus we see what outward scandale beside their general prejudice against Christianity do hinder they from it which offence in behalf of the christian together with that prejudice pride and envy and above all that veil which divine justice have leave upon their heart GOD in his good time remove and grant accord to that prophecy that all Israel may be save of the arabian saracen turk and of the ancient inhabitant of Asia and of their religion the three book chap. i. of Arabia and of the ancient

threescore and twelve principal which agree with our former number every one account his own to be good and true in which a man may attain salvation and yet Leo there add that in this age there be not find above two g g but two principal faction mahometan at this day one be that of Leshari which in all turkey Arabia and Africa be embrace the other Imamia currant in Persia and Corosan of which in his proper place more so that by Leo judgement all which follow the rule Leshari or be catholic Mahumetans although of these the same author affirm that in cairo and all Egypt be four religion different from each other in spiritual or ecclesiastical ceremony and also in this as concern their civil and canon law all found on the mahometan scripture in time past by four learned man diverse construe the general rule to such particular as seem to they fit for their follower who disagree in opinion agree in affection and converse together without hatred or upbraid each other as for those other sect it seem that they be for the most part long since vanish and those difference which remain consist rather in diversity of rule and order of profession then in differ sect and heresy of religion except in some few which yet remain of which h h 1. l. 3 Leo thus report fourscore year after Mahumet one Abilhaseu give certain rule to his disciple contrary to the alcoran-principle but write nothing about a hundred year after Elharit Ibnu ese of bagaded write a book unto his disciple condemn by the Calipha and Canonists but about fourscore year after that another great clerk revive the same doctrine and have many follower yet he and they be therefore condemn to death but obtain to have trial of his opinion by disputation he overthrow his adversary the mahometan lawyer and the Califa favour the say sect and erected-monastery for they their sect continue till Malicsah of the nation of the turk persecute the same but twenty year after it be again renew and one Elgazzuli a learned man write seven book reconcile these sectary and the lawyer together which reconciliation continue till the come of the tartar and Asia and Africa be full of these reformer of their law in old time none but learned man may be admit professor hereof but within these last hundred year every ignorant idiot profess it say that learning be not necessary but i i what difference herein between the Mahumerane and the separatist the holy spirit do reveal to they which have clean heart the knowledge of the truth these contrary to the Alcoran sing lovesong and dance with some fantastical ecstasy affirm themselves to be ravish of divine love these be great glutton they may not marry but be repute sodomite the same our author write of some which teach that by good work fast and abstinence a man may attain a nature angelical have his mind so purify that he can sin although he will but he must first pass through fifty degree of discipline and although he sin before he be pass these fifty degree yet GOD do not impute it to he these observe strange and inestimable fast at the first after they live in all pleasure of the world their rule be write in four volume by a learned and eloquent man Essehravar and by ibnul-farid another author in exact and most learned verse that the sphere element planet and star be one GOD and that no faith nor law can be erroneous because that all man in their mind intend to worship that which be to be worship and they believe that the knowledge of GOD be contain in one man who be call Elcorb elect and partaker of GOD and in knowledge as god. there be other forty man amongst they call elaut that be * * dunce because of their less knowledge when the Elcorb or Elcoth die his successor be choose out of these and into that vacant place of the forty they choose one out of another number of seventy they have a three inferior number of a hundred threescore and five their title I remember not out of which they choose when any of the threescore and ten die their law or rule enjoin they to wander through the world in manner of fool or of great sinner or of the vile amongst man and under this cloak many be most wicked man go naked without hide their shame and have to deal with woman in the open and common street like beast of this base sort be many in Tunis and far more in Egypt and most of all in cairo I myself say our author in cairo in the street call bain Elcasraim see one of they with my eye take a beautiful dame come out of the bath and lay she down in the midst of the street and carnal know she and present when he have leave the woman all the people run to touch her clothes because a holy man have touch they and they say that this saint seem to do a sin but that he do it not her husband know of it reckon it a rare favour and blessing of GOD and make solemn feast and give alm for that cause but the judge which will have punish he for the same be like to be slay of the rude multitude who have they in great reputation of sanctity and every day give they gift and present there be another sort that may be term caballist which fast strange nor do they eat the flesh of any creature but have certain meat ordain and appoint for every hour of the day and night and certain particular prayer accord to the day and month number their say prayer and use to carry upon they some square thing paint with character and number they affirm that the good spirit appear and acquaint they with the affair of the world a excellent doctor name frame their rule and prayer and how to make their square and it seem to i who have see the work to be more magical than cabalasticall one book show their prayer and fast the second their square the three the virtue of the fourscore and nineteen name of GOD which I see in the hand of a venetian jew at Rome there be another rule in these sect call Sunach of certain hermit which live in wood and solitary place feed on nothing but herb and wild first-fruit and none can particular know their life because of this solitariness thus fair leo. other hermit they have of another sort one be mention by Leo k k lib. 4 who have five hundred horse a hundred thousand sheep two hundred beef and of offering and alm betwixt four and five thousand ducat his same great in Asia and Africa his disciple many and five hundred people dwell with he at his charge to who he enjoin not penance nor any thing but give they certain name of GOD and bid they with the same to pray unto he so many time a day when they have learn this they return home he have a hundred tent for stranger his cattle and family he have four wife beside slave and by they many child sumptuous apparel his fame be such that the king of teleusin be afraid of he and he pay nothing to any such veneration have they towards he repute he a saint Leo say he speak with he and that this eremite show he magicke-booke and he think that this his great estimation do come by false work of the true science so the eremite term magic but these hermit we can so well reckon a sect as a religious order of which sort there be diverse in these mahometan nation as in our ensue discourse shall appear to return therefore to the consideration of the mean use to prevent the variety of sect among they the caliphs seek to remedy these inconvenience by their best policy l l io. bot. ben. about the year of our lord 770. assemble a general counsel of their learned man to consult about a uniformity but they disagree among themselves he choose six man of the most learned and shut they up in a house together with their scripture command they that out of those copy disagree as you have hear they shall choose that shall seem best these reduce the doctrine of Mahomet into six book forbid any on pain of death to speak or write otherwise of their law but because the arabian of subtle and pierce wit which study philosophy in the university of Bagdet Morocco Cordova and other place can not but spy and discern the mad folly of the law so palpable to any reasonable judgement it m m fr. richard. c.13 be therefore ordain that the philosophy lecture shall be take away and in place thereof they shall read the Alcoran provide for all these student of their law their expense out of the public charge and inhibit all further study in philosophy insomuch that they now say our author who himself be a student in that university repute he not a good saracen who be addict to that study this friar Richard mention a other prophet name solemn have in estimation with these babylonian which be after slay by the tartar he and cardinal affirm that the saracen of the east differ in their Alcoran from those of the west make the first five chapter but one and that they differ in the exposition thereof and in the same school or university one sect condemn another but in these time the mahumetane professor be chief distinguish by the several nation of which be four principal the arabian persian turk and tartar to which we may add the Mogore as a five who the jesuite in their epistle report to halt from his former Mahumetisme and to incline to gentilism of all these the arabian be most zealous in their superstition the persian most agree to reason and nature the tartar be more heathenish and simple the turk be the freee and most martial the arabian account it their peculiar glory that Mahumet be of that nation and that Mecca and Medina be there seat and therefore have labour in the day of their former puissance by the sword since by their traffic and preach to spread their Mahumetisme through the world their first seducer have possess Syria and Paleflina Homar have add Egypt and in a short time their successor have prevail in Asia Africa and Europe as we n n sup. c.2 have before show they have be such in arm and in diligence of preach they have be as forward and so continue io. bot. ben. seven hundred year since Perimal reign in malabar they there sow their tare and the more easy to take those ethnike in their net they take their daughter in marriage a matter of much consequence in regard of their wealth and practise of they to this day they be author of great gain unto they by their trade and traffic for spicery and be suffer to inhabit and plant colony amongst they by their mean Calicut of a final thing become a great and rich city and Perimal himself be pervert by they to their faith who zealous incline to their persuasion resolve to end his day at Mecca and put himself on the voyage with some ship of pepper and other thing of price but perish by tempest in the way from malabar they pass to the and Zeilan Somatra java Molucca the philippinaes and in the continent to Cambaia Bengala siam Malucca jor Pam and the huge kingdom of China preach and plant their superstition as in the particular history of these nation shall further appear they be in this respect so zealous that even the arabian mariner will stay behind in the country of the ethnike there to divulge this their sect and in the year 1555. one of they pierce as far as japon there to have lay this leaven but the portugall in these eastern part tread in the same step by their traffic and preach have much hinder their proceed the tartar persian and turk require long and severeall discourse in their due place and first we will speak of they which be first in this rank the great of all mahumetane state the turk they reckon mad man very holy and saint and therefore Vertomannus feign himself mad so escape the furious zeal of the moor and his straight imprisonment but this and many other their superstition we shall find in the Turk and therefore forbear now to report they Damsco sometime as be say be their patriarchal sea and continue famous for the mahumetane superstition long after it be report that in the time of Tamerlane the magnificence of their temple be most admirable have forty great porch in the circuit thereof and within nine thousand lamp hang from the roof all of gold and silver he spare the city at first for the temple and after destroy both it and they as * * libr. 1.cap.15 we have before relate chap. 8 of the turkish nation their original and proceed although some may think that I have be so tedious in the relation of the mahometan opinion and superstition that to speak any thing more will seem but as pour water into a full sea yet because there be in this world nothing certain but uncertainty it be divine prerogative to be yesterday today the same for ever and that this saracenicall religion have sustain her chance and change accord to the diversity of time and place where it be and have be profess so do I hold it fit as we have see the foundation to behold also the frame and fabriques thereon build and from that fountain or sincke-hole rather of superstition to lead you along the gutter and stream thence derive and because the turk be preeminent in all those thing which this profession account eminent it be meet to give they the first place here which else where take it and after we have set down a brief history of that nation and the proceed of their state to describe their theory and opinion and then their practice and rite of religion but before we come to the discovery of their religion it be not amiss to search the beginning and increase of this nation the name of turk signify say shepherd or herdsman and such it seem be their ancient profession as of the rest of the scythian unto this day Nicephorus a a Lir. 18.ca.30 speak of the turk and place they about Bactria their chief city he call taugast which be suppose to be the work of Alexander their religion he say at that time be to worship the fire air water and earth which they adore and sing hymn to they acknowledge GOD the maker of heaven and earth to who they sacrifice horse kine and sheep they have priest which divine of thing to come the prince of Taugast they call the son of GOD they worship image the prince spend the night with seven hundred woman the tartar have now possess the

and mother of the chief of the place and as we have say of the priest so it be to be understand that all the man and woman there do the same without sail in any point they suffer not a Christian to enter therein and yet will they enter into the church of the christian to hear the church-musicke the woman abide in their church from nine of the clock to midnight continual pray with certain motion and strange cry continue so long in this act that they fall upon the ground as in a swoon through weariness and if any feel herself at that time to be with child the turk hold that they be conceive by

howsoever Lucian suit to his scoff yet I have insert as somewhat express their superstition observe in charm and divination leave these magi let we take view of the persian religious rite which c c Herodotus lib. 1 Herodotus thus describe the persian neither erect image nor altar nor temple and impute it to madness in such as do therefore as I think because they be not of the greek opinion that the god have arise from man their custom be ascend up the high hill to offer sacrifice to jupiter call the whole circle of heaven jupiter they sacrifice to the sun and moon and earth to the fire and water and wind to these only have they accustom to sacrifice from the beginning they sacrifice also to Urania which they have learn of the assyrian and arabian the assyrian call Venus Mylitta the arabian alitta the persian their rite in sacrifice be these be to sacrifice they neither set up altar nor kindle fire nor use vestment pipe cake or libament but he which intend to sacrifice place the sacrifice in a clean place call upon that god wear their Tiara d d the attire of the head among the persian as the turban among the turk gird about with myrtle the sacrificer pray not for himself alone but general for all persian and especial for the king. and after that the sacrifice be cut into small piece he strew under the sodden flesh small herb chief trifoly and set the flesh in order thereon the Magus stand by sing e e some hymn of the generation of the god which they hold to be a most effectual enchantment without one of their magi no sacrifice be account lawful after all this the sacrificer use the flesh at his pleasure of all day every man account his own birthday to be most solemn observe and then make great cheer the rich sort than set whole beef camel horse ass bake in a oven or furnace on the table the poor small beast the persian be small eater but in their drink consult of the weighty affair of which they deliberate fast but pronounce sentence after they be well in drink to vomit or make water open be unlawful to they those that be equal salute when they meet each other with a mutual kiss which be fasten on the cheek only if they be of unequal degree they hold themselves the best of all man their neighbour so much better how much near they they dwell they be much addict to venery with both sex next unto martial valour they repute excellent the procreation of many child the king allow annual present to he who have beget most child and therefore they use many woman the child come not in his father sight till he be five year old but live with the woman that if he die before his father shall thence conceive no grief from that time till he be twenty he learn three thing to ride to shoot to speak truth for to lie be with they the most shameful thing the second to be in debt for one fault only no man ought to be punish whatsoever be not mere to be do ought not to be speak a leprous person if he be a citizen may not enter into the city nor have any society with man for this disease be send say they for some offence against the sun if he be a forrenner they banish he out of their region and for the same cause carry into that region white pigeon in a river they neither spit nor make water nor wash but have they in very religious veneration these thing say Herodotus I can affirm of the persian out of my own knowledge that which follow I do not so well know that they bury not their dead body before they be tear of some fowl or dog but I well know that their magi do wrap they up in wax and then bury they these magi differ both from other man and from the egyptian priest in this that these pollute themselves with the death of nothing but their sacrifice but the magi with their own hand kill any thing except a man and a dog yea they esteem it some great exploit if they have kill very many aunt or serpent or other thing which creep or fly thus far Herodotus Strabo e e libr. 11 name Anaitis amanus and Anandatus

report of the persian the persian have neither image nor altar they sacrifice in a high place they think heaven to be jupiter they worship the sun who they call Mithra the moon also and Venus and the fire and the earth and the wind and the water they sacrifice in a clean place and present their sacrifice crown and when as Magus the ruler of this business have divide the flesh in piece to every one they go their way leave no part thereof to the god who say they be satisfy with the soul of their sacrifice some as it be report lie a part of the numble on the fire they sacrifice especial to the

the fire have their head cover with a kind of labeled mitre hang down on both side that the string cover their lip these thing be do in the temple of Anaitis and amanus for there be their temple and there the image of amanus be carry in procession these thing we have see it seem that whereas Herodotus report they have no temple altar nor image and Strabo so often mention their temple and here the altar and image of amanus that in Herodotus day they have none which grow afterward in use as a foreign rite bring in amongst the persian after the macedonian have conquer they or else that there be differ sect among their magi some as these in Cappadocia embrace altar image and temple some refuse some or all of these for otherwise Strabo disagree not only from Herodotus but from himself before

prayer praise or any certain rite they have also idol of felt in the fashion of a man and the same they set on both side of their tent-doore and under they they put a thing of felt fashion like a dug these they account the keeper of their cattle author of their milk and yongstore other they make of silk and do they much honour some place they in a fair chariot cover before the door of their flation and whosoever steal any thing out of that chariot be slay without all pity their captain have one always in the midst of their tent. to these idol they offer the first first-fruit of their milk and the first morsel of their meat and first draught of their drink at meal and when they kill a beast they offer the heart to their idol leave it before he till the morning and then they take and eat it they make a idol also to their chief emperor and offer thereunto with great solemnity as well other creature as horse which none after dare ride on till death they break not a bone of the beast which they kill for meat but burn they with fire they bend themselves to this idol towards the south as to god. they worship the sun light and fire water also and the earth offer thereunto the first of their meat and drink and in the morning before they eat or drink they have no set rite prescribe by law nor do they compel any to deny their religion simple although in some of their custom they be very rigorous thus they martyr Michael duke of Russia because he refuse to do reverence to the image of Cingis can which have be their first emperor and compel they young brother of Andrew duke of Saruogle in Russia to marry his say brother wife accord to their custom after that they have slay her former husband they have certain tradition accord to which they reckon these thing follow to be sin their sin to thrust a knife into the fire or any way to touch the fire with a knife or with their knife to take flesh out of the cauldron or to hew with a hatchet near to the fire for they think that they shall so cut away the head of the fire they account it sin also to lean on the whip wherewith they beat their horse for they ride not with spur also to touch arrow with a whip to take or kill young bird to strike a horse with the rain of their bridle and to break one bone against another likewise to pour out meat milk or any kind of drink upon the ground or to make water within their tabernacle which whosoever do willing be slay but otherwise he must pay a great sum of money to the enchanter to be purify who cause the tabernacle with all thing therein to pass between two

new enterprise they call she the great emperor and bow their knee and pray thereto the sun they say be the moon mother because she have thence her light their sorcery they be give to divination augury sooth-saying witchcraft enchantment and when they receive answer from the devil they attribute the same unto God who they call Itoga and the comanians call he cham that be emperor who they marvellous fear and reverence offer to he many oblation and the first first-fruit of their meat and drink accord to his answer they dispose all thing they believe that all thing be purge by fire therefore when any ambassador prince or other personage whatsoever come unto they they and their gift must pass between two fire to be purify lest peradventure they have practise some witchcraft or have bring some poison or other mischief with they and if fire fall from heaven upon man or beast which there often happen or if they think themselves any way defile or unclean they thus be purify by their enchanter if any be sick a spear be set up in his tent with black feel welt about it and from thenceforth no stranger enter therein their sickness and funeral for none of they which be present at his death may

bec abbot of Mortimer in his voyage into the east country meet with and have it interpret to he by a arabian and we upon his credit which if any think to be insufficient I leave it to his choice and censure that author say that Tamerlan descend of the tartarian emperor and Og his father be lord of sachetay who give to his son Tamerlan which name signify heavenly grace in their tongue his kingdom while he yet live appoint two wise counsellor Odmar and aly to assist he he be well instruct in the arabian learning and a lover of learned man nature have set in his eye such ray of majesty and beauty that man can scarce endure to look on they he wear long hair contrary to the tartarian custom pretend that his mother come of the race of Samson he be strong and have a fair leg whereas Leunclavius say he be call Tamurleng of his lameness his first war be against the Muscovite who he overcome the second against the king of China with like success I mention not his battle in civil war the three against Bajazet the Turk who he captive pass thither by the way of Persia where guines author of the sophian sect a great ginger and account a holy man encourage he with prophecy of his good success this war he make against Bajazet in behalf of the greek emperor and other who the Turk oppress he go private to Constantinople and have sight of the city with all kindness from the emperor he invade Syria and Egypt overthrow the sultan and win cairo destroy Damascus visit and honour jerusalem and the holy sepulchre and grant great privilege thereunto the prince of Lybia and Barbary by their embassage in Egypt acknowledge his sovereignty in his return by Persia he be encounter by guines who bring with he a infinite number of sundry kind of beast which he make tame and by which he teach man as soon as he see Tamerlan he make his prayer towards the heaven for his health and for the religion of the prophet excommunicate the ottoman as enemy to the faithful believer Tamerlan give he fifteen or sixteen thousand r r some say 30000. of his prisoner which he instruct in his opinion and after conquer Persia and so return to samarcand where he have vow to erect a church and hospital with all sumptuous magnificence thence he go to mount Althay to bury his uncle and father in law the great cham in who state he succeed he enrich samarcand with the spoil get in his war and call the temple which he there build the temple of Solomon wherein he hang up trophy and monument of his victory and cause all his battle therein to be engrave thereby say he to acknowledge the goodness of god. his religion be not pure Mahumetisme for he think GOD be delight with variety of worship yet he hate polytheisme and idol only one GOD he acknowledge and that with much devotion after his manner thus he beat down all the idol in China but honour the christian with great admiration at the strict life of some votary when aly his counsellor be dead he build a stately tomb for he at samarcand and cause prayer to be say three day for his soul be near his end he bless his two son lay his hand on the head of Sautochio the elder and press it down but lift up the chin of Letrochio the young as it be presage unto he the empire although the elder be proclaim but this empire be too great and too sudden erect to continue these three sort of tartar which we have hitherto mention be all for the most part Mahumetans there be some yet as Michonius s s lib. 1 cap. 7 affirm near the caspian sea which be not Mahumetans nor shave their hair of their head after the tartarian manner and therefore they call they calmuch or pagan the four be those which in greatness be first namely the cathayans call Carabus that be black-head of their turban as the former jeselbas but of their religion further than that which have be before express we can say little and it seem by the relation mention in the former chapter that they be gentile or christian and not of Mahomet error Chaggi Memet t t Chag a persian merchant relate as in part be say before to ramusius that he have be at Campion Daimir can then reign and that until the westerly part of Tanguth they be idolater and ethnike from thence westward musulmans or saracen in the epistle of u u Carval epist. the jesuite it be report by a mahumetane merchant that they be christian happy because of image which the idolater and pseudo-christians do equal worship the five and last form of our tartar be those which abide in those place whence the tartar first issue to overwhelm all Asia with their army of which be relate at large in the nine chapter of which for want of probable intelligence I can say little more our map place there the horde of the danite Nephthalites Ciremissians turbite and other which some derive from the dispersion as be say of the ten tribe here be tabor also who king be by Charles the five emperor in the year 1540 as before be say burn at Mantua for solicit to judaisme pope innocent king jew of France by mean of will. and the king of Armenia solicit as you have partly hear both the great can and his chief prince to become christian and it be likely that the tartar might if diligence have be use and some superstition have not darken the christian profession have be thereunto persuade which many also of they be as appear in Haithon mat. westmonast and vincentius but the saracen which have before pollute those country where the mahometan tartar now abide by that suitableness of their law to their lawless lust of rapine and polygamy prevail as Michovius 10 10 lib. 1.c.5 report with bathi and those other tartar to embrace Mahumet and refuse CHRIST they say Eissa Rocholla that be JESUS be the spirit of the lord Mahomet Rossolai that be Mahomet be the justice of god. they obey say he the pentateuch of Moses be circumcise observe the legal ceremony they have no bell but every day cry which signify that there be but one god. they profess themselves ismaelite the christian they call Dzintzis that be pagan and gaur infidel y y see the saracen history they observe three feast the first Kuiram to which they prepare themselves with their thirty day lend and in that feast offer ram bird etc. the second they celebrate for all soul for which they fast a month visit the grave and do work of mercy the three they keep for themselves and their own salvation and fast twelve day josafa Barbaro z z l. 1 ram. a venetian which live amongst the tartar about the year 1437 say that they embrace not the faith of Mahomet general but as every man like until about that time in the day of Hedighi a captain under sidahame can who first compel they thereunto be before free unto their idolatry if they please and of the other tartar near the zagathayans he say that many of they be idolater and carry idol in the cart yea some of they use to worship beast they first meet with after they go abroad in the morning their neighbour the moxij at a certain time in the year take a horse which they set in the field with his four leg tie to four post and his head to another post fasten in the ground this do one of they stand in a convenient distance shoot he to the heart afterward they flay he and observe certain ceremony about the flesh eat the same the skin they fill with chaff and in each of his leg thrust a straight stick that he may stand upright as if he be alive last they go to a great tree and lop therefrom as many bough as they think good and make a room or sollar in that tree where they set this horse on this foot and worship he offer unto his fox and diverse beast which bear rich fur of which offering the tree hang full master jenkinson mention a nation live among the tartar call king which be also gentile as be also the Kirgessen of who we have speak and the colmacke which worship the sun as they do also a red cloth fasten to the top of a pole and eat serpent worm and other filth near to which he place in his map of Russia certain statue or pillar of stone which sometime be hoard of man and beast feed transform by divine power if it be not human error into this stony substance retain their pristine shape these nation be either tartar or in manner of life like unto they and may therefore pass under that general appellation and this may suffice touch the tartarian nation and religion which in the west and south part of their abode be mahumetane in the more northerly and easterly partly heathenish partly jewish or moorish or mix or as may best advantage they and most please they wander in opinion in like sort as in their habitation but I have show myself no tartarian while I dwell so long on this tartarian discourse happy herein as tedious to the reader as stay in one place will be to the bohemian-tartar a thing to he so abominable as in anger he wish it as a curse will GOD thou may abide in one place as the christian till thou smell thine own dung indeed this history not thorough handle before by any one draw i along and I hope will purchase pardon to this prolixity chap. 14 of the nation which live in or near to those part now possess by the tartar and their religion and custom from those country inhabit by the persian and zagathayan tartar eastward we can see with m. Paulus his eye the best guide we can get for this way any religion but the saracen till we come to a province somewhat bend to the south the people whereof be idolater and magician cruel and deceitful live on flesh and rice seven day journey from hence be chesmur wicked cunning in their devilish art by which they cause the dumb idol to speak the day to grow dark and other marvelous thing be the wellspring of idol and idolatry in those part they have Heremits after their law which abide in their monastery be very abstinent in eat and drink contain their body in strait chastity and be very careful to abstain from such sin wherewith they think their idol offend and live long there be of they many monastery they be observe of the people with great reverence the people of that nation shed no blood nor kill any flesh but if they will eat any they get the saracen which live amongst they to kill it for they northeastward from hence be Vochan a saracenicall nation and after many day journey over mountain so high that no kind of bird be see thereon be Beloro inhabit with idolater Cascar the next country be mahumetane beyond which be many nestorian christian in Carchan there be also moores or mahumetan which have defile with like superstition the country of Cotam and Peym where the woman may marry new husband if the former be absent above twenty day a a this marriage admit no nonresidence and the man likewise and of Ciarcian and lop. from lordship they cross a desert which ask thirty day and must carry their victual with they here they say spirit call man by their name and cause they to stray from their company and perish with famine when they be pass this desert they enter into Sachion the first city of Tanguth a idolatrous province subject to the great can there be also some nestorian and saracen where they have have the art of print these thousand year they have monastery replenish with idol of diverse sort to which they sacrifice and when they have a male child bear they commend it to some idol in who honour they nourish a ram in their house that year and after on their idol festival they bring it together with their son before the idol and sacrifice the ram and dress the flesh let it stand till they have finish their prayer for their child health in which space they say their idol have suck out the principal substance of the meat which they then carry home to their house and assemble their kinsfolk eat it with great reverence and rejoice save the bone in goodly vessel the priest have for their fee the head foot innards skin and some part of the flesh. when any of great place die they b b funeral observance in Sachion assemble the astrologer and tell the hour of his nativity that they may by their art find a planet fit to the burn of the corpse which sometime in this respect attend this fiery constellation a week a month or half a year in all which time they set before the corpse a table furnish with bread wine and other viand leave they there so long as one may convenient eat they the spirit there present in their opinion refresh himself with the odour of this provision if any evil happen to any of the house the astrologer ascribe it to the angry soul for neglect of his due hour agree to that of his nativity they make many stay by the way wherein they present this depart soul with such cates to hearten it against the body burn they paint many paper make of the bark of tree with picture of man woman horse camel money and raiment which they burn together with the body that the dead may have to serve he in the next world and all this while of burn be the music of the city present play Chamul the next province be idolatrous or heathenish for so we distinguish they from saracens jew and christian which I will be not as guilty of idolatry as the former in so many their forbid rite although these have all and the other part of the scripture whereof those heathen and idolater be utter ignorant here they not only permit but account it a great honour to have their wife and sister at the pleasure of such stranger as they entertain themselves depart the while and suffer all thing to be at their guest will for so be their idol serve who therefore for this hospitality they think will prosper all that they have and when as mangu can forbid they this beastly practice they abstain three year but then send a pitiful embassage to he with request that they may continue their former custom for since they leave it they can not thrive who overcome by their fond importunity grant their request which they with joy accept and do still observe in the same province of Tanguth be Succuir who mountain be clothe with rheubarbe from whence it be by merchant convey through the world Campion be the mother city of

read soft to themselves nor can our author enter amongst they by any mean break this their silence they have wheresoever they go a string about they full of nutshell like the popish bead-roll always they be utter these word GOD thou know expect so many reward as they make such memorial of god. they have a churchyard and a church-porch with a long pole on it as it be a steeple adjoin to their temple in those porch they use to sit and confer they wear certain ornament of paper on their head their writing be downward and so from the left hand to the right which the tartar receive from they they use magical character hang their temple full of they they burn their dead and lay up the ash in the top of a pyramid they believe there be one GOD that he be a spirit and their image they make not to represent GOD but in memorial of the rich after their death as they profess to the priest beside their saffron-iackets button close before wear on their left shoulder a cloak descend before and behind under their right arm like to a deacon carry the houselboxe in lent. they worship towards the north clap their hand together and prostrate themselves on their knee upon the earth hold also their forehead in their hand they extend their temple east and west in length upon the north-side they build as it be a vestry on the south a porch the door of their temple be always open to the south a certain nestorian priest tell he of so huge a idol that may be see two day before a man come at it within the quire which be on the north side of the temple they place a chest long and broad like a table and behind that chest stand their principal idol towards the south round about which they place the other less idol and upon that chest they set candle and oblation they have great bell like

that be the golden old wife to which they offer precious fur and sacrifice heart besmear the mouth and eye of the idol with the blood in the time of their sacrifice the priest demand of the idol touch thing to come and sometime receive answer the samoyed be idolater and witch observe devilish superstition as witness Richard johnson who in the five of january 1557. see amongst they as b b r. johnson Hak. to.1 follow the samoyed about the bank of Pechere be in subjection to the Muscovite and when they will remove from one place to another than they will make sacrifice in manner follow every kindred do sacrifice in their own tent and he that be most ancient be their priest. and first the priest do begin to play upon a thing like to a great five with a skin on the one end like a drum his drumme-sticke be about a span long and one end be round like a ball cover with the skin of a hart. also the priest have as it be a white garland on his head and his face be cover with a piece of a shirt of male with many small rib and tooth of fish and wild beast hang thereon then he sing as we use here in England to hollow whoop or shout at hound and the rest of the company answer he with this oute Igha Igha Igha to which the priest with his voice repli and they answer he with the selfsame word so many time till in the end he become as it be mad fall down as he be dead have nothing on he but a shirt and lie on his back I perceive he yet to breath and ask why he lie so they answer now do our GOD tell he what we shall do and whither we shall go and when he have lie still a little while they cry thus three time together Oghao Oghao Oghao and as they use these three call he rise with his head and lie down again and then he rise up and sing with like voice as he do before with the like answer Igha Igha Igha then he command they to kill five Ollens or great deer and continue sing still both he and they as before then he take a sword of a cubit and a span long I do mete it myself and put it into his belly half way and sometime less but no wound be to be see they continue their sweet song still then he put the sword into the fire till it be warm and so thrust it into the slit of his shirt and thrust it through his body as I think in at his navel and out at his fundament the point be out of his shirt behind I lay my finger upon it then he pull out the sword and sit down this be do they set a kettle of water over the fire to heat and when the water do seethe the priest begin to sing again they answer he for so long as the water be in seethe they sit and sing not then they make a thing be four square and in height and squareness of a chair and cover with a gown very close the forepart thereof for the hinderpart stand to the tent side their tent be round and be call Chome in their language the water still seethe on the fire and this square seat be ready the priest put off his shirt and the thing like a garland which be on his head with those thing which cover his face and he have on yet all this while a pair of hose of deere-skinne with the hair on which come up to his buttock so he go into the square seat and sit down like a tailor and sing with a strong voice or hollow then they take a small line make of deere-skinne of four fathom long and with a small knot the priest make it fast about his neck and under his left arm and give it to two man stand on each side of he which hold the end together then the kettle of hot water be set before he in the square seat which seat they now cover with a gown of broad-cloath without line such as the Russ use to wear then the two man which do hold the end of the line still stand there begin to draw and draw till they have draw the end of the line stiff and together and then I hear a thing fall into the kettle of water which be before he in the tent I ask what it be and they answer his head shoulder and leave arm which the line have cut off I mean the knot which I see afterward draw hard together then I rise up and will have look whether it be so or not but they lay hold on i and say that if they shall see he with their bodily eye they shall live no long and the most part of they can speak the russian tongue to be understand and they take i to be a russian then they begin to hallow with these word oghaoo oghaoo oghaoo many time together in the mean while I see a thing like a finger of a man two time together thrust through the gown from the priest. I ask they that sit near to i what it be that I see and they say not his finger for he be yet dead and that which I see appear through the gown be a beast but what beast they know not nor will not tell and I look upon the gown and there be no hole to be see at last the priest lift up his head with his shoulder and arm and all his body and come out to the fire thus far of their service which I see during the space of certain hour but how they do worship their idol that I see not for they put up their stuff to remove from that place where they lay and I go to he that serve their priest and ask he what their GOD say to he when he lay as dead he answer that his own people do not know neither be it for they to know for they must do as he command the hollander in the year 1594. scent to

itself her own power even by order of nature and proportion of the element can but seem dreadful in which as the air exceed the water and be itself exceed of the fire so the water may seem no less to surmount the earth the low and least of the element and what army of exhalation do the sun daily muster in the great airy plain which will succour their mother in such a attempt beside that even the earth as it be every where compass of the sea do compass in itself so many sea lake Rivers in the uppermost face thereof as profess partaker and the inward bowel thereof have daily intelligence and

the moon be companion in their motion uncertain whether the ocean have a natural power in itself or from the moon so to move but these thing we leave to philosopher search wit and better leisure the motion of the sea be manifold as first by ebb and flow these also differ accord to the course of the moon in spring or nepe-tide and accord to the distance as they be near or further from the ocean and accord to the deepness or shallowness of the place beside other accident overrule they make they in diverse sea to be great less or none at all long also in some place or often as in Negropont where the water be say to rise and fall seven time a day and beside these hourly daily or monthly motion another more general be ascribe unto the sea from east to west proceed from the motion of the

and Egypt be now together with Syria subdue Elcain himself see the Chalipha of Bagdet make no preparation to withstand he by the advice of gehoar which at that time sound cairo pass into Egypt think to invest himself with the saracenicall sovereignty commit the government of Barbary to a prince of the tribe Zanhagia who in this absence of his lord compact with the Chalipha of Bagdet and acknowledge his title in Barbary receive in reward of his treason from that Bagdet prelate the kingdom of Africa Elcain have lose his morsel to snatch at a shadow be in great perplexity what course to take counsellor of his persuade he that he may gather great sum of gold if he will let the arabian have free liberty to pass through Egypt into Africa which though he know that they will so waste it by their spoil as it shall remain unprofitable both to himself and his enemy yet incite by two vehement orator covetousnesand revenge at last he grant and permit all arabian which will pay he ducat a piece free to pass receive their promise that they will become deadly enemy to the rebel of Cairaoan whereupon ten tribe or kindred of the arabian half the people of Arabia and a multitude also out of Arabia as write Ibnu Rachu a famous historian out of who Leo have draw a great part of his african history accept the condition and pass the desert they take Tripoli sack cape and after eight month siege enter into cairaoan fill with blood and empty with spoil all the place where they prevail thus do these kindred of arabian settle themselves in these part and force the province adjacent to tribute and remain lord of Africa till joseph found Morocco who aid the posterity of the rebel against they and break their yoke from the city tributary but Mansor the four king and Chalipha of the sect of Muoachedin begin as be say by elmahels and Abdul Mumen prefer the arabian and induce they to make war upon those their enemy who easy they conquer he also bring all the chief and principal of the arabian into the western kingdom and assign they more noble place for habitation to wit the province of Duccala and Azgar to those of mean condition he appoint Numidia which at first be as it be slave to the numidian but after recover their liberty and obtain the dominion of that part of Numidia assign they every day increase in power those which inhabit Azgara and other place in Mauritania be all bring into servitude for the arabian out of the desert be as fish out of the water Atlas on the one side and the other arabian on the other side suffer they not to pass into the desert and therefore they lay down their pride and apply themselves to husbandry dwell in their tent and pay yearly tribute to the king of Mauritania from which those of Duccala by reason of their multitude be free many arabian remain still in Tunis which after mansor death they take and make themselves lord of the region adjoin where some of they bare great sway till Leo time the other deprive of their

ample reward of their great man neither can the neatness and grace of their verse easy be express when they go to war they carry their wife with they on camel and that to make up the wonder to encourage they the arabian between Barbary and Egypt lead a wretched life in those barren desert force not only to exchange their cattle for corn but to pawn their son in great number to the sicilian

such a relic they o o Vincent ferrer a popish saint tell also a tale I think of the queen of Saba that in her journey homeward she have a revelation concern a piece of wood which she see that it shall

first fling up part of every thing into the air and after turn to he to give he the other part offer in their arm to carry he into their house and do else whatsoever he will have they and if any stranger come they will go and meet he to cause he to lay down his weapon and if he will not they will break they in piece he give the chief of they small ware they need not pray they to help draw the

the subversion of this state and kingdom by the spaniard I hold it not amiss to look back unto the first people which here inhabit with the beginning and proceed of the mexican empire the a a Botero part ^^ first inhabitant of new Spain be very barbarous and savage which ^^^ed only by hunt and for this reason be call Chieh^^^^^ a a Ies acosta l. 7 lop gom part. 1. they live naked solitary in the mountain without tillage policy or any religious ceremony their wife follow the same hunt exercise leave their child tie in a Panier of reed to the bough of some tree they do eat what they get in hunt raw they eat also snake and lizard which they offer likewise in sacrifice to the sun who only they worship and that without any image they offer to he fowl from the butterfly to the eagle and some remnant of the like beastly man be yet find which do great hurt and will not by either cunning or force of the spaniard be reduce to any other course they seem to have learn the savage nature of the wild beast of who and with who they live by this mean it come to pass that this wild mountainous people leave the best and most fertile part of the country unpeople which certain remote nation possess who they call b b b b b Navatalcas signify wellspeaker Navatalcas for their civility these come from those northern part which now they call new Mexico the Navatalcas paint their beginning and first territory in manner of cave because of their seven tribe and man come out of they by the supputation of their book this departure be above eight hundred year since and by reduce to our account about the year of our lord 720. fourscore year they stay on the way the cause whereof they ascribe to their god which speak visible to they and bid they seek new land that have such sign as they notify thus they proceed in seek those sign and people the best part still remove their habitation as they find more fertile country leave only the age sick and weary with a few other to remain in the former and by these leisurely proceed they enter the land of Mexico about the year 902 after our account those seven nation come not all at once but first the Suchimilcos next the Chalcas and three the tepanetans four those of Tescuco after they the tlalluicans the 6 be the tlascaltecans which help the spaniard to conquer Mexico and therefore be exempt from tribute to this day these expel as their history say certain giant who in pretence of friendship they have invite to a banquet and in their drunkenness steal away their weapon and slay they neither do this seem a fable for at this day be find dead man bone of incredible bigness I see a tooth say acosta at Mexico in the year 1586 as big as the fist of a man and accord to this all the rest be proportionable three hundred and two year after the first transmigration those of the seven cave or line arrive which be the mexican nation they worship the idol Vitzliputzli and the devil speak and govern this nation he promise to make they lord over all which the other six nation possess and to give they a land plentiful in riches whereupon they go forth carry their idol with they in a coffer of reed support by four of their principal priest with who he talk and communicate his oracle and direction he likewise give they law and teach they the ceremony and sacrifice they shall observe and even as the pillar of cloud and fire conduct the israelite in their passage through the wilderness so this apish devil give they notice when to advance forward and when to stay the first thing they do wheresoever they come be to build a house or tabernacle for their Vitzliputzli which they set always in the midst of their camp and there place the ark in the midst of the altar this do they sow the land and if their god command to gather they do so and if to raise their camp they obey leave the age tick and weary to gather the first-fruit and to dwell there the chief captain who they follow be call Moxi whence come the name of their c c Mexico and mexicans city and nation their idol persuade they when some be bathe themselves in certain lake to remove the camp close and steal away their clothes whereat they which be thus forsake change their language and manner of life retain always their hatred to the mexicans they people the province Mechovacan from hence to Mexico be fifty league and upon the way be Malinalco which they say be people by a witch and her family who by the commandment of their god they leave behind close remove the army by night they stay in a place call where by stop a river they drown a plain and plant it round with willow and other tree and many like the place talk of stay there whereat their god offend threaten the priest and in the night slay those which have consult of stay their heart be find pull out and their stomach open which after that they observe in their sacrifice the mexicans by the advice of their idol proceed and by force make way through the Chalcas and send to the lord of Culhuacan who grant they the place of Ticaapan to dwell in which be full of snake and venomous beast which by the help of their god they tame he will not suffer they to stay there but command they to proceed and to seek forth a woman who they shall name the goddess of discord whereupon they send to the king of Culhuacan to demand his daughter to be queen of the mexicans and mother of their god who easy condescend and send his daughter gorgeous attire the same night she arrive by order of their god she be murder and flay and a young man be cover with her skin with her apparel thereon and be place near the idol be consecrate a goddess and mother of their god ever after worship the same make a idol which they call toccy that be our grandmother the king of Culhuacan hereupon war against they and chase they out of those part by which mean they come to the place where Mexico now be here certain old priest or sorcerer enter into a place full of water-lily they meet with a very fair and clear current of water with tree meadow fish and other thing all very white which be the sign their god have give they of their promise land. in the night follow Vitzliputzli appear in a dream to a ancient priest say that they shall go seek out a tunal in the lake which grow out of a stone upon which they shall see a eagle feed on small bird which they shall hold for the place where their city shall be build to become famous through the world hereupon the next day they all assemble and divide themselves into band make that search with great diligence and devotion in their search they meet with the former watercourse not white as it be then but read like blood divide itself into two stream one of which be a obscure azure at last they espy the eagle with wing display towards the sun compass about with many rich feather of diverse colour and hold in his talon a goodly bird at this sight they fall on their knee and worship the eagle with great demonstration of joy and thanks to Vitzliputzli for this cause they call the city which there they found d d Mexico tenoxtiltan tenoxtiltan which signify tunal on a stone and to this day carry in their arm a eagle upon a tunal with a bird in his talon the next day follow by common consent they make a hermitage adjoin to the tunal of the eagle that the ark of their god may rest there till they may have mean to build he a sumptuous temple this they make of flag and turf cover with straw afterward they consult to buy of their neighbour stone timber lime in exchange of fish fowl frog and other thing which they hunt for in the lake by which mean they procure necessary build a chapel of lime and stone and labour to fill up part of the lake with rubbish the idol command that they shall divide themselves into four principal quarter about this house and each part build therein to which he enjoin certain god of his appointment call Calpultetco which be quarter-god this be the beginning of Mexico this division seem not equal to some of the ancient who value their desert far above their allot portion who therefore separate themselves and go to Tlatedulco who practice against the mexicans cause they to choose a king to which sovereignty be choose Acamapitzli nephew to the king of Culhuacan and of the mexican blood by the father side he by embassage they demand and obtain in the name of their god with this answer from the king of Culhuacan let my grandchild go to serve your god and be his lieutenant to rule and govern his creature by who we live who be the lord of night day and wind let he go and be lord of the water and land and possess the mexican nation etc. he be solemn welcome by the mexicans welcome they art say a e e many of these oration be express in acosta seven book at large full of witty invention and rhetorical flourish orator unto he in their name to this poor house and city amongst these weed and mud where thy poor father grandfather and kinsfolk endure what it please the lord of thing create remember lord thou come to be our defence and to be the resemblance of our Vitzliputzli not to rest thyself but to endure a new charge with many word of that effect express in the mexican history reserve by tradition the child to that end learn they by heart and these be as precedent to they which learn the art oratory after this they be swear and he crown the crown be like that of the duke of Venice his name Acamapixtli signify a handful of reed and therefore they carry in their armoury a hand hold many arrow of reed the mexicans at this time be tributary to the tapanccans who chief city be Azcapuzalco who judge accord to the nature of envy and suspicion that they be so much weak how much the strong they see their neighbour think to oppress they by a strange policy in impose a uncouth and in show impossible tribute which be that they shall bring the Tapunecan king a garden plant and grow in the water in this their distress Vitzliputzli teach they to do it by cast earth upon reed and grass lay in the lake and plant in this move garden Maiz fig gourd and other thing which at the time appoint they carry grow and ripe a thing often since prove in that lake emulous no less of that glory to be account one of the wonder in that new world than those pencil garden tower up in the air at Babylon both here and there the reason of man accord to his natural privilege subject to his use the most rebellious element of air and water Acamapixtli the mexican king after he have reign forty year die leave it to their choice to choose his successor they choose his son Vitzilovitli which

reply that he be then naught which will make they afraid but the fear of Aygnan make they sometime flexible to embrace the christian religion hear that this devil be inferior to the christian god. so

therefore leave the deceivable religion of your false gods. this preach of the friar may well seem strange to Atabaliba which it seem he learn of the mahometans and not of the apostle he answer that he be free and will not become tributary to any nor do acknowledge any great lord than himself and for the emperor he can be please to be the friend of so great a prince and to know he but for the pope he will not obey he which give away that which be not his own and take a kingdom from he who he have never see as for religion he like well his own and neither will nor ought to call it in

pa.1 ca. 72 that in the valley of Pachacama neither the high element yield rain nor the low any stream and yet there be plenty of root Maiz and first-fruit they have large and deep ditch in which they sow or set and that which grow be nourish with the dew and because the Maiz will not grow except it first die they set one or two pilchard head which fish they take with their net very plentiful in

clear and bright the other obscure and as it be a grey veil spread underneath which cover all the coast and although it rain not yet this mist be wonderful profitable to bring forth grass and to raise up and nourish the seed and where they have plenty of water which they draw from the pool and lake yet if this moisture fail there follow great defect of grain and which be more worthy of admiration the dry and barren sand in some place as in the sandy mountain near the city de Loy be by this dew beautify with grass and flower insome place they water their field out of the river beyond the city of cusco the two ridge of mountain separate themselves and in the midst leave a plain and large champain which they call the province of callao where there be many river and great store of fertile pasture there f f accost ibi.c.16 Cieza p. 1.c.103 be also the great lake of which contain four score league in compass and rob ten or twelve great river of their water which they be carry to the sea but here be drink up by the way of this lake they sail in it with ship and bark the water be not altogether sour nor salt as that of the sea but be so thick that it can not be drink upon the bank of this lake be habitation as good as any in Peru. the great lake pass by a river into a less lake call Aulagas from whence it have no manner of passage except there be any under the earth there be many other lake in the mountain which seem to arise rather from spring then from raines or snowes and some of they yield Rivers at the end of the valley of Tarapaya near to Potozi there be a round lake who water be very hot and yet the country be very cold they bathe themselves near the bank for further in it be intolerable in the midst be a boil above twenty foot square it never increase nor decrease although they have draw from it a great stream for mettall-mill but to return from this plenty of water in lake to that want thereof in the plain of Peru. the natural reason which some yield of this want of rain be partly their sandy and dry quality which of themselves can yield no further exhalation then to produce those mist or dew partly the height of the hill which shadow the plain and suffer no wind to blow from the land upon they but intercept they whole with their vapour and cloud so that their wind be only from the sea which find no opposite do not press nor strain forth the vapour which rise to engender rain this seem the rather to be probable for that it rain upon some small hill along the coast which be least shadow in the same coast also where the easterly or northerly wind be ordinary it rain as in Guayaquill the south wind in other place be g g cit a^. ovid. account a causer of rain which here reign without rain as strange be the difference of season after the indian account for in the h h Cieza c. 59 their summer begin in April and end with September October begin their winter which not the absence but the presence of the sun do cause contrariwise in the plain just by in site they have their summer from October to April the rest their winter the reins in the hill be cause why they call it winter and the dew or mist in the plain so that when the reins fall most in the hill it be clear weather in the plain and when the dew fall in the plain it be clear on the hill and thus it come to pass that a man may travel from winter to summer in one day have winter to wash he in the morning and ere night a clear and dry summer to scorch he about the point of St. Helena in Peru they i i Cieza c.25 tell that sometime there live giant of huge stature which come

they will present make answer and there will the father point to the child go a viracochie to reconcile these two whole be impossible not so to show some reason why the same name may be give both to their idol and the spaniard these may be so term as come thither at first by sea and haply because at the first they think somewhat more than human to be in they and that which at first they give for

that time command that Viracocha shall be hold for universal lord and that the image of the sun and thunder shall do he reverence and from that time they set his image high yet do he not dedicate any

the patient reader chap. 12 of their supputation of time of the feast sepulcher and other peruvian superstition before we speak of the peruvian festival time it be not amiss to take some more general view of their calendar they a a acosta libr. 6.^a.3 divide their year into so many day just as we do and into so many month or moon to make the computation of their place certain they use this industry upon the mountain about cusco there be twelve pillar set in order and in such distance as every month one of these pillar do note the rise and set of the sun they call they Saccanga by mean whereof they teach and show the feast and the season fit to sow and reap and for other thing they do certain sacrifice to these pillar of the sun every month have his peculiar name and feast they sometime begin the year in januarie but since a Ingua call Pachacuto which signify a reformer of the temple begin their year in December by reason as it seem of the sun return from Capricorn their near tropic I read not of any week they observe for which they have not so certain a rule as the sun course be for the year and the moon for the month they observe in Peru two kind of feast some ordinary which fall our in certain month of the year and other extraordinary which be for certain cause of importance every month of the year they make feast and sacrifice and have this alike the offering of a hundred sheep but of unlike colour and form accord to the month in the first month they make their first and principal feast therefore call capacrayme that be to say a rich and principal feast in it they offer a great number of sheep and lamb in sacrifice and burn they with sweet wood then they cause gold and silver to be bring upon certain sheep set upon they three image of the sun and three of the thunder the father the son and the brother in these feast they dedicate the b b knight of Peru. Inguas child put the guaras or ensign upon they and they pierce their ear then some old man do whip they with sling and anoint their face with blood in sign that they shall be true knight to the Ingus no stranger may remain in cusco during this month and this feast but at the end thereof they enter and be make partaker of the feast and sacrifice after this manner c c acosta libr. 5 ca. 23 the Mamacomas or nun of the sun make little loaf of the flower of Maiz die and mingle with the blood of white sheep which they do sacrifice that day then they command that all stranger shall enter who set themselves in a certain order and the priest which be of a certain lineage descend from d d Arite resemble the christian communion in a devilish apishness give to every one a morsel of these small loaf say that they give it they to the end they shall be unite and confederate with the Ingua and that they advise they not to speak or think any evil against the Ingua but always to bear he good affection for that this piece shall be a witness of their intention and if they do not as they ought will discover they they carry these small loaf in great platter of gold and silver appoint for that purpose and all do receive and eat those piece thank the sun and the Ingua this manner of communicate they use likewise in the ten month call coyarayme which be September in the feast call Cytua they likewise send of these loaf to all the guaca of the realm whither the people assemble to receive they to who they say that the sun have send they that in sign that he will have they honour he and the cacique this continue from the time of Ingua Yupangui who we may call the perovian Num^ till the spaniard substitute in place thereof their mass a mass of * * powder traitor more monstrous absurdity in their transubstantiation bread-worshipping god-eating which they can also use to combine subject not to their or lawful prince but against they as our powlder-traitour do then the former notwithstanding the fair pretext of christian and catholic title but to return to our capacrayme it be strange that the devil have not only bring in a apish imitation of christian sacrament but of the trinity also in their pagan rite for the father son and brother call Apomt^ Churunti and that be father sun son sun brother sun have some show of that great mystery in like manner they name the three image of the Chuquilla or God of the air whence be thunder reins and snow they have one Guaca where they worship a idol call Tangatanga which they say be one in three and three in one thus do the devil despite the truth which he will seem to imitate in the second month call Camey beside the sacrifice which they make they cast the ash into the river follow five or six league after pray it to carry they into the sea for that the Viracocha shall there receive this present in the three four and five month they offer a hundred sheep black speckle and grey with many other thing in the 6 month they offer a hundred sheep more of all colour and then make a feast bring Maiz from the field into the house which they yet use this feast be make come from the farm to the house say certain song and pray that the Maiz may long continue they put a quantity of the Maiz the best that grow in their farm in a thing which they call Pirua with certain ceremony watch three night then do they put it in the rich garment they have and be thus wrap and dress they worship this Pirua hold it in great veneration and say it be the mother of the Maiz of their inheritance and that by this mean the Maiz augment and be preserve in this month they make a particular sacrifice and the witch demand of this Pirua if it have strength enough to continue until the next year and if it answer no than they carry this Maiz to the farm whence it be take to burn and make a other as before and this foolish vanity still continue in the seven month they make the feast Intiraym^ and sacrifice a hundred guanaco in honour of the sun ^ they make many image of quinva-wood carve all attire with rich garment they dance and cast flower in the high way and thither come the indian paint and sing in the eight month they burn a hundred sheep all grey of the colour of Viscacha with the former solemnity in their nine month they burn a hundred sheep of chesnut colour and likewise a thousand cuye a kind of rabbit to the end the frost air water and sun shall not hurt their farm in the ten month call Coyarami they burn a hundred white sheep that have fleece and then they make the feast Sitna in this manner they assemble together the first day of the moon before the rise thereof carry torch in their hand and when they see it they cry aloud say d d they which do this be call Panco^co^ let all harm go away strike one another with their torch which be do they go to the common bath to the river and fountain and every one to his own bath set themselves to drink four day together in this month also the Mamacomas make their loaf as be say of communicate with the sun and the Ingua the bath drunkenness and some relic of this feast Sitna remain still with the ceremony a little different but very secret in the eleven month they offer also their hundred sheep and if they want water to procure rain they set a black sheep tie in the midst of a plain pour much Chica about it and give it nothing to eat till it rain this e e accost libr.4.ca.16 Chica what it be Chica be a drink or wine make of Maiz sleep and boil and will soon make one drink then wine of grape they have a other way to make it by champ the Maiz which they hold then best when it be do after the beastly manner by old wither woman this drunken people will spend whole day and night in drink it and it be therefore forbid by the law but what law can prevail against the devil and the drunkard we need not go to Peru to prove this the twelve and last month they sacrifice a hundred sheep and solemnize the feast call Raymacantar in this month they prepare what be necessary for the child that shall be make novice the month follow the old man make a certain show together with the child in round and turn which they common do when it rain too much or too little and in the time of plague among the extraordinary feast which be many the most famous be that which they call Ytu this have no time prefix but by necessity or distress and then the people prepare themselves thereto by fast two day during which they do neither company with their wife nor eat any meat with salt or garlic nor drink any Chica all do assemble together in one place where no stranger nor any beast may be admit they have garment and ornament which serve only for this feast they march very quiet f f procession in procession their head cover with their veil sound of drum without speak one to a other this continue a day and a night the day follow they dance and make good cheer for two day and two night together say that their prayer be accept even still they use one which be somewhat like this call Ayma with garment only serve to that end and make procession with their drum have fast before conclude with good cheer and although the indian forbear sacrifice because of the spaniard yet they use many ceremony still which have their beginning from their ancient superstition now concern their funeral the indian g g accost l.5.ca.7 of Peru believe common that the soul live after this life and that the good be in glory and the bad in pain they use a wonderful care h h funeral to preserve the body which they honour after death their successor give they garment and make sacrifice to they especial of the Inguas of who we have speak before in their bloody funeral the woman he love best be slay and multitude of other attendant of all sort for his new family in the other world and that after many song and drunkenness they sacrifice to they many thing especial young child and with the blood they make a stroke on the dead man face from one ear to the other this cruelty be common through a great part of the east and west indies as in their place this history do show you witty avoid once by a Portugal i i witty escape who be a captive and to be slay at the funeral of his lord and have but one eye see better to save his life then if he have have both for he tell they that such a deform and maim fellow will be a disgrace to his master in the other life and so persuade the executor or executioner if you will to seek a new choice the indian have another ceremony more general which be to set meat and drink upon the grave of the dead imagine they do feed thereon at this day many indian infidel do secret draw their dead out of the churchyard and bury they on hill or upon passage of mountain or else in their own house they have also use to put gold and silver in their mouth hand and bosom and to apparel they with new garment durable and well line they believe that the soul of the dead wander up and down endure cold thirst hunger and travel and for this cause they use their anniverssary carry they clothes meat and drink Pedro de Cieza k k Cieza pa. 1.ca.62 report that in in the province of cartagena which we here mention for proximity of rite rather than of place near to a temple build in honour of the devil there be take forth a innumerable quantity of sepulcher more than a million of they old and new himself be there present much treasure be find in the grave juan de la torre take forth of one sepulchre l l rich sepulcher more than five hundred thousand peso the great man adorn their sepulcher with vault and tower and have with they inter their woman servant meat chicha arm and ornament he add that the devil in the shape of some principal person decease will sometime appear and show they news out of that other world how he live and fare there and hence it seem come that spoil of so much wealth and so many person for their funeral but take heed reader that you do not believe it be the devil that be wont to appear in some habit of afflict soul and demand dirge and mass for their manumission out of purgatory alas the devil be confine to the indies and will never have be so good a purveyor for the pope kitchen and certes if our christian ancestor have not their wife and good bury in their grave with food raiment and ornament yet these thing be also bury with they while the fear of purgatory make they willing to endow the priest and monastery and bestow on light and other rite that which shall have maintain their house their wife and child but how come we from Peru to Rome nay how come Rome if not from Peru as more late discover yet with Peru and with and from other heathen nation in the world in her manifold ceremony and superstitious rite as this relation of Peru for their

these image they make of Gossampine cotton hard stop sit like the picture of the devil which they call Zemes who they take to be the mediator and messenger of the great God which they acknowledge one eternal infinite omnipotent invisible of these they think they obtain rain or fair weather and when they go to the war they have certain little one which they bind to their forehead every king have his particular Zemes which he honour they call the eternal GOD by these two name jocauna and Gua^^aonocon as their predecessor teach they affirm that he have a father call by these five name Attaberra
