ECCLES. 8.2 I advertise thou to take heed to the mouth of the king and the word of the oath of God the writer of these word be Solomon the wise and most peaceable governor that ever be in Israel the time be in his ancient year when after long experience of both good and evil he see and say what be befit every state and place the occasion it seem be the flight and revolt of and his complice the coherence be apparent how from the commendation of true wisdom in the first verse he derive this wise advertisement in the second which he prove in the six follow and in the nine verse conclude his own and his equal misery when a ruler who love and care deserve love reap nought but hate and hurt of his own people his purpose be he suppose himself a lawful king as be ordain of God appoint of David and admit of Israel and thereupon require a reverend estimation of his worth and word and that upon their oath then swear to God on his behalf the text be diverse read of diverse interpreter the vulgar latin which the foremost english follow read but this be unlikely for be a king he will not observe the king the late english in the church bible read absolute keep the king commandment without mention of the first person mention in the original the late english infer it with a verb which junius and tremellius express with a possessive all sound in one sense as if he shall have say obey not i only as I be a man for he be the wise man but as a king nor only while I be a king but my successor whosoever shall be king after i nor only so but as a public preacher say Solomon for so the book be entitle I will persuade every subject of every kingdom to take heed unto that be obey their king man must not only be (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) lover of their person but (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) lover of their place nor only so but with Isocrates (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) lover of their successor (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) for child shall inherit as the fortune so the friendship of their parent unto this

look (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) which Pagnin expound either a cause this be the ground of that or a custom which have be long and be often use in Israel or as our translation have the particular i. the word of the oath of God i. that godly oath whereby they be bind to their sovereign this holy scripture concern we asmuch as they we have a Solomon which without comparison be wise peaceable and sanctify his experience as great have reign as long a while over as great a people as Israel his occasion urgent by reason of those english fugitive which have whet their wit tongue pen and sword against his throne his love and care as much as appear in his proceed his purpose but the promise of our love trust and loyalty the mean a oath approve of God and accustom in all country and therefore our miserable vanity shall be worse if we despise he or his oath of allegiance this be the thesis at this time to be determine wherein although the greatness of the cause and the smallness of my experience the multitude of adversary and the general satisfaction have be give already by the Solomon and zadocke the king and bishop of this land may either dis-burden or dishearten my attempt yet the conscience of the truth the liberty of our church the peace of our commonwealth the safeguard of our sovereign the command of authority the joint profession of civil and canonical obedience it be the first and chief canon we shall maintain our prince right against all traitor and heretic will add spirit unto the most unworthy man or mind to speak in that which for these thousand year have be the quarrel of all Christendom give i leave therefore I beseech you be a young divine to deal in statute and state-affair as far as I can prove they consonant unto scripture to follow those illustrious light of the gospel which have write before in this argument as a candle sometime serve in absence of the sun and to speak aswell for our every-way-worthy king out of the word as the canonist and jesuite do for their both creature and creator their pope holiness beside the word of God and then as plain brief and pithy as I can I will deliver the divine lawfulness of the late statute-oath of allegiance this holy scripture enjoin a observation and yield reason in this observation we may consider who and how we shall observe in this our duty and in that the kingly power be declare the kingly power to ground that first which be the ground and scope of all the rest be ordain of God as appear by nature and scripture nature show a heaven to rule this earth the sun to rule the day the moon the night our soul to rule our body and our head by sense and motion to rule all the rest of our member even the crane bee and stork acknowledge their superior in their order and obedience there be nothing so necessary profitable and beautiful in the sight of God angel and honest man in ourselves in a house in the world or heaven as this good order be it be necessary for with it every state be quiet and without it every thing be confound it be profitable by the peace honour and safety which it bring to they which rule and they which can obey it be beautiful for beauty be but a proportion and agreement of one part with another thus it be excellent in ourselves for as in our body our member be direct by the sense sense by reason and reason by the lord so in the politic body of our common wealth the mean sort must be rule by the magistrate the magistrate must be rule and ordain of the prince as the prince be of God it be excellent in a house when man and wife child and servant know their place and perform their duty for then thy servant be like subject thy child like noble thy wife a privy counsellor and thyself as king to determine all controversy it be likewise excellent in the world where the base creature serve the better the better serve man and all indifferent serve one God it be more excellent in heaven whereas the sun rule among the rest of the planet which be direct stationall and retrograde as he come near or go further from they as the planet rule among the rest of the star as have strong influence fair light more sphere and motion as the star by signification of time and disposition of weather rule all element under heaven so may we say the king be over the judge both civil and ecclesiastical the judge over inferior officer and those officer be to compose the commons in good order yet be it more excellent in the heaven of heaven wherein there be angel archangel and several sort of immaculate and immortal spirit every one in their kind behold the face and do the will of God our common father which be in heaven like so many courtier and honourable attendant about a prince but it be most excellent in God himself in who there be no difference of nature yet a distinction of order there be no division of part yet a relation of number there be no inequality of person yet the first be as one fountain from which the second and three proceed to show that though the nature of mankind be like and equal in many common gift yet there may be many respect why some be before other and one before all the rest if then we will rule ourselves or be ruler in our own family if we will enjoy the creature of this world as we hope to be like angel or to renew the likeness of God himself in we we must imitate these example (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) say Aristotle (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) that which be divine better and more ancient be also more honourable now the monarchy be the first policy for when our first parent have beget many child he become a king his experience be their arbiter his blessing their honour his curse their cross and heavy punishment as long as he live which be very near the flood it be unnatural for his offspring to strive with he for any preeminence thus Noah be unto the second world and his child in their several travail ' to their several posterity till the ruler authority grow tyranny and the people liberty turn into licentiousness till the crafty mighty get the weak and rude to their service and all thing be confuse as among Pharaoh kine the worse eat up the better without care and conscience as among the fish the less be devour of the great without any respect of humanity how detestable be the sin before the flood when they be careless eat and drink every one do what they listen and take they wife where they lust how miserable be the confusion in the build of Babel when every one command but none follow how abominable be it when there be no ruler in Israel but every one do that which be good in his own eye even such and so much worse as our estate be weak in these late day will be the manner of mankind be there not some can rule who other will obey thus the want of kingly power show it good and a good the more general it be it be the better whereas many take part it grow particular and so weaken as a river cut in many stream many head have many thought and many fault and therefore Homer say (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) etc. one bear rule the rest will better meet and live and love as one otherwise as in a body when the soul be go there be diverse humour every one strive who shall soon be sever and thereby bring the body to confusion such be a country without one ruler every one seek his proper good and leave the public either impair or dishonour as a flock without a shepherd as a ship without a pilot as other creature without man so man will grow wild and unwieldy without such a overseer for this cause the gentile call they god which gather and govern civil society together whereas aristocracy seem the device of Pythagoras which imagine many principle and Democracie to be the proportion of Epicurus which will have infinite and irregular beginning the monarch be divine as only represent god own power as the moon offer the sunbeam with pleasure to man eye which hardly can be look upon in his own beauty so the monarchy present the wisdom power and justice of the high which otherwise can be look upon in his own glory for none have see God and live as then the child of Israel when they dare not hear the lord but will have Moses to speak to they take this condition also that they shall obey Moses as God himself so since man be so weak and timorous they dare not have angel much less the lord himself immediate to govern they yet it be that they must obey the lord lieutenant as if he speak himself for it be not he but God authority by which he rule this the scripture often teach we where wisdom say by i king reign and tyrant also do possess the world good king be god image and evil prince be his executioner ashur be his rod Nabuchodonosor his servant Cyrus his anoint attila call himself his scourge and Tamberlan his wrath and therefore although God use they as a father do his rod first correct his child by they and then throw they into the fire prepare for they yet the son and saint of God shall submit themselves under his instrument of correction not so much like a dog run at the stone that be throw at he bite the chain that hold he i. repine at the tyrant whereby God restrain he but look high unto the chief cause of his trouble God anger which punish and then lower unto the great motive of God anger their own sin which deserve it if we thus think of evil prince what must we think of good doubtless it be god only majesty which appoint his justice which direct his power which enable they in this high call God have give diverse gift unto diverse man in some wisdom to rule in some willingness to be rule God in his word have set forth every man office and duty God have bless it with success in every state and degree God in his own people Israel have set forth a example how man shall behave themselves in this business it be the lord which appoint Moses joshua David and his posterity to rule over Israel it be the lord which move the people heart to receive honour and obey they for as every beam from the sun and every branch from the root in like sort every power do proceed from God thus by nature and scripture king have rule over subject and therefore subject by the condition of relative must be rule by they thus saint Peter bid we fear God and honour the king all therefore that hold of s. Peter shall be thus counsel thus God Christ and christian have honour they God call they god Christ name they (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) either in as have do or in as be able to do much good unto their people justin say unto the governor we worship God alone in spirit but in outward thing we glad do you service answer the proconsul all such honour as be not contrary to religion we may nay we must yield our emperor the christian of the first five hundred year do some reverence as be manifest by the cunning imposture of julian to their image and since bear themselves lowly to the chair of State a simple officer be heed if he bring but the king name a judge because he take his person a messenger because he bear his arm to show the honour that we owe unto themselves ester tremble at the countenance of Assuerus Israel hear the judgement of Solomon as if it be the wisdom of the lord people shout out at Herod oration it be the voice of God not man this it may be be exceed flattery yet it may show the mean which be with all awfulness to take heed unto the look or word of our sovereign that by practise our duty towards they we may better learn to do they unto God himself their place afford more experience their office more occasion their mean more ability to be do good God have give special gift unto those he set in government as Homer call they (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) like to God more excellent unto those he do advance over his choose as unto Saul David and Zorobabel he give his judgement unto the king and his righteousness unto the king son that he may help the wrong unto right and defend the poor a divine sentence be in the mouth of the king and his mouth transgress not in judgement and therefore we shall rather heed his law or word then our private humour or self-conceited affection since they be place over we not for their ease as what more careful than a crown it be (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) a science of all science to rule a man the most variable of all creature but for the common good it behoove we to serve they say s. Peter as we will serve the Lord thus in general have we see that observation which be due to king let we now take heed unto the ground of this the word of the oath of God wherein we may consider the form it be a oath of God the matter be the word wherein it be conceive for a formal difference it be call the oath of God because every oath be not of God our saviour and saint james have forbid all swear that be all swear by the creature whether heaven or earth gift or altar temple or jerusalem because this kind of swear be against God ourselves and the condition of a oath against God for therein we shall attribute his attribute omni-science almightiness and the just revenge of perjury to the creature which glory God will give to none other against ourselves for man common swear by great than themselves so that hereby we make the creature which be inferior to be better than mankind it be against the nature of a oath for every formal oath be a invocation and a imprecation a invocation of witness and a imprecation of punishment if it be false which neither can be grant of the creature nor expect of the swearer our saviour and saint james forbid all false vainglorious and offensive swear in our customary communication these be not oath of God nor of good but of evil a oath of God be make according to his word and jeremy say it must have three condition truth judgement and righteousness it must be solemn undertake with due judgement it must be certain the better to assure the hearer of a unknown truth it must be righteous to determine right from wrong and be thus it be command in the law thou shall fear the lord thy god thou shall serve he and swear by his name it be prophesy in esay that those of the new covenant of the gospel shall swear by the name of GOD it be promise a reward if they will learn the way of my people to swear by my name they shall be build up in the midst of my people those which with reverence perform this duty shall be edify in faith and advance in God kingdom a oath be a law of nation which GOD never abolish a part of the divine worship for therein we confess he and as GOD hear our oath he know our heart as he discern in his wisdom he will discover in his justice and in his judgement punish our double deal such a oath be a mean of help in all human uncertainty for general doctrine as the schoolman say may be confirm by general conclusion but particular occurrence must have particular confirmation such confirmation can come from any sensible creature which know not what be truth nor from any man for every man be easy to be deceive and so ready to deceive it can come from angel for Satan may transform himself into a angel of light it must therefore only come from God alone who be call upon as a witness will either certify the matter or punish the forswearer let we therefore take with we the condition of jeremy we may well undertake a oath God often swear unto the patriarch the patriarch often swear as appear in genesis a angel swear in the revelation a oath be often use of the faithful as in equal covenant between Abraham and Abimeleck in legal vow as the nazarite in judicial plead as in the case of borrow good be endamage this be use of brother in their bargain as between jacob and Esau of captain in their confederacy as of judas and Nicanor of servant to their master as Moses make a oath to jethro to stay with he thus prince often swear unto their subject as the prince of the congregation do unto the gibeonite that they shall live Solomon swear to Adoniah that he shall not be slay for his rebellion every king when he take his crown undertake a oath why shall not subject also swear unto their prince such be this oath here mention of Solomon for otherwise it agree neither to the former clause where he bid we observe the king nor to the late where he forbid all resist he the word be not particular recite but the sense be plain it require obedience and forbid resistance thus prince oft exact a oath of their inferior for performance of their duty as joshua do of achan that he shall confess his fault ezra swear the priest and levite and all Israel to do according to his word Caiphas adjure Christ he shall confess whether he be the son of God or no our kingly prophet and preacher take a oath of Shimei that he shall not take a journey beyond jordan and it may be well command all his people upon their oath to keep their faith to he against his enemy thus magistrate may well demand and subject render oath now whether this of allegiance be such a one or no shall be manifest in discuss it this oath of allegiance be in some part affirmative in some negative the affirmative be either assertory for the present or promissory for the time to come the first proposition be assertory profess that our sovereign JAMES be lawful king and promissory be those part wherein the swearer tender faith defence and the disclose all conspiracy the negative part concern the pope or the swearer in the pope he deny the superintendence of his authority and the violence of his excommunication in himself he renounce the benefit of absolution and the purpose of equivocation this we may call the mouth of the king because our bless sovereign indict it and yet the oath of God as it proceed from his wisdom and be consonant with his most holy word which will appear in proof of the particular if the pope the cardinal his chaplain or the foule-mouthd exile will have name any thing that have be unallowable they may have save we a labour but since they do not because they can we must maintain it all in every part for the first assertory proposition of our sovereign lawful right I can never have imagine that it will ever have be question but that will have advance their title Clemens with his brief will have bar every Protestant I shame to speak it count he for no catholic and so no christian and so not of the church much less over it in jurisdiction but our most gracious king have so sound convince all such imputation and have prove his and our faith to be so conformable to the scripture that the gate of hell shall never prevail over it God have so bless his rightful claim with good success and just applause of his own and other country that the brief come far too short and perish by their own deliverance to the fire whither otherwise they will have deliver we Doleman I remit unto the report of his own brother and the secular of his religion which better know as just hate and set he out for worse than this place or present be to be make acquaint with for our sovereign without ambition or flattery let i say thus much if succession can make lawful this godly branch be lineal derive from the bless loin of english king which for eight hundred year have sway the sceptre of this commonwealth if institution from God can make a king what great proof hereof can be than his many deliverance before his easy and happy passage then and his hopeful issue to continue this for ever beside the special gift which be only fit for such a majesty that be bestow on he in his religion the confirmation of our gospel in his experience which ever since his cradle have already reign in a more trouble some estate the maintenance of our peace be most infallible promise but his learning be most admirable in a prince of such employment by his meditation on the psalm his detestation of witch and the kingly blessing that he give his princely son wherein he discourse so divine for the scripture so religious for the church so prudent for the commonwealth so careful for his court and so judicious for other exercise we may well know that he know how to govern a kingdom those although some rail Rabshakeh will attribute unto some other yet his grave sound and sufficient composition of the scandalous faction and opinion of our clergy his everywhere skilful moderate in our university disputation his most excellent oration often make unto the parliament may satisfy the most envious and testify to the most incredulous the greatness of his worth beyond all these be the never-inough praise apology wherein with such plainness he deliver his deep knowledge with such mildness he meet with his adversary and yet with such acuteness and abundance of read he confute and retort all their assertion or argument especial the premonition which none but a prince of equal spirit and power dare undertake wherein he so royal defend the common cause of king so severe censure the censurer so plain do he declare his right profess his faith discover Antichrist and expound the revelation and with such love persuade to christian courage and unity that it effectual demonstrate he a prince not only philosophical which Plato think a blessedness but prophetical which the scripture count divine his quick insight beyond the reach of his privy council as appear in discover the powder-blow his justice mingle with mercy which those that seek his life yet live can testify his deep wisdom in devise this just oath well witness he not only wise than ethan and heman Chalcol and the cunning and most learned of our adversary but one for his grace and perfection worthy to rule the world what man or mind therefore can be so base wicked or perverse which either can find or find will not confess or confess will not rejoice in this our happiness in enjoy he what subject shall not promise and perform all civil faith our adversary very wrongful rack this oath to spiritual obedience for albeit in their own saying they can make mountain of molehill by their mental reservation yet according to saint a adjuration be to be take as the judge require it expound himself and this be no more than divine shall be yield unto prince thus saint Paul admonish Titus he shall admonish all they shall be subject and obedient unto power and principality saint Peter will we to be subject unto all manner of human ordinance whether unto the king as to the superior or to the governor that be send of he where I can but wonder at the corrupt exposition of the jesuite which will have (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) to be a ordinance from man as if it be from his devise notwithstanding saint Paul have say all power proceed from God whereas it be indeed a ordinance for man or god order man as he do his other creature in their place and duty like to this be that where they say that (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) signify we must not obey the king unless he shall excel in virtue or otherwise when as the same apostle immediate after bid we to submit with fear not only to the courteous but also to the froward to which Irenaus also consent say some prince be appoint for profit and some for punishment all fit for those over who they rule and to be take as appoint of the Lord thus the martyr do submit themselves unto their persecutor as Ignatius be in prison counsel his antiechians thus the christian soldier do unto julian. thus the counsel do unto their emperor by who help and authority they come together and confirm their decree thus the church the more primitive it be it be the pure from disloyalty not because as our adversary have imagine it want power for a little faith will have remove mountain if it have be expedient for Christianity because it want pride and herein will imitate her master Christ which may have have many legion of angel yet have rather yield unto the civil sword of the magistrate it be a novel doctrine therefore arise up among the jesuite to say be very slave unto their subject contrary even common reason by confound the difference of those relative and pervert the truth of God it be not thus in Persia when the second squire of Darius body say the king rule all all thing be do at his command warfare tillage tribute kill spare plant waste all depend on his pleasure it be not so with joshua to who the reubenite gadite and half the tribe of Manasse say whosoever shall resist thy will or will not obey whatsoever thou command let he be do to death it be not thus at any time in Israel for whether the king be faithful or ungodly the people ever yield civil faith Samuel when he shall first anoint a king he tell the manner of a tyrant that he will make his people and their child slave not because a king shall be so but because if he be so we shall rather suffer then resist if the centurion bid the soldier come they come or go they go do this or that and they do it and shall our general in all cause be less honour than a centurion the jew be bid pray for the peace of Babylon with the life of Nabuchadnetzar and of Balthasar his son and shall we cease to pray for king and those that be in authority that we way lead a quiet life under they without all question we must be faithful in thought word and work cur not the king no not in thy thought speak not evil of the ruler of thy people but rather pray for he as Daniel for Darius though he put he in the lion den by this obedience likewise must we be ready say saint Paul to every good work and sometime thou must leave thy own undo to do the business of thy sovereign such be the faith we shall perform unto which we must also join defence this be as manifest in scripture the wise holy and mighty king of Israel have a special guard of Cherethites and Pelethites which will never have be grant of god own people unto man after god own heart unless the like may have the like it be a honour unto judah that notwithstanding the treachery of sheba yet they stand fast unto their king from jordan to Jerusalem the worthy of David be also count by their three and their thirty as they stand more or less for he in like manner they be not unworthy most honour of our sovereign which have stand most in his defence like to David be he worth many thousand and therefore if any danger shall happen he shall be keep far from the reach of it this be religion to defend the defender of the faith why shall not all defend he who defend all his sword cut off thief and murderer that we may keep our good and body in safety his law curb adulterer that we may keep our wife and daughter in chastity his navy on sea and force on land maintain our quiet and security in he as in the Palladium or purple hair of Nisus consist the safeguard of our common weal as the king of Syria say fight neither against small nor great but only against the king of Israel so the pope which have persecute we ever since Wickliff with fire and sword now fight not against small nor great but have cast all his quarrel upon our sovereign and therefore both small and great must fight for he far be it then from english heart for to be like the man of belial who despise Saul as if he can not save they but we must be like those who heart the lord have touch for to stand with and follow he not like accurse meroz which will not help which will not help the lord against the mighty but like to Zabulon or Nepthalim who jeopard their life to death with Barak and Deborah not like to joab who for his private quarrel will make David naked of his friend but rather like Abishai which expose his own body to peril preserve the life of his dear prince for as a serpent will defend his head and a man his heart because therein lie the lifeblood of their body so shall every subject their sovereign be as josiah be the breath of their nostril and the blessing of their state as Codrus do for Athens or Curtius for the roman or if I may compare as Christ our saviour for his truth so shall every man even with his own life redeem the life of his king on who so many life depend even death be pleasant and honourable in such a cause let we then be valiant for our prince our city and the service of our god and let the lord do that which be good in his own eye so shall we promise and perform defence and thereon follow the disclose all conspiracy which be a part of true defence for otherwise he that conceal seem to consent who can hide fire in his bosom and not be burn who can conceal a mischief and be guiltless he that forbid not such a sin favour if not further it and it be not only those that sin but those that favour sin that shall be punish in God judgement when jezabel shall be cast into the bed of pain her lover also shall suffer great affliction if Bigthan and Teresh then intend evil against Assuerus it be for Mardochaeus a honourable servitor to disclose it if the king of aram even in his privy chamber work mischief against the king of Israel it be for Elizaeus to reveal it if Absalon or Adoniah stir up rebellion against David or Solomon it be for zadock and Abiathar the priest and Nathan the prophet with all speed possible to prevent it it be the trick of a dalilah not to disclose a danger till the philistine be upon we but Michol will discover it even against her own father while there be time to fly beware then of jacobs curse who say of his own child when they become brother in evil into their secret let not my soul enter let not my honour be join unto their assembly so grievous be their crime he think it a sin to know they and a shame to come among they it be a prince glory to prefer his country before his child much more be it in private man to say with our friend or kindred may be dear but our king and commonwealth must be dear as a good pilot then descry the tempest and give warning discover treason before thou be discover as a party for otherwise either the bird of the air say Solomon may utter the voice or the stone in the street say Christ will cry out the truth or thy own mouth may condemn thou like judas who can not hold from say master be it i. this may persuade the lay party but the priest in their auricular confession usurp great authority in this they will their will be all the reason they can yield be like to God himself to see suffer and coverall but let they know their power be not alike to permit sinner for a season and then punish they on a sudden their wisdom be not like to turn and use the worst unto the best purpose their justice be not like the long they suffer sin they can send the sore punishment at last their providence be not alike the more the Christian shall endure to recompense their patience with more pleasure and therefore their proceed in in give penance must not be like their presumption be rather like to Lucifer when he say I will be like the high and therefore their punishment will not be much unlike I but the seal of that holy sacrament shall not be cancel on so sleight a occasion be that a sacrament which have neither instrument nor institution in holy scripture be that a seal which have no seal of God holy spirit can that be count holy which have be pollute with such and so many monstrous abomination as ancient and modern history be stuff with be the ruin of a kingdom but a sleight occasion to break the promise of such a priest be that religion either conscionable or charitable which give covert unto such traitor be not their christian liberty nay their pontifical authority make here the cloak of maliciousness and rank villainy be not their profession the mystery of iniquity they will never keep iniquity so sacred in secrecy that it shall never be disclose Ezekiel be command to dig through the wall jeremy to discover the skirt esay to walk naked the prophet to lift up their voice like trumpet to tell jacob her sin and Israel her transgression but now silence and sufferance not only tolerate but promote the most barbarous project and practice Christ command we what we hear in the ear we shall preach on the house top to tell our brother their fault in private if they mend not we must call witness if that serve not we must accuse they before the congregation and shall the shameless life and credit of a traitor be prefer before the word of (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) before a prince life and the life of many thousand that be innocent a physician if he find a infection be to publish it lest it spread abroad the levitical priest be to denounce a leprous man unclean the poet can mark a perilous person with a black coal and shall the minister of the lord behold a fire in his neighbour his master his own house for the commonwealth be a common household of we all and further it with his concealment that it may burn the sore with a sudden flame the absurdity hence ensue move the friar to discover the traitorous purpose of the noble man of Normandy the jacobin to manifest the treasonable resolution of Barierius and garnet to confess that the law be just be make against concealment and that he be guilty in break they and this I hope sufficient to dissuade all true catholic from the conceal of all conspiracy have thus lay the affirmative part for a groundwork the negative ensue as a corollary the first that be deny be the pope usurp authority that neither of himself nor from the sea of Rome or other man or mean he can depose king dispose kingdom discharge subject authorize alien or license any to bear arm that he can of himself be manifest no man can come to such honour but he that be call of God and God call none except his only son to sit so near his throne much less the pope of who it be experimental note of wise traveller that the worst christian be in Italy the worst italian be the roman the worst of the roman be make priest the worst priest be make cardinal and the worst cardinal be choose to be pope among the late pope be a good prince but no good prelate as appear when he strain this to that by excommunicate her late majesty sixtus Quintus be a good prelate but no good prince much less good man for Bellarmine tell a popish doctor of our nation as far as I can learn he go to hell Gregory the thirteen be a good prince and prelate but no good man for it be a position receive among the jesuite that or man that be no Christian may be pope of Rome Clemens be a good man for a pope a good prince and a prelate for his own hierarchy though not for we but Paulus that now reign be none of those as be manifest in his proceed against our king and church in so much as blackwell which will have die for the prelacy yet be ashamed of his tyranny and say he want a good counsellor thus much less a the seat of Rome have no such privilege for though their faith be famous over all the word the faith of Ephesus be know to God yet it be now fall to Mahumetisme though the council of chalcedon decree (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) etc. because that city rule then it shall have some prerogative yet the council of Carthage have determine (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) etc. that the bishop of the primate sea shall not be call the ruler of the priest the truth be Rome have always be ambitious even while the wall be building Romulus kill his brother that he may reign alone and till this time it continue like itself so true do they verify the rule of their grand master Machiavelli that in the same place as there have be there will be peculiar like affection Rome as in her beginning it be the pattern of all moral virtue so in the begin of christianity she be the prime-example of true patience there the tyrant dwell which persecute the church and those most which be near they of the roman bishop therefore we may rather learn to suffer then to rule the world now as the first even so the second Rome be degenerate into worse manner the first bishop be persecute then acquaint then equal then advance over earthly king first they will be call bishop then than primate than prince than God deputy than god themselves it be not then their power but their policy that have bring they to this pass as before their garrison and soldier win they empire so now their college be their fortress the cardinal their general the friar their soldier the pen their weapon the secular and jesuit their agent and instrument which overcome the world although they get much by their warfare yet their christian cunning peace have get more to their dominion as a prophet of their own foretell and teach like the snake Rome have be warm in the bosom of our great kingdom till it sting they unto death like ivy so long it have embrace that it have eat up whole monarchy like the crocodile by weep and creep it have get into the best estate like old Rome it use all religion only for a vantage he set king at odds and then become a arbiter he bring kingdom to the balance and make that weighty where he do propend as the roman emperor will be count monarch of the world although their empire in Scipio judgement be but a point and under trajan when it flourish most it be not the thirty part so the pope will be take for governor of the world though that there be but a little cantle of Europe which will hold of they thus you see that it be the city custom not the church right which make they thus usurp for there be no other no not saint Peter that can yield it they saint Peter they say be call a rock therefore on saint Peter chair must the church be build to which we say that as Simon be call Peter i. a rock so Peter be call Simon i obedient to show that they shall build so that they may still obey nay being both Simon and Peter he be after call Satan to show the succession of that name will after prove satanical but Peter have the key of the kingdom of heaven which may loose or bind the kingdom of heaven we confess be open by s. Peter key the preach of the word but the kingdom of this earth be yet reserve in the power of God promotion come not either from east or west from north or south but it be God that set up one and pull down another but Peter be bid feed the lamb and sheep why feed be not fleece chief of the flock Peter be bid kill and eat such kill be the conversion not the confusion the mortify not the murder of the gentile it be not the kill sword but prick word which win Cornelius and 3000. at one sermon I but Peter by walk on the sea do get a dominion from sea to sea and from the flood unto the world end no more say we than Christ that flee thither and walk there because he will not be make a king but Christ come into s. Peter ship to show that he will come into s. Peter sea yet as he come in he come out again as he desire Christ for to depart from he for he be a sinful man to show that he will part from they when as they part from his truth yet Peter be foretell his death and bid follow to show that as he follow in suffer he shall follow in reign but all this be no more than he say unto james and John of the cup and baptism they shall be baptize with no more than he tell his other disciple when he bid they take up his cross and follow promise they that leave all for he shall sit upon twelve seat and judge the twelve tribe of Israel who notwithstanding have no judgement in this world if they say s. Peter pay for Christ we may say the fish pay it he if how Christ be first see of Cephas then of the twelve marry Magdalen see he before Cephas if how s. Peter speak the first and most unto the jew of Christ we must answer it be because he speak last and worst when he blaspheme he these be the prerogative of s. Peter whereon Bellarmine will build the pope patrimony but how absurd you may see by that untempered mortar with which he daub the church-government a monarchy say Bellarmine be the best and to this we grant the best monarch even Christ alone as the father establish he I have set my king upon my holy hill of Zion all thing according to s. Paul happen unto the jew in a figure say Bellarmine and therefore our high priesthood must resemble they to which we must answer saint Paul mean all thing that be there mention for otherwise all their ceremony be to become christian the church indeed as Bellarmine say be a kingdom but Christ be the king to who all power be give in heaven and earth a flock but Christ be that good shepherd a body but Christ be the head a ship which the bless apostle can not guide in the tempest until our saviour come and still the wave God forbid I shall here condemn all metropolitan and diocaesan for I know there be certain ecclesiastical reserve case in which they may determine but a universal infinite and incontrollable jurisdiction over man angel devil and purgatory soul can be but Luciferian unto which our adversary compare it and anti-christian how can the pope take on he to direct all truth and salve all mischief in this world unless he pull Christ office from his hand can any man effectual call and send order of minister but Christ which enable we unto this call can any determine all controversy but the spirit that lead into all truth any make one faith but one Christ in who we trust can any govern well all the world but he must be more than a man for a man can hardly govern his own family more than a angel for angel be proportion unto several province in daniel prophesy he must be equal in justice power and wisdom to God himself who take no more in charge than the pope challenge saint Paul have a care indeed of all church but it be of all that be convert then far few than be now to be direct it be in writing pray preach travel which the pope have little leisure to meddle with it be for edify not destruction as they now intend be destitute of scripture they fly to their own decretal whereof some be so plain forge some full of so plain falsehood the residue so much partial that we may say with Christ he that speak of himself seek his own glory and if I bear witness of myself my witness be not true saint Peter do refer the choice of a apostle to the disciple the council of jerusalem prefer he before the rest he call himself but (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) a fellow elder saint Paul withstand he to his face as be in place and deed such as may and shall be blame cyprian say all the apostle have the fame fellowship of honour and office unto which also Hierome consent Pelagius the second and gregory the first will not be call universal and thus it be till phocas the murderer of his master make Boniface the three pope of priest it be not then from saint Peter much less from Christ Christ will have no difference among the bless apostle nor have they reign as king of the nation he bid the priest give to Caesar the thing that be Caesar and as good give they nothing as not obedience Christ be obedient before his birth when he travel for the tax all his life have many lesson of obedience he pay tribute unto Caesar customer be convent before his deputy confess his power be from above and over he what great humility can there be then that the son of God shall submit himself unto the son of man the lord of heaven unto a lump of earth and the king of king unto the subject of a king his death be the sum of all obedience he be obedient unto the death even the death of the cross and learn obedience in that he suffer the more he suffer he be willing to suffer more this he neither need nor deserve but that with his humility he will humble his follower under temporal authority now look upon the pope how fair he follow he far of Christ will not become a divider betwixt brother but the pope divide between prince as Alexander do the east and west indies between Portugal and Spain Christ will not ask his right albeit he be very near unto the crown the pope will have many crown albeit he have no right in they Christ be a king yet will seem none the pope be none yet will seem high like the roman dictator they detest the title yet arrogate great power to make their senate of cardinal as good as king the pope therefore be not the successor of saint Peter but of Caesar which be never great before he join the priesthood and empire in one person not the sole vicar of Christ but of Satan which promise all kingdom unto those that will fall down and worship he not the god of man as their gloss pretend but the man of sin who set himself above all that be call God on earth i. all civil power there have be great contention betwixt the spiritual and the civil state and it have fare with we as gedeons fleece when it rain on the fleece it rain not on the ground when on the ground not on the fleece when the spiritualty be rich the temporality be poor now the laity be rich the spiritualty be poor I will to God as we may meet in faith we may in love and both be content one with another advancement and prosperity the civil state shall be like a father to provide for we while the the spiritual as a tutor do instruct we the civil as a good husband shall care for such thing as be abroad the spiritual as a good housewife tend that which be within our door in our conscience the civil as our head to guide our outward motion and the spiritual as our heart for to direct our affection both of they shall be like Atrides (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) the two shepherd of the people like Amarias and Zebadiah they shall meet in one to consult upon the business of God the king and commonwealth like both our hand they shall work together for the whole body of the kingdom so that both be subject unto the king which in this be not mere a mere lay-man much less a clerk but like the soul which do all in all yet be not any part like a centre in who the line of all inferior power do meet yet be no line like the sun which work contrary by the same force yet feel not the mixture of any such quality thus the king of Israel have and over priest and people David as he rule these prudent with all his power he set they likewise in their order Solomon as he judge betwixt harlot he depose Abiathar and put Zadocke in his room jehosaphat as he send the judge he send the priest and levite into the province let every soul than say saint Paul the soul of the priest say Chrysostome as well as of the people even the soul of saint Peter which be one of the roman church be subject unto these high power to determine all in a word we may conclude the pope as blackwell say have ability to rule prince when they be willing but the king have authority to rule man whether they will or no the pope may be Christ vicar like other priest when he preach and minister the sacrament in steed of he but the king be God vicegerent as anastasius the pope call anastasius the emperor and the pope entitle Lucius king of Britain to judge and execute his judgement upon earth the pope may bar the king from his mass indulgence and his own orison and the king may bar the pope from intermeddle with his kingdom let they like jacob and Laban not pass this pillar towards one another for evil and all thing else will quiet be compose but if by violence of his excommunication the pope licence any to take arm he go beyond his and know not of what spirit he be for as saint Bernard say of your power consist not in expel any from possession but in expel sin from they the key of heaven be not give unto such purpose the rod of Moses may be turn into a serpent but the rod of Aaron bud and bode peace David can not build the temple be stain with blood Paul protest he be pure from the blood of all Gregory though he may have kill the goth he will not meddle in such bloody matter and shall the pillar of the sanctuary the successor of s. Paul and Gregory fill their heart and hand with such practice ever bless be the right worthy earl of which have set his rest on this that never any protestant regular or unconformitant do ever mingle their difference with bloody massacre but it be excellent note of the most noble and learned earl of Northampton that there be never any disturbance of the state without a priest by their fruit then you shall know they envy strife and sedition be from a wisdom which be earthly sensual and devilish but the wisdom from above be pure and peaceable easy to be entreat and the fruit of righteousness be sow in peace of they which make peace excommunication be not now worse then in the day of Samuel when Saul have be accurse of God so far that he may not be pray or mourn for yet he can not be kill or deprive of David the next anoint not worse then in the day of Christ which will have we count excommunicate for heathen and publican yet himself will eat and civil converse with they not worse then in the day of saint Paul who deliver over a incestuous person unto Satan that his spirit may be save in the day of the Lord now their spirit can be save if they be slay excommunicate the company that he forbid be not that we shall utter forsake their society for than we must forsake the world but that we shall abstain from their communion we shall not eat with they of the same unleavened Passover Christ jesus we shall seek to restore they in the spirit of meekness we shall strive to do good unto all though they be not of the household of faith saint Paul think it sufficient that the excommunicate be rebuke of many but our adversary be not satisfy unless they take life and al. God banish Adam out of paradise and yet he give he certain mean to live God holy spirit part from the former world yet he leave they one hundred and twenty year leisure to repent themselves God sever Mirian from the camp yet he will have the people to stay for she that she shall not utter be desolate and shall we censure more severe than the lord of host hereupon their own decree affirm that excommunication be not but not a kill but heal sword saint Austin say it be not but a penalty for the soul not for the body cyprian show the very case suppose a evil doer can be sever without sedition be wheat and bear with tare thus do saint Ambrose excommunicate Theodosius his threaten be we can fight but pray it be the tear of our eye not weapon in our hand which must overcome you our warfare be not carnal but spiritual and mighty through God we must fight with knowledge against ignorance with humility against pride with example of obedience against wilfulness in wickedness how many jew turk atheist epicure and murderer do God now suffer in this world and set a mark on they as on Cain that none shall kill until he please to take they hence can any thing then be so shameless under the pretence of religion to murder who they listen as that Friar do who slay six score with his own hand in a french massacre their doctrine therefore can be but impious against God in depose or abuse his officer for he will take it as if it be himself as he say of Samuel they have not cast away thou but i it be heretical against the scripture which command the contrary truth love and peace it be abominable and so damnable in their own conscience the censure of the world and the sight of God although the pope propose it as yet their guilty conscience foretell heavy thing and in their heart they love the deed as far as it profit they but the doer they will have in bitter detestation much more the world hate this and for it own safety will not suffer such a sin unpunished nature abhor murder as appear by the bleed of the murder in the presence of the murderer much more the murder of a prince who life have be account sacred in all age country and religion much more under the colour of religion when God holiness be make a patron of such devilish treachery and therefore in his judgement he will punish the less offender with less torment and these with worst and most as be most mischievous man thus their opinion must needs be absurd which pull all king and kingdom from God power and leave they in the disposition of a weak old sinful man as then this oath may betake with a good conscience be undertake it must be keep notwithstanding all absolution it may be wisdom as time alter to change a opinion but it be impiety to break a resolution ground on God word zachariah behold a fly book the length be 20 the breadth be 10 cubit which enter into the swearer house and eat up the timber and stone thereof but now we may behold a fly bull of mighty voice but little force which come from Rome to licence and command many to forswear themselves if one magistrate infringe what a other have determine there follow nothing but confusion God although that he promise whatsoever we bind or loose on earth shall be so bind or loose in heaven yet he never promise we may lose on earth what be already bind in heaven woe to they therefore which call evil good and good evil which will make and break the sevenfold bind of a oath as the Hebrew name import as Samson do the new make cord with little force or care who can this be but Antichrist who sit in the temple of God will exalt himself above God so far as to dissolve the bond make sacred by his holyname and bring that blemish upon Christianity which even jew and turk abhor who say the cause of our christian trouble be our daily blasphemy and perjury this doctrine of absolution be so contrary to inward peace and outward honesty so odious in itself perilous for example scandalous to the church preiudicious in the confederacy of prince and suspicious in all contract for if our covenant be never so sure write on earth and register in heaven yet they say they may be cancel of his holiness that it can be suffer in a christian common wealth look then into the word of God whether it be better obey the king in keep of a lawful oath than a stranger in break it look into thy conscience whether it can be discharge of perjury by the bull of such a bishop look unto the judgement of all flesh whether the pope pardon can prove a against hell thus we must not look for absolution equivocation and mental reservation be as dangerous they be solaecisme in reason much more absurd in conscience and Christianity this be Lysander note crime to deceive child with trifle and man with oath this be that heinous fault of ananias he tell not all he shall have tell but keep half back for his own profit and so lie against the holy ghost this be the custom of heretic to protest one faith and have another in their bosom this be the shame of Christendom since this doctrine be defend man make a common trade of lie and deceive this be the heart and the heart whereof David so complain the dissemble to satisfy for the present which Eleazar much abhor the trick of a false brother which have the voice of jacob and the hand of Esau he speak like a friend and deal like a enemy the satire can not abide he can blow both hot and can Solon condemn (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) ambidexter in their word and deed God will not suffer man to halt between two opinion and therefore christian shall hate such amphibology as they love God reason and religion to conclude the scope and duty of this oath be honest be faith love and peace the example have be sort in many counsel father and history the promise be a conscionable protestation of a loyal heart this oath be like Shibboleth if you pronounce it right you shall be receive if not reject like joshua question be thou on ourside or on our adversary like ichues demand of jonadab if thy heart be right towards i as i towards thou then ascend into my chariot if you love the safeguard of your prince as he tender your safety you shall purchase his favour take it then as give by good authority prayer be a duty most necessary to be make for king we must not pray without faith for without faith it be impossible to please God what we believe we may well swear and therefore we may swear for our prince honour and safety a oath be (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) a end of all controversy now there be a controversy whether he which take the pope for his god can take the king for his master and this oath will determine it a oath be to be take say Isocrates (@) (@) (@) (@) (@) either to clear thyself of some filthy crime and what fowler then high treason or to free thy friend from a danger and what great than such a suspicion it be reason they that receive protection shall promise love and duty to he which be the cause of it be honest to profess with our mouth what we mean in our heart observance where it be deserve it be a duty which the pope in far strict term exact of all emperor jesuit priest and auertite from our profession why shall not christian king require all faithfulness of their subject king may command a public fast as the king of ninive do unto man and beast or public feast as Mardochaeus and Maccabaeus do unto the jew or public oblation as Moses to the make of the tabernacle and josiah to the repair of the temple or public prayer as David indite holy psalm to be sing in the sanctuary and therefore may compose and impose a oath which be not so precise a part of religion a oath be use in covenant of reconcilement as between Abraham and Abimelech and shall not we rather be reconcile with our king then a stranger it be a motive of diligence as when Saul swear the soldier they shall not eat they be more earnest upon their enemy it be as a vow before God and man of that which law conscience and humanity require at our hand and vow in lawful matter be never to be reprove this be use of heathen among themselves as the roman citizen be swear unto their law and commonwealth of christian to heathen as the christian soldier do take a sacred oath of their captain to rest at their command of heathen to the faithful as jacob take a oath of Laban swear by his god say one we shall so much observe the law that we may swear the performance king be keeper of each table may swear their subject to the keep of both law most chief that which concern God or themselves for they be first and chief mean and mention in the commandment let i then say with Solomon I advertise thou to take heed unto the mouth of the king and the word of the oath of God for the king sake observe the oath for the oath sake observe the king for God sake observe both god oath and King oh bless god by who king reign and prince decree justice preserve thy servant our sovereign in thy truth peace and love set he as a signet on thy heart with inward grace and favour still embrace and increase he set he as a signet on thy hand with outward force and power still protect and defend he give he a long life a safe estate a wise heart a love care honour among his own and victory against his eninemy grant this most merciful father for thy son Christ jesus sake to who with thou and thy most holy spirit be give honour and dominion now and ever amen
