THE FIRST PART. The Company or Corporation of Polititians, sets vp a Ware-house or publike Shop in Parnassus, in which are to be sold diuers kinds of wares vsefull for the vertuous life of the learned. The first Raguaglio of the first part. T He great businesse, which the Corpora∣tion of Polititians hath for so many moneths negotiated with these Ex∣chequer-officers, that they might set vp a publike Ware-house, common to their Nation, in Parnassus, with large priuiledges for Politians, was the last week fully concluded and established. And euen yesterday, in the great Market-place, they made a most sumptuous shew of all such wares, as men commonly do most stand in need of. And euen as Menante will not thinke his labour ill em∣ployed to giue you notice of the chiefest of them; so is hee perswaded, that some honest man will not disdaine to reade them. First then, there is to be sold in that admirable Ware∣house great store of stuffing, or (as some call it) quilting, which though it be of no esteeme among the base and vulgar sort of men, yet is it valued and bought vp at a very high rate of many wise and vnderstanding men, namely, of Cour∣tiers, who haue discouered, that it is the shearings or nap of those rich clothes of Prudence, which wise men weaue with the fine wooll of Patience, and serues to boulster or fill vp the pads of seruitude, or pack-sadles of bondage, to the end they may fit the more easie vpon the backes of wretched Cour∣tiers, and hide those lothsome bloudy gallings and festered sores, which seem most vgly in such men, who albeit they be knowne for capitall enemies vnto all paines and labour, are not notwithstanding induced to serue & follow the Courts, with an assured hope, there to liue an idle merry life, and proudly to command others. It hath by diuers beene obser∣ued, (as a thing regardfull) that many young men, who though they may liue well in their own Fathers houses, haue neuerthelesse bought vp good store of that precious stuffing, and haue therwith quilted certaine petty boulsters, vnto w ch they enure themselues in the seruice of priuate houses, only that they may not come into Courts, as vnbroken colts, and in receiuing the first time the boistrous heauy pack-saddle of Court seruitude, assure themselues not to commit those fond actions, and fantasticke prankes, which enforce house-ste∣wards, and hall-vshers (who are the rough house-breakers of young Courtiers ) to giue them some lashes of bitter di∣stastes, thereby to bring them vnto the patient toleration of that irkesome and toilesome thraldome. There is also sold in the said Ware-house great store of most excellent Pencils for those Princes, who in their vrgent occasions, are often en∣forced to paint white for blacke vnto their people. And al∣though this be a merchandize only fit for Princes, yet doe those false-hearted men make great prouision of them, that relying on the traffique of apparances, apply themselues to nothing more, than to the infamous profession to leere and laugh in ones face, and vnderhand craftily to deceiue him, and to winde about the silly credulons people with fawning faire words, and foule tainted deeds. They haue likewise an infinite quantity of spectacles of admirable and sundry ver∣tues: Some of which serue to giue light vnto those salacious and beastly luxurious men, whose sight doth so faile them in the fury of their vnbridled and libidinous lust, that they cannot discerne Honour from Infamie, nor know a friend from a foe, a stranger from a kinsman, nor any other thing worthy of respect. So great is the riddance, that those Politicke merchants do hourely make of such spectacles, as all may euidently per∣ceiue, that few or none are those men, that in carnall things haue a good or cleare sight. They haue besides a kinde of spectacles, which serue to dimme all light, and shorten all sight: and the Politicians themselues affirme, that albeit these spectacles are more be∣hoouefull vnto all sorts of men, than those that extend the sight farre off, yet are they most needfull vnto Courtiers, by reason, that there doe often present themselues most loth∣some and nastie things vnto the sight of honest men. And for so much as to turne ones backe towards them may breed displeasure, yea and anger in mightie men or great Lords: and to looke vpon them is a torment and vexa∣tion vnto an honest minde: And therefore for a man vpon any such occasion to put so strange spectacles vpon his nose, he is free frō the troublous molestation to see the lothsome and abominable things of this fil the corrupted world, and the vulgar silly multitude is induced to thinke, that a man viewes them with more heedie curiositie. There are also other spectacles very good to preserue the sight of those vnkinde and vnthankfull men, which the ve∣ry first day of any new dignitie receiued, waxeth so dim and misty, as it reacheth euen to the bounds of Ingratitude. The Politicians that keepe the shop and fell them, say that they are made with the precious stuffe of the fast-holding memory of benefits receiued, and of the remembrance of fore-passed friendship. But most wondrous are those spectacles framed with such skilfull art, that they cause to those that haue them on, Pleas to seem: Elephants, and Pigmeys Giants. These are greedily bought vp by certaine great men, who putting them vpon the noses of their vnfortunate attendants, do so alter and di∣stract their sight, as if their Lord doe but once lay his hand vpon their shoulder, or looke vpon them with a smile, though artificiall, and perhaps forced, they deeme it as a re∣ward of fiue hundred crownes a yeere. But the spectacles lately inuented in the Low-countries are likewise bought vp at a very deare rate by great Lords, and distributed among their Courtiers, which being vsed by them, they cause those offices and rewards, to which their sight shall neuer attaine, not perhaps their age reach, to seeme neare at hand. Moreouer, there are to be sold in the said Ware-house (but at a most excessiue rate) humane eyes, which are of admirable vertue, since it is impossible to thinke, how infinitely a man bettereth his owne things, when he viewes them with o∣thers eyes: yea the very Politicians themselues protest vpon their cōsciences, that with no other, or better instrument, may a man sooner attaine vnto the happinesse, to purchase that thrice excellent vertue, so ambitiously aimed at, and sought after by great men, of NOSCE TE IPSVM. There are also sold in that shop, certaine Compasses, not made of siluer, of brasse, or of steele, but of the pure interesse of the most fine reputation, that may be found in all the Mine of Honour: And they are most admirable to measure a mans owne proper actions, since experience hath manifestly cau∣sed all men to know, that Compasses framed of the base stuffe of fantasticke conceit, of selfe-will, or of meere interresse, do seldome proue iust and true to those, who in their owne af∣faires desire to draw their liues parallel. Moreouer, such Compasses proue most excellent to those, that doe exactly possesse the skill and art to vse them, to take the iust measure of the latitude of those ditches, which for their credit and reputation they are compelled to leape cleane ouer, and not runne in danger to fall or stumble in the middle of them, and mefully bury themselues aliue in the puddle of folly and vnheedinesse: Nor can those lauish waste-goods, and spend-thrifts, whose purses being but shallow and poore, will waste and spend like Princes, with any other instrument, bet∣ter learne the most necessary vertue to make the step answe∣rable to the leg, than with these Compasses. The said Politicians doe likewise sell a numberlesse quan∣titie of boxes or leather-cases full of Mathematicall Instru∣ments, such as Surueyors or Land-Meters doe vse, which are more than necessarie, exactly to measure, and in all dimensi∣ons to square out those with whom a man is to treat about graue affaires, and important negotiations, or to confer and impart weighty secrets. The said warehouse hath also great vtterance of certaine Iron-tooles, which resemble those, that Chirurgions or tooth-drawers vse, and call Barbicans. They serue to open and di∣late the chaps of those vnhappy Courtiers, which being to make a vertue of necessitie, are often compelled to swallow huge great pumpions in stead of small mastick pills. They haue likewise great store of Beesoms, made of cir∣cumspection, whereof warie Courtiens make good prouision aforehand, that they may euery morning and euening dili∣gently sweepe from off the staires, which they daily goe vp and downe, perilous hard Peasen scattered vpon them by certaine enuious and maleuolent spirits, who taking greater pleasure in spoiling other mens affaires than in accommoda∣ting their owne, doe onely exercise the shamelesse trade, and trecherous worke, of breaking the neck of honest and ver∣tuous mens reputation. Moreouer, there is in th shop to be sold (but for the weight in gold) a kinde of most perfect and superexcellent Inke of the maker, far more precious than Bise of the most far-fetched Azure, which by the quills of learned Writers (being vertuously and skilfully displaid on books) serueth to embalme the dead bodies of vertuous men, and to yeeld them most aromatically odoriferous vnto after-ages; where∣as those of the ignorant yeeld a most loathsome stench, and are soone turned into vselesse ashes. And with this ink only is the name of the learned eternized in the memorie of all Nations, which in the illiterate and ignorant doth sud∣denly die and vanish. A balsame (truly) of more than hu∣mane vertue, since those, that therewith annoint themselues, liue, although they die, and departing out of the world, but with their bodies, abide perpetually therein with the me∣morie of their learned works. An infinite summe of money doe likewise those Politici∣ans receiue daily for a kinde of Oyle, which they sell, for so much as it hath often beene experienced to be most exqui∣sitely auaileable, to comfort and corroborate the queasie sto∣macks of Courtiers, to the end that without enfeebling their constitution of Patients, the poore vnfortunate wretches, may the more easily and speedily digest the bitter distastes, which so often and daily they are enforced to swallow and pocket vp in Courts. They sell moreouer in certaine little viols of glasse, (of which Menante, who writes these present newes, hath been so fortunate as to get one at a reasonable rate) odoriferous hu∣mane sweat, most admirable to perfume those, who with the fragrancie of Muske and Ciuets of honourable labours will endeuour with pen in hand to appeare and ranke them∣selues among learned men. The said warehouse hath also great dispatch of a kinde of Penids, made of most fine paste-royall, very excellent to whet and stir vp the appetite of certaine wilfull sowre Stoicks, to the end, that with an insatiate greedinesse, they may know how to eat and feed on those loathsome dishes of this world, which albeit they recoyle and prouoke vomit in some, and are wholly repugnant vnto the taste and stomacke of good men, neuerthelesse there be some, who because they will not purchase the displeasure of great men, and so ouerthrow their owne affaires by pulling an old house on their heads, are forced to make shew and pretence, that they greedily de∣sire them, and with hungry rauenousnesse deuoure them. There are besides to be seene in that shop certaine great boxes full of Musk-comfets, very excellent to make the breath of those Secretaries, Priuy Counsellors, or Senators in Common-wealths (who are bound to let secrets putrifie in their bodies) to yeeld a sweet sauour. Then in a back-roome and seuerall Magazin, they sell certaine horse-pasterns or fetters, made of the iron of consi∣derate maturitie, which, though by some foolish kinde of men, they be scorned and reiected as implements for beasts, the wiser and more warie haue lately brought them into so great credit, as they are daily bought vp at an excessiue price by those precipitate and foole-hardie wits, that fearing, or scorning the iudicious maturitie of the ordinarie Carier, take pleasure rashly, and hand-ouer-head to addresse and compasse all their affaires by Posts and Curriers. But no other merchandise of that rich warehouse hath lately had greater vtterance, than certaine Fann's, made, not of the feathers of Ostriges, of Peacocks, or of any other gay-coloured bird, but of herbs and flowers. And because Mr. Andrea Mathioli, the Delphick Herbalist, hath among those flowers and herbs found and knowne the drearie and infernall weed, Wolues-bane, the warie and fore-seeing ver∣tuous Inhabitants of Parnassus, haue euidently discouered, that those mysterious Fann's, serue not to make wind in the h at of summer, but to rid and driue away from mens noses those importunate flies, which certaine ill-aduised and vn∣heedie spirits, hauing gone about to remoue, by hitting them with their daggers, haue shamefully slit and cut their owne noses. The most soueraigne vertue Fidelitie, being se∣cretly fled from Parnassus, Apollo hauing discouered where shee had hidden her selfe, dispatcheth the two most excellent Muses, Melpomene and Thalia, to perswade her to returne. Rag. 11. 1 Part. THE Royall Palace of the soueraigne vertue Fide∣litie, which whilome was so frequented by the chiefest and most eminent Officers of Princes, and by an infinite number of Senators of the most renowmed Common-wealths, is of late so little haunted, that it seemeth to be the house of desolation. Whereupon, on the 18. day of this present moneth, the honourable man∣sion of so excelse a vertue was seene to be cleane shut vp. Apollo was no sooner aduertised of so important a case, but he commanded, that the gate of her famous Palace, should with violence be laid open; and that from the Ladie Fide∣litie herselfe, they should vnderstand the true occasion of so strange a noueltie. His Maiesties beheast was forthwith put in execution, and they, who most exactly searched each corner of the Royall Palace, found no creature therein, which the vertuous Inhabitants of Parnassus vnderstanding, they presently put themselues into mourning weeds, sprink∣led themselues with ashes, and shewed diuers other signes of sad sorrow: yea and Apollo himselfe in particular did so grieuously condole, that all the Court might euidently per∣ceiue in him those very same effects of inward sorrow, which he publikely made demonstration of, at what time the waile∣full and deplorable disaster befell his vnfortunate Sonne Phaeton. His Maiestie well knowing, that the gouern∣ment of Mankind would goe to wrack, if the solide founda∣tion, which vpholdeth all this worlds machine, should faile, caused presently certaine Edicts to be proclaimed, wherein (both to the ignorant, and to all others incapable of the most noble prerogatiue, to liue with honourable fame and good report in the memory of men) he freely granted a hundred yeares of immortalitie, to be deliuered him so soone as he should finde out, where that famous vertue had hidden herselfe. And to assure the payment promised, the Royall Exche∣quer-Chamber deliuered bills of exchange, and letters of assignation, signed by Homer, by Virgil, by Liuie, and by most wealthy Tacitus; all of them principall and most emi∣nent Merchants in the Factorie of Paruassus, amongst those vertuous men, who with their praise-worthy studies, wholly apply themselues to the right noble and honest traffique, to e ernize others names in the memorie of all Nations. The greatnesse of the promised reward inuited diuers to goe seeke her out. And after much pursuit and exact diligence, the Royall Maiestie Fidelitie was found in a stable, lying among the Hounds and Spaniels be∣longing to the famous hunter Acteon, and of most louely Adonis. Apollo being in all possible haste aduertised of so strange a noueltie, did immediatly send thither the two Soueraigne Muses, Melpomene and Thalia, to the end that remouing so excellent a Virtue from so vile and loathsome a place, they should reconduct her to her wonted habitation. But all endeuours proued vaine: for that glorious Princesse, bit∣terly bewailing her disastrous condition, cried out, Oh you Sacred Di ties, relate vnto my Soueraigne good Lord Apollo from me, that my eternall and most capitall enemy Fraud, hath at last obtained a compleat victorie, touching the con∣trouersie, that shee hath euer had with me: And how that infamous Interesse, who in these dismall daies, tyrannizeth ouer the minds of all the best Nations, hath rigorously ba∣nished me from out the hearts of men, which in former times were wholly mine. Let his Maiestie likewise vnderstand, that the whole Vniuerse is so deeply plunged in the filthy mud of all abo∣minable and brutish pollutions, that the constant Fidelitie, honourably and faithfully to serue her Lord or Prince, euen to the effusion of the last drop of her heart-bloud, and to the emmission of the last gasps of life, which erst was so admi∣red, and ambitiously sought after, is now adaies reputed no better, than a foolish and hare-brain'd obstinacie. And tell him moreouer, that if a man (so he may accommodate and fit himselfe to all times to all places, and to all persons) haue a fraudulent heart, full-fraught with perfidious trechery, and readily disposed, to exercise whatsoeuer execrable Infidelity, or damnable periurie; the same is now adaies commended and extolled, to be wisdome, sagacitie, and warinesse of an all comprehending and reaching wit. And tell him, that I, a poore abiect creature, glutted, and euen tyred to see so fil∣thie and opprobrious things, am inforced to imbrace the resolution (as you see) to liue among these dogs, in whom I now finde that true Fidelitie, which with so much toyle∣some carke, I haue euer laboured, and wearied my selfe to insert and plant in the perfidious and interessed heart of all men. Apollo perceiuing the great disorders, that the flight of the sacred vertue Fidelitie, bred in all Mankind, by the mediation of the Soue∣raigne Muses, and of the sublime Heroike Ver∣tues, obtaineth her returne into Parnassus. Rag. 30. 1 Part. NO tongue can fully expresse what anxietie and an∣guish Apollo fell into by the secret and sudden de∣parture, which (as by our former Letters hath al∣ready beene signified) the excellent vertue Fideli∣tie (some weeks since) made from this state of Parnassus. For his Maiestie could not possibly be at peace, or take any rest, to see the world depriued of so noble a Princesse. And his afflictions were daily increased by the foule disorders, which continually were heard to multiply in all Principalities, be∣tweene the common people, and thrice-sacred Amicitia (the only exquisite delight of Mankind) who seeing her selfe forsaken by that pre ious vertue Fidelitie; and fearing to re∣ceiue some notable affront by Fraud, absolutely denide to inhabit any longer in the hearts of men, who freed from the oath of Fidelitie or Allegeance, which indissolubly they owe vnto their Princes; and likewise loose from the bond of that sincere loue, with which they are fast tied vnto their priuate friends, became so fell in perfidiousnesse, so brutish in seditions, as making euery most detestable wickednesse to seeme lawfull; they with treacherie chased vnspotted Faith∣fulnesse from all humane societie, and with foule seditions, sacred Peace; defiling the whole world with bloud, and filled the same with most villanous Larcenies, and with all manner of perfidious and execrable confusion. Besides, the iust grieuances and complaints of Princes did continually molest Apollo's minde; which Princes did openly protest, that by the damnable infidelitie of their subiects, they were inforced to abandon the gouernance of Mankind: where∣upon Apollo, to finde out some conuenient remedie against so notorious a mischiefe, thought it expedient to intimate the high Court of Parlament of all the generall Estates, against the twentieth of the last moneth, vnto which hee summoned the Poet-princes, and the Deputies of all vertu∣ous Nations. All which being in great diligence appeared on the prefixed day, there were discouered in many people great hatreds against their Princes, all which protested open∣ly, that not by the vice of Infidelitie, but vrged and euen compelled by desperation, they had for euer banished from out their hearts that Fidelitie, which, as most hurtfull and preiudiciall to them, they were resolutely determined neuer to acknowledge and re-admit: forsomuch as shee was most foulely abused by many Princes. And whereas in former times, the Fidelitie of Subiects, hauing euer serued as an in∣strument to induce Princes, to counterchange the awe and seruice of their people with gentle and courteous vsages, they now clearely perceiued, that the vertue of a base and prostrate obedience, was reputed but the basenesse of an ab∣iect minde, and the merit of a voluntarie and vntainted faithfulnesse, a necessitie to serue; by reason of which man∣ner of proceeding, publike mischiefes and disorders were vncontroledly gone so farre, that many people had beene compelled to vndertake the resolution, which the world now saw; onely to the end, that humorous and capricious Princes should come to the perfect knowledge, that the au∣thoritie to sway and command may easily be lost, when the outrages, ingratitudes, and misusages, daily vsed towards subiects, hauing surmounted all humane patience, brought all nations (naturally inclined to dutifull obedience) euen vnto desperation; and neuer any more to liue in subiection of Masters; with an obstinate resolution, rather to wrach on a free gouernment, than to be continually contemned, abused, flaied, hurried and molested vnder Principalities. Although the rage and disdaine of Princes towards their sub∣iects were great, and the distaste of the people greater, the soueraigne Muses neuerthelesse, with the assistance of the thrice-excellent heroick Vertues, who effectually labou∣red to bring a businesse of so great consequence to some good end, with the dexteritie of their wit, in the end they somewhat calmed and asswaged the minds of the angry Prin∣ces, and instigated the proud hearts of the enraged people: And the Court of Parlament was dissolued, with the capi∣tulation of this atonement, that the people should solemnly vow and promise forthwith to readmit into their breasts the excellent vertue Fidelitie, which they should sweare to make absolute Mistris of their hearts. And that Princes should be strictly bound, to banish and expell from out their hearts, Auarice and Crueltie; and in lieu of them, yeeld the free possession of their mindes vnto the Soueraigne Vertues, Liberalitie, Bountie, and Clemencie, who were they, that perpetually held Fidelitie and Obedience fast ettered in the hearts of subiects: Since that by an autenticall testimonie, subscribed by Caius Pliuius, and other naturall H storians, it most euidently appeared, that the sillie sheepe, who are seene so gently and willingly to obey their shepherds, doe not∣withstanding shun and abhor all Butchers. And that it was impossible to induce Dogs (although naturally most trusty, louing, and kinde to their masters) to wag their taile, or to leape, and faune on those, that gaue them more stripes than morsels of bread. Iustus Lipsius, to make amends for the fault hee had committed in accusing of Tacitus, doth so passionately obserue him, that before Apollo he is charged to idolatrize him: whereupon af∣ter a faigned, and but verball punishment, hee it in the end by his Maiestie, not only absolued, but highly commended and admired. Rag. 86. 1 Part. THE most curious learned of this State, haue often obserued, that whensoeuer any vertuous man, doth through humane frailty commit any ouersight, for the dread w ch he afterward seeleth of wicked acti∣ons, doth in such sort (with falling into the other extreame) correct the same, that some there be who affirme, that Demo∣critus did not so much for the benefit of contemplation, pull out his owne eyes, as for to make amends for the errour hee had committed, laciuiously gazing vpon a most beautious Damsell, than beseemed a Philosopher of his ranke and profession. And the report yet goeth among the vertuous, that Harpocrates, to correct the defect of ouermuch babling, for which he was greatly blamed at a great banquet, fell in∣to the other extreame, neuer to speake more: Nor ought the sentence of the Poet be accounted true, Dam vitant stulti vitia, incontraria currunt. Since that, in a Dog that hath once bin scalded with boi∣ling water, it is held a point of sagacitie, to keepe himselfe in his kennell when it raineth. As likewise it is the part of awary man to auoid Eeles, if hee haue once beene deadly bitten by Snakes. This we say, for so much as so great was the griefe, and so notorious the agonie, that Iustus L psius felt for the accu∣sation, which he so vnhappily framed and published against Tacitus, that to repaire the fault, which of all the vertuous of this State was exceedingly blamed, not long after fell in∣to that errour, and went in person to visit Tacitus, and for the iniury which he acknowledged to haue done him, hee most humbly begged pardon at his hands. Tacitus knowing what reputation the readinesse of a free and genuine pardon yeeldeth a man, with a magnanimity worthy a Romane Senator, not only frankly and generously forgaue Lipsius the iniury receiued, but (which by the vna∣nimous report of all the vertuous of this State hath deser∣ued highest commendations) he most affectionately thanked him for the occasion he ministred vnto him, to make pur∣chase of that glory, which sincerely to forget all iniurious affronts receiued, doth procure and conferre vpon a man, vnto the ancient and most affectionate deuotion, which Lip∣sius (who had euer bin most partially affected vnto Tacitus ) had euer borne vnto so sublime an Historian; the wonder of so great indulgence being adioyned, and the facility of a p rdon so earnestly desired, did so encrease the loue in his minde, and so augment his awfull veneration towards him, that hee more frequented Tacitus his house than his owne. Hee now loued to discourse with no other learned man: no conuersation did more agrade him: he commended no other Historian: and all with soth partiality of inward affe∣ction, namely, for the elegancie of his speech, adorned more with choise conceits, than with words; for the succinctnesse of his close, neruous, and graue sententious Oratorie, cleare onely to those of best vnderstanding, with the and ha∣tred of other vertuous men of this dominion, dependents of Cic ro, and of the mighty Caesarean faction, who approue it not. And did with such diligence labour to imitate him, that not onely with hatefull antonomasia, hee dared to call him his Auctor, but vtterly scorning all other mens detecti∣ons, he affected no other ambition, than to appeare vnto the world a new Tacitus. This so vnwonted kindnesse among friends, neuer seene from inferiours towards their superiours, and which excee∣ded the most hearty loue or affection that any can beare and expresse to the nearest of his blood, engendred such a iealou∣sie in the minds of Mercerus, of Beatus, Rhenanus, of Ful∣uius Orsinus, of Marcus Antonius Muretus; and of diuers others, followers and louers of Tacitus, that, induced there∣unto by meere enuy, hatched in their hearts (but according to the custome of worldly dissemblers, which is, to paliate the passion of priuate hatred with the robe of charity to∣ward their neighbour) vnder colour to reuenge the iniury, which not long since Lipsius had done vnto their friend Ta∣citus, they framed an enditement against Lipsius, and presen∣ted the same vnto Apollo, charging him with the same delict or crime of impiety, whereof he had accused Tacitus, gi∣uing his Maiestie to vnderstand, that hee loued not Tacitus as a friend, that he honoured not him as a Master, and regard∣full Patron, but adored him as his Apollo and Deitie. This accusation, which as in crimes of capitall treason, by rea∣son of it's hainous outragiousnesse, needeth no other proofe than the bare testimony of any one man, did enter so deepe∣ly into Apollo 's minde, as hee deemed himselfe offended by Lipsius in the highest degree, caused him forthwith to bee brought before his Maiestie, by the Pretorian band of the Lyrick Poets, fast bound in chaines and gyues; and staring on him with a fierce wrathfull countenance, and with death-threatning gestures, demanded of him, What his genuine opinion or conceit was of a certaine fellow, called Cornelius Tacitus, borne of an oyle-monger of Terni. Lipsius vndismaiedly answered Apollo, That hee deemed Tacitus to be the chiefe Standard bearer of all famous Histo∣rians, the Father of humane wisdome, the Oracle of perfect reason of State, the absolute Master of Politicians. the stout Coripheus of those writers that haue attained the glory in all their compositions, to vse more conceits than words; the perfect and absolute forme to learne to write the actions of great Princes, with the learned & apparent light of the essen∣tiall source and occasion of them: a most exqusite artifice, and which was onely vnderstood by the sublimest master of the Historian Art, as that which greatly yeelded him glo∣rious, that knew how to manage it, and him truly learned that had the iudgment duly to consider the same; the per∣fect Idea of Historicall veritie; the true Doctor of Princes; the Pedagogue of Courtiers; the superfine paragon, on which the world might try the alloy of the Genius of Princes; the iust Scale, with w ch any man might exactly weigh the true worth of priuate men; the Volume which those Princes should euer haue in their hands, that desire to learne the skill and know∣ledge absolutely to command: as likewise those subiects, who wished to possesse the science dutifully and rightly to obey. By this so affected Encomium, and by so earnestly exage∣rated commendations, Apollo easily perceiued, and came to know, that Lipsius did manifestly idolatrize Tacitus, wher∣upon in minde enraged thus he bespake him. In what esteeme wilt thou then (Oh Lipsius ) haue mee, that am the father of all good letters, soueraigne Lord of the Sciences, absolute Prince of the liberall Arts, Monarke of all vertues, if with such impiety and shamelesse impudency, thou doest idolatrize a Writer, so hatefull vnto all good men? and an author so detestable vnto the professors of the Latinetongue, both for the nouelty of his phrase, for the ob∣struse obscurity of his speech, for the vicious breuity of his discourses, & for the cruell and tyrannous politicall doctrine which he teacheth? by, and with which, he rather frameth cruell Tyrants, than iust Princes; rather wicked and depra∣ued Subiects, than endowed with that vntainted probity, which so greatly auaileth, and facilitates in Princes the way how to gouerne their states mildly and vprightly. It being most apparent, that with his impious documents, and abo∣minable precepts, he peruerteth lawfull Princes into cruell Tyrants, he transformeth natural Subiects (which should be as milde and harmelesse Sheep) into most pernicious Foxes: and from creatures, whom our common mother Nature, with admirable wisdome hath created toothlesse and horne∣lesse, he conuerteth them into rauenous Wolues, and vnta∣med Bulls. Who sheweth himselfe a lye cunning Doctor of false si∣mulations, the only subtile artificer of treacherous tyrannies, a new Xenophon of a most cruell and execrable Tiberipedia, the wily forger of the euer to be detested mystery, how lee∣ringly to smile and therewith deceiue, how with facility to vtter and affirme that which a man neuer meaneth or in∣tends, effectually to perswade that which one beleeueth not, instantly to craue that which one desireth not, and to seeme to hate that which one loueth; who is a sublime Pedagogue to instruct others in that most villanous doctrine to smother and suppresse the conceits and meanings of a true-meaning heart, and yet to speake with a false-lying tongue: the in∣genious Architect of fallacies and deceits, and so singular and excellent an author of rash and fond-hardy iudgments, that he hath often most shamefully attributed holy interpre∣tations to most impious and to bee abhorred actions: And on the other side, hath cannonized sacred ones as Dia∣bolicall. And wilt thou (Oh Lipsius ) among so many my liege and trusty vertuous men, euen before my face, adore and wor∣ship as thy God, a man that in all his compositions hath ma∣nifestly declared, that he hath not knowne God? Who being composed of nought but impiety, hath sow∣ed and scattered through the wide world, that cruell, pro∣digious, and desperate policy, which so infinitely defameth those Princes that make vse of it, and so deepely afflicteth the people that feele it; who as well to Princes as to priuate men, hath taught the cursed way, and mischieuous fashion, how to conuerse and proceed with false doublenesse; and the treacherous Art, to doe that which a man saies not, and to say that which one meaneth not. A way which by some is practised onely to become skil∣full in that abhominable doctrine, how with the pensill of false pretences, to pourtray blacke for white; to circum∣winde the simpler sort of people with the fallacies of faire sugred words, and of lewd and wicked deeds; to deceiue all men with vsing laughter in anger, and weeping in ioy; and onely by and with the pernicious compasse of priuate interesse, to measure loue, hate, trust, faith, honestie, and each humane or morall vertue, read and perused by good men, onely to come to the knowledge of the new and hid∣den tricks and artifices, with which, in these daies, wretch∣ed mankinde with so euident calamitie, is most miserably circumgired, and tossed to and fro: and to discouer the most execrable hypocrisie, that diuers followers of so wicked an Art haue vsed and practised, to bee by the simpler sort of people reputed for men of vpright conuersation, and ho∣nest life; albeit, for to obserue and obey the rules of Tacitus, they act, and daily perpetrate deeds, that by the vgliest Di∣uels of hell, are deemed most abhominable. Perceiuest thou not (Oh Lipsius ) since the Volumes of this thy Tacitus haue past the hands of all people, diuers Princes haue straied and e onged themselues from the anci∣ent course, to gouerne their subiects with humanity, milde∣nesse, and clemency: and what an infinite number are now cleane parted & diuorced from the genuine plainnesse and singlenesse of atruly-vertuous life? Know Lipsius, that so great a part of Tacitus his workes (as some simple and shallow-brain'd men doe affirme) were not lost in the violent deluges of the barbarous Nations, which with so rapid inundations passed into Italy, to ouer∣runne and subdue it, for they miscaried, and were lost before so great ruines; not through the ignorance of the people, who in those turbulent and embroiled times, were continu∣ally busied in the exercise of armes, but because those yet vn∣tainted ancient Nations, in which reigned equally the well∣meaning simplicity of minde and heart, and the purity of the then new budding Christian Religion, abhorred that Au∣thor whom some ill aduised doe now so much loue and che∣rish, that (as I perceiue thy selfe hast done) many and diuers euidently idolatrizing him, haue ereared him for their gol∣den Calfe. Tacitus is in euery part of his most vnworthy to be read of good or honest men, for so much as the villa∣nies, and the impieties contained in his workes, doe far ex∣ceed in number his leaues, his lines, his words, his sillables, and his letters. But by the life of Tiberius, which hee hath compiled, a Prince sutable and worthy the genius of such an Historian, all must acknowledge the same to bee most intol∣lerable and damnable; the which for a singular benefit of all mankinde, hauing for many ages lyen secretly hidden in the most secret and concealed parts of Germany, through the pesti erous and diabolicall curiositie of a Germane, more dreary and fatall to all the world than his Compatriate, that was the first inuented the deadly and dismall Bombard, whence it was drawne forth, at what time that most noble Prouince began to be infected by the moderne heresie; on∣ly to the end, that with so horrid a prodigie, at the same time that execrable Luther began to molest and subuert the sacred rites, wicked Tacitus should embroile the prophane. Compositions in the highest degree most wicked and perni∣cions, which for many yeares were lost, because they plea∣sed not antiquity; and are now, to the great shame and re∣proach of this age, admired of those Polititians, who being followers of such impieties, haue most compleatly learn'd from the Master of fallacies and tromparies, the doctrine to know, how to the vtmost of a mans age, to entertainemen with faire words, to feed them with smoake, to fill them with winde, and with vaine-vaine hopes fairly to lead them to extreame beggery. A doctrine most assuredly infernall, which by Tacitus the the inuentor and husband thereof, hauing beene sowne and dispersed abroad, onely for the benefit of Princes, is now a daies seene to be imbraced and cherished with such insatiate greedinesse, by priuate and meane subiects, that Tacitus, who was herefore an Auth held onely worthy of Princes, doth now so publikely passe from hand to hand among all men, that euen Shop-keepers, fachius and base porters shew not themselues more cunning in any profession than of State policy, to the great contempt and derision of an Art held in highest regard and reputation of great men, the whole vni∣uerse is seene to swarme, and to be full of sharking and spoil∣trade Polititians. At these irefull and exorbitant speeches of Apollo, Lipsius stood amazed, as one halfe dead and distracted, yet notwith∣standing, euen in the vtmost abashment and consternation of minde, pulling vp a good heart, and taking breath, most submissiuely begged pardon of his Maiestie for any fault hee might haue committed; then boldly told him, that such and so infinite were his awfull obligations towards his beloued Tacitus, and so great was the honour, which among his Countrymen the Flemings, the English, the Germans, the French, the Italians, and the Spaniards, his bosome-minion, and most dearely beloued Author Tacitus had purchased him; whom though he acknowledged to loue most entirely, and to honour as his terrestriall God; yet, to attaine vnto a superlatiue degree of due satisfaction of his bounden du∣ty, and with exactnesse to accomplish the duty of true grati∣tude, he thought all he could doe to be nothing, in respect of his vnualuable merits. His reason was, that hauing published and left vnto the world, diuers ordinary labours and compositions, his onely workes vpon Tacitus were they, that had made him to me∣rit an abode and mansion in Pernassus, and an honourable and immortall renowne among many Nations: and that if he, who with other mens money exercised the trafficke of trading and rich merchandizing, was easily pardoned his errour, if hee did euen worship and adore him, that at his pleasure might make him breake and turne begger: How much more then did he deserue of his Maiestie to be, if not commended, yet at least excused, if in louing and honou∣ring his deare dearest Tacitus, he exceeded all bounds of du∣ty, of decorum, or of dignity, sithence in & vpon him only was grounded the whole fabricke of all the credit and esti∣mation that he had purchased among the vertuous. And that hee, euer since his first ingresse into Pernassus, had of all the learned bin so beloued, cherished, courted, and reuerenced, that his house was no otherwise frequented, then that of the most famous writers. But that after hee fell into the errour to make Tacitus his enemie, statim relictum illius limen, nemo adire, nemo solari: and therefore rather than hee would any whit diminish his veneration, and awfull respect toward that prime Author of his, he was well pleased to hate himselfe, and to lose his life, deeming the losse of the same farre lesse, than the great∣nesse of the fame, vnto which by meanes of Tacitus he had attained. So highly did these words of Lipsius offend Apollo's mind, that more and more enraged with fierce wrath, he vehement∣ly complained, that euen before his awfull presence with so impudent asseueration, hee had rather manifestly made de∣monstration of a wilfull stubbornnesse to perseuere in his stiffe opinion of so hainous an excesse, than humilitie to yeeld vnto penitence, and for his fault to craue p rdon. And aboue any other demerit of so obstinate a man, his Maiestie could by no meanes endure, that he had entitled the impiety of Idolatry, with the stile of honourable gratitude; and wil∣full obstinacie, with the title of a constant and vncorrupted truth. Whereupon he suddenly commanded the foresaid Co∣hort of the Lyricke Poets, presently to drag him out of his presence, as one most vnworthy to looke his Maiestie in the face, whom he had so capitally offended to the quicke. And that hauing stripped him of such good letters as he possessed, they should publikely proclaime him to be a most shamelesse ignorant Asse; and after burne him aliue, as a most wicked and detestable idolater. Forthwith was poore Lipsius brought, and haled vnto the place of so great infamie, where his friends most earnestly perswaded him to aduise himselfe, and at once, humbly u∣ing for mercy at his Maiesties hands, endeauour to saue both his life and reputation. In the very moment of desperation of so horrible and la∣mentable a plunge, it was manifestly perceiued, that at the apprehension thereof, there appeared in Lipsius such an vn∣danted constancie, and an vndismaid boldnesse of a couragi∣ous minde against the terrors of death, that he thus answe∣red Apollo. And let his will be done: for, he cannot die ignorant, that can perfectly demonstrate to possesse Gratitude, which is the Soueraigne Queene of all humane vertues. And therefore, the flames that were prepared to consume him, would yeeld a farre brighter splendor of Glory, than of Fire: and that euen in the last instant of his dying-life, he so∣lemnly protested, that he would in no wise acknowledge the crime wherewith he was charged, to haue ouer-much loued or superstitiously honoured his beloued Tacitus to be true. And that by reason of the infinite bonds, wherewith he stood tied vnto him, and for the respectfull loue he bare him; the griefe and molestation that he felt in remembring, that hee died vngratefull vnto him, did more excruciate and torment him, than the rigor or paines or death: and that the agony, in which they all saw him, proceeded not from the fright or terror hee felt, that hee must die, but from the inward pangs, and hearts griefe, which vexed him, in as much, that he had heard his Maiestie, name and pronounce Tacitus, to be a wicked Atheist. An iniurie, which had it beene vttered of so excellent and wise an Author by any other man what∣soeuer, then by his sacred Maiestie (euen in that last gaspe of life) he would neuer haue left it vnreuenged, at least with the weapons of his tongue. And that with the same libertie, which is so proper vnto such as care not to liue, hee made it knowne vnto all men, that the reall truth was, that Tacitus had so much knowledge of God, that he alone, among all the Heathen Writers, with his profound and exact knowledge, hauing attained perfectly to know of what worth and effica∣cie (touching matters of Religion) faith is of those things, which are not seene, or cannot by humane reason be proued, had boldly said, Sanctiusque ac reuerentius visum de actis Deorum credere, quam scire: Words most sacred, and well worthy to be considered by those Diuines, who in their wri∣tings had lost themselues in their Sophisticall subtilities, and Logicall nicities. Apollo hauing heard these things, as one possessed with wonderment, and full of admiration, presently caused Lipsius to be loosed, and most affectionatly embracing him, he thus bespake him; Oh my dearely beloued and vertuous Lipsius, with what comfort to me, and auailefull gaine to thee, haue I tempted thy patience, and made triall of thy most vertuous constancie? And by the bitter detractions, which I haue vttered against Tacitus, which are but those with which they accuse him, that either neuer reade him, or vnderstand him not, I haue throughly made proofe of thy zealous deuotion towards that most excellent Historian, whom I deeme wor∣thy my regardfull admiration. And by that, which I haue now heard from thee, I doe euidently perceiue, that thou hast read him with delight, stu∣died him with profit, and learnt him to thy great aduantage; for I know that the stout defence, which to thy immortall glory, thou hast made in his behalfe, is not thine owne, but drawne from thine and mine Tacitus. This said and done, Apollo turned himselfe towards the vertuous, who for curiositie, and to heare the successe of that great accident, were in great troupes flocked into the Hall, he thus said vnto them: Oh you my entirely beloued vertuous learned men, admire and perpetually imitate the renowned constancie of this my glorious vertuous Lipsius, and let the infinite dilection and sempiternall veneration of that Prince, be eternally imprin∣ted in your hearts, who strongly supporteth your reputation: And neuer forget that the credit and power of him, who lo∣seth the good grace and fauour of his Prince, doth more easily ruine, and precipitate, than doe the houses, whose foundations faile and decay. And therefore, you that follow Princes Courts, learne to know, that Nihil rerum mortalium tam instabile, ac fluxum est▪ quam fama potentiae non sua vi nixa. A most assured document, which teacheth all men, both in louing, in honouring, and in perpetually seruing their Prin∣ces with a most constant trust, and stedfast faith to imitate my Lipsius. For, euen as in sacred mysteries and holy rites, it is an vnpardonable and grosse impiety, to haue or acknow∣ledge any other God, than him, who hath created Man, the Heauens, and the Earth: So should you neuer admit into your hearts any other deuotion of Princes, nor at no time expect commoditie, or wish for preferment, except from that Lord, who by the trust and confidence, which he reposeth in your trust and fidelitie, by the extraordinary affection which he beareth vnto you, makes you to be knowne to all the world, not as his seruants, but as his deare friends. And by the supreme and vncontrolled authority, which he suffereth you to exercise in his dominions, causeth you to appeare and seeme vnto his other subiects (euen as himselfe is) so many Princes. And for so much as the great wittinesse and sagacity of Princes, by reason of the great iealousies and diffidences, that accompany those, who sway and raigne, is commonly accompanied by suspition, and fauourites or Minions in Courts, being euer aggrauated by enuy, euer pried into, and obserued by emulous competitors, and euer persecuted by the malicious or enuious; to the end you may the more suc∣cessefully ouercome so many difficulties, and may euer pro∣sperously maintaine your selues in the states and honours which you haue acquired; loue your Princes with all your hearts, obserue them with all your best affections, and euer∣more serue them with all possible faithfulnesse and since∣ritie. And rather, then so much as to thinke, much lesse to doe any thing, that may bring with it the least-least danger to di∣minish one iot of their good fauour (as my Lipsius hath done) chuse to yeeld vnto death. And beleeue confidently, that then beginneth your downefall, when by some fatall mischiefe of yours, you suf∣fer your selues to be perswaded or entangled, that you may better or aduantage the condition of your seruice, with, and by vsing with your Princes (who know so much, see so much, vnderstand so much, and obserue sa much, as more cannot possibly be knowne, seene, vnderstood, or obserued) simulation to seeme that, which one is not; the falshood at once to smile and deceiue: all double dealing, and to chew with both chaps: all cloging dissimulation in stradling ouer ditches, the better to be able (if euer his Prince should fall into some disaster) to take part with the Conquerour. For, Princes, who, suppose they know not so much, yet haue they euer so many whisperers about them, as one or o∣ther will bring them in tune. And when they sleepe, they are neuer destitute of wicked Spirits to keepe them awake. So that, they, who thinke it safe, and dangerlesse, to liue and hold out long with falshood and dissimulation, may rightly be compared vnto those fooles, that vndertake to cant Gipzies, to cheat cozeners, or that hope to sell false balls vnto Mountibankes. The chiefest learned men of Parnassus are sutors vnto Apollo; to enioyne Tacitus, to recompile those bookes of his Annales and Histories, which are lost. Rag. 84. 1. Part. YEster-day the chiefest learned men of this State of Parnassus met together in the common Colledge-hall, where after diuers long discourses past between them, they with one accord presented themselues before Apollo's Maiestie, vnto whom Petrus Victorius, a great learned man of Florence, in the name of all the rest, said, That those vertuous men, whom his Maiestie beheld, did most humbly beg a fauour at his hands, the most gracious, that euer hee could conferre vpon his learned followers, who with continuall brackish teares bewailed the disastrous losse of the Annales and Histories of Cornelius Tacitus; the father of humane wisdome, and true inuentor of moderne Policie, did most humbly coniure him, to command that excellent man to repaire the damages, which the iniury of times had caused, both to his reputation, and to the generall commo∣ditie of his vertuous followers, by framing all that anew, which at this day is wanting in his most excellent workes. At this request, which seemed both vertuous and reasonable, contrary to the opinion of all men, his Maiestie was much offended, and with manifest alteration of minde, he framed this answer: Oh you my ignorantly-learned friends, doth it not then seeme vnto you, that the Princes of this world are already ouer-cunning Statists, but that you wish them to be more perfect Doctors in that Science, in which for your last misery, they offend in being ouer-skilfull in the same? Since some of them with the practise of one truly Diabolicall and infernall Reason of State; it euidently appeareth, that they haue brought both Sacred and prophane things into a mani∣fest confusion: Haue not as yet the common miseries of so many scandals, which by the harsh and wrested gouernment of some Princes, are seene to arise in the world, opened your eyes so wide, as you may perceiue and know, that all mo∣derne Policie is but the trash of your so beloued Tacitus, and as a contagious disease hath infected all the world? Are you not yet come to the knowledge, that the now pre∣sent Reason of State, with which a number of people are rather flead than shorne; rather suckt drie, than milked; and rather oppressed, than gouerned. A thing in it selfe so exor∣bitant, it is meere ignorance to desire the same to be more violent? And doth it not seeme vnto you, that from the cruell gouernment of Tiberius, and from the prodigious life of Nero, so exactly written by your Tacitus, some mo∣derne Princes haue drawne most exquisite precepts, how to gnaw to the bone, and how to shaue to the braine? But that you would also haue them to haue the conueniencie, to see whether in the liues of Caligula and Domitianus, which to the end that the lothsome obscenities, and the barbarous cru∣elties, which those two vgly monsters of Nature committed, should for euer lye hidden: the Maiesty of the eternall God, for your incomparable benefit, hath exterminated from out the world, they might draw some secret precept, to make the fifth Act of the wofull and dismall Tragedie more fune∣rall and wailefull. A happie a d beneficiall gaine (oh you vertuous) for the whole world, hath the losse beene of the greatest part of Tacitus his labours. Oh how fortunate might men be reputed, if likewise those fatall reliques, which for the last calamitie of mankinde are left vnto vs, were also lost for euer. And that the world were gouerned with the modestie and simplicitie of the ancient Monarkes, who esteemed men as reasonable creatures, and not with the bitternesse of diuers moderne Princes, who ma∣nifestly seeme to beleeue, that they are but two-footed beasts, so created of God only for their benefit: euen as his Diuine Maiesty, to no other end caused the earth to produce Mice, but to fatten Cats. But you Sir Peter Victorius, since I see, that you also are of the number of those good men, that wish Tacitus were entire; be pleased that I speake a few words with you in priuate, since you haue spoken in behalfe of the publique. Doe you not thinke, that your Princes with the only first leafe of the Annales of Tacitus, which they so diligently stu∣die, and know so well to put in actuall practise, are become so skilfull Medices to cure the canker of the sedicious Flo∣rentine people? Thrice happie were all the world, if Taci∣tus had euer held his peace. Therefore get you gone in the name of God, together with the rabble of your learned Copes-mates; for my very heart is ready to burst, to see that men likewise are borne with the vnhappie calamitie of Thrushes. Cornelius Tacitus, for some complaints vrged against him by diuers great Princes, by reason of certaine politicall spectacles, which he hath deuised, most preiudiciall vnto their gouern∣ment, hauing beene emprisoned, is by Apollo set at libertie. Rag. 7. 2. Part. THe apprehending of the person of Cornelius Tacitus, which happened the last night by the expresse com∣mandement of the Lords Censors, hath caused great amazement throughout all the Vniuersitie of the learned men; being a man so remarkable in Parnassus, so deare vnto Apollo, prime Counseller of State, chiefe Chro∣nicler, and his Maiesties Master of Sentences. It was pre∣sently diuulged, that this hath happened by reason of some complaints exhibited against him by certaine most potent Princes, who haue grieuously complained and aggrauated, that Tacitus with the seditious argument of his Annals, and of his Histories, hath framed a kinde of spectacles, that work most pernitious effects for Princes; for so much as being put vpon the noses of silly and simple people, they so refine and sharpen their sight, as they make them see and prie into the most hidden and secret thoughts of others, yea euen into the centre of their hearts: and they protest, that they nor can, nor will euer by any meanes endure they should make appa∣rent demonstration vnto all men of the pure essence and qualitie of the mindes and purposes of Princes, what they are inwardly, and not what with their trickes and artifices (necessary for to rule and raigne) they endeuour to appeare outwardly. Yesterday morning the Atturney Generall of the greatest Monarks, now resident in Parnassus▪ appeared before the right honourable Lords Censors, among whom, in regard of the reputation of Tacitus his person, who was to be arraigned and adiudged, Apollo himselfe came and sate among them. This Aduocate or Atturney Generall with exaggerated words gaue them to vnderstand, that it was full well known to all the best vnderstanders of State-matters, that for the peace and tranquillitie of kingdoms, Princes are often com∣pelled to commit actions not greatly to be commended, which (to maintaine themselues in the peoples opinion, to be honest and vpright Princes, in which conceit, hee that reigneth must necessarily labour, and endeuour to keepe himselfe) they were wont to shadow and blanch ouer with the specious and precious pretexts of an holy and vndefiled intention, and of an honest, hearty, and affectionate zeale to∣wards the common good. All which tricks, deuices, and ar∣tifices, they can no longer put in practise or make vse of, if the true sense or meaning of their designes shall at any time come to the knowledge of the vulgar. And that if it were possible, that the people (without be∣ing subiect to others Empirie) might be gouerned of them∣selues, then would Princes most willingly renounce the Royall titles, and authoritie of commanding; forsomuch as they are now fully resolued, that Kingdoms and Principali∣ties are but insupportable burdens, subiects full-fraught with crabbed difficulties, and of so infinite dangers, as at their owne richly-sumptuous tables (so much enuied them by Gluttons and greedy Gourmands) they should neuer taste morsell, that would not relish of Arsenike. But if ex∣perience had made the world to know, that the sway and gouernment of Humane-kinde, without the presence of a wise and Politicke Prince, to rule and direct the same, would ere long be filled and ouer-run with wailfull and tragicall confusions. It is likewise conuenient, that all these iust and lawfull meanes be granted them as are requisite and behouefull vp∣rightly to gouerne their subiects: For, if to manure and till the fields, the Husbandman is not denide to haue his oxen, his plough, and his mattock: If the Taylor (to cut out and sew his garment) haue allowed him, both needle, thimble, and sheares; and the Smith, his hammer and his tongs; why shall Monarchs be depriued of meanes, and barred of power, hereafter to cast dust in their subiects eyes, which is the readiest benefit, the most excellent, and necessariest in∣strument, that euer any Politician could inuent, or finde in all the volume of State-reason (though most excellent) right∣ly to gouerne Empires? All which things, Princes (by rea∣son of the seditious inuention of Tacitus ) could no longer effect, or bring to passe: it being most euident, that the Dia∣bolicall spectacles, framed by that euer-factious and sediti∣ous man, besides the first qualitie (as hath beene said, to subtilize and sharpen the sight of the vulgar people) they produce also a second most pernicious effect, that is, to be so well and fitly fastned to the noses of all men, as it is no lon∣ger possible for Princes, (as heretofore they haue done, with no lesse facilitie, than profit to themselues) to cast dust into their subiects eyes, though it were of the most artificiall, and superfinest, that possibly could be, without plainly discoue∣ring, that they are cheated, cozened and deceiued. The complaints and grieuances of the Monarchies seemed most true both to Apollo, and to the venerable Col∣ledge of the Censors. And therefore they deemed them worthy to be maturely considered. Now by the long discourses and debatements, that pas∣sed among them, conc rning a businesse of so great conse∣quence, it seemed, that their opinion was likely to preuaile, who consured, that Tacitus together with his scandalous Annales, and his seditious Histories, should for euer be ex∣pulsed the society and conuersation of all men. But his Maiestie, vnwilling so much to vilifie or embase the Prince of all Politicall Historians, or to distaste honest Students, by depriuing them of their bosome-delights, was contented, that Tacitus should be giuen to vnderstand from his Maiestie, how his pleasure was, that of those spectacles (in very deed preiudiciall vnto Princes) he should frame as few as possibly could be. And that aboue all things, hee should vigilantly take great heed, not to disperse any abroad, except vnto choise and excellent men, vnto Secretaries, and vnto Priuy Counsellers of State to Princes, to the end they might serue to facilitate vnto them the good and vpright gouernment of their people. And that aboue all, (euen as he tendred or loued his Maiesties good fauour) he should take especiall care, neuer to impart or communicate any vnto those turbulent or factious spirits, which in seditious and duskie seasons, might serue in stead of bright lamps, or far∣seene beacons to that simple race of men, which is easily go∣uerned, as wanting the glorious light of letters, may be said to be blinde and without a guide. The Duke of Laconia, for hauing aduanced a most faithfull Secretarie of his, to the highest dignities of his estate, is accused before Apollo to idolatrize and dote vpon a Mignon: but he doth most egregiously defend himselfe. Rag. 38. 1 Part. THE now regnant Duke of Laconia hath of late aduanced one of his subiects (by him highly estee∣med, and extraordinarily beloued) from a base and low fortune to the highest dignities, and supremest honours of all his Dominion. For he hath not only placed him in the sublime Senate of the Laconians (a degree by rea∣son of its eminencie ambitiously aimed at, and sought after by diuers great Princes) but hauing infinitely enriched him with great reuenues, hath also made him to be as much ho∣noured and regarded as any whatsoeuer most renowmed subiect of all his State. This so worthy Duke, by those who enuie the greatnesse of that his seruant, was before Apollo's Maiestie denounced to be an Idolater of a Mignon, and a doter vpon a fauorite or darling. Apollo being highly moued against that Prince, for the hainousnesse of so horrible a delict (as his manner is in any outragious excesse) without taking diligent information of the truth of the accusation, presently caused Lewis Puloi, Prouost-Marshall of this State, to be called before him, whom he threatned to be rigorously tortured, if within the space of halfe an houre, with all manner of scorne and deri∣sion, he did not bring before him, fast bound in fetters, as prisoner, the Duke of Laconia. Pulci, with all exact dili∣gence accomplished Apollo's beheasts: for immediatly, all laden with heauy chaines, he haled and dragged the poore Prince before his Maiestie, who by an expresse messenger was presently aduertised of his attachment, and forthwith commanded the Martelli, most vertuous Florentines, and publike Bell-ringers of Parnassus, that by the olling of the greatest bell, the Criminall Magistrate should be called to∣gether, which was immediatly done. Thus the Duke standing fort before him, Apollo him∣selfe, after he had tauntingly vpbraided him with the foule crime, whereof he stood endited; all inflamed with wrath, he told him, that he allowed him but the space of halfe an houre to defend his reputation. And in the meane time (as if that poore Princes case had beene vtterly desperate) he straitly commanded, that who∣soeuer had committed the indignitie to haue adored a ser∣uant of his, should be condemned to perpetuall infamie, as vnworthy to liue among the vertuous Princes of the Phoe∣bean Court. Then the Duke thus began his defence. Sir, and father of the vertuous; I haue so armed my conscience with the fine, and proofe-cuirace of Innocencie, and so am I assured to haue liued vertuously, and vprightly in all my actions, as I am more than certaine to haue demerited nothing of your Maiestie. Nor doth your indignation, nor this preci∣pitous doome, to see, that the dreadfull sentence of my in∣famie doth fore-goe the cognition of the cause, any iot dis∣may or confound me. Only I maruell to see, what as yet I neuer beleeued, that the foulenesse of accusations, yea among the most iust and vncorrupted Tribunals, as this is, is of power to call in que∣stion, and bring into so dangerous hazards, the reputation of men of my ranke and qualitie. But I quiet my selfe in the will of God, who hath euer willed, that the gold of others innocencie, should be refined in the fire of false calumnies, and in the test of persecutions. I freely confesse vnto your Maiestie, to haue exalted my friend more than my maleuolent enemies haue reported vnto you. And in this my action, which to your Maiestie hath beene pourtraid so hainous, this only grieueth mee, that (in mine opinion) I haue not throughly performed all that vertue of compleat gratitude, which so deare a friend hath worthily deserued at my hands. And if those who accuse me, or other Princes my equals, of prodigalitie, of dotage, or of an abiect minde, borne in the foule sinke of sottishnesse, to serue seruants, when they see a Courtier well-beloued or rewarded by his Lord or Prince, would not suffer themselues to be blinded by malice, by passion, or by enuie, but with a minde void of flegme or spleene, would impartially consi∣der the true merits of Court-fauourits, they would then name that a vertuous life, which they entitle vitious prodi∣galitie; dutie of gratitude those gifts, which they call in∣considerate; and a vertuous affection, the infamie, where∣with they charge them to dote vpon, or idolatrize Mignons: But it is not a profession fitting vulgar or ordinarie men, to diue or pierce into Abditos Principis sensus, & si quid occul∣tius parant: whence it hapneth, that the ignorant, with the infamie of great men, fall into so grosse errors, as they stile the vertuous proceeding of a gratefull man, to be a vice of an abiect minde. The Principalitie of the Laconians (as your Maiestie well knoweth) is Electiue, in which the confining Princes, haue euer beene of greater power, than he that ruled and com∣manded the same: not onely for the end and scope, com∣mon to all electiue Princes, after their death, to procure vnto their blood and kinsfolks, potent friends, but for the ad∣herences, which foraigne Princes, for important respects, haue with the Senators or Peeres, that enioy the prerogatiue to elect a new Prince: the dependance and traine of whom they endeuour to acquire, and procure with those arts and tricks, as are already too well knowne to all men. Moreouer, your Maiestie knoweth, that the Prince of Macedonia, with his plots and practises had gotten so great authoritie in my State, and was so ouer-growne in forces aboue all the Grecian Princes, as he was not only the absolute arbitrator of all Greece, but openly aspired vnto an vniuersall Mo∣narchie. Besides, it is not vnknowne to your Maiestie, that the said Prince of Macedonia, vnder colour of amitie, and the protection of the Dukes of Laconia, with vndermining pra∣ctises sought euer their ruine and ouerthrow. And forso∣much as the power of the Prince of Epirus hindred him from being able to compasse so high ends, he, to remoue, or at least, to frustrate, or to weaken so strong an obstacle, more with machinations of gold, and with secret conspiracies, than with open force of Armes, he caused those insurrecti∣ons of the people, and those rebellions in Epirus, that haue so much impaired the State thereof. And (as a thing too too well knowne to the world) I will not now call to your memories, how that my most prudent Predecessor, fore-knowing that the depression of Epirus, was a manifest preparation for the ruine of the Laconian Em∣pire; to assure the same from the ambition of so mighty an enemie, hee resolued, openly with might and maine to aide and support the afflicted State of Epirus. And how that good Prince died in the pursuit of his wise resolution, not without vehement suspition of poyson mi∣nistred vnto him by expresse order from the Prince of Ma∣cedonia; as he, who neither could, nor would endure, that the diuision of Epirus (by him accounted so secure) should be hindred by him. In this vnhappy state of things, I was aduanced to the Dignitie: And to auoid the disastrous end of my Predeces∣sor, in the first months of my Principalitie, I shewed my selfe to be of a remisse genius, and altogether incapable of great affaires of State. I did wholly apply my selfe to reforme the Magistrates of my Dominion, and correct the abuses and vices of my subiects, openly professing to be a capitall enemie to the Prince of Epirus; but in my heart, ful wel knowing wherunto the secret machinations, and plots of the Macedonian Prince aimed: and knowing also, that each losse of the Prince of Epirus, would proue my ouerthrow; I, to establish my State, reduced vnto so apparent dangers, resolued with my selfe, to afford him all the aid I could. But, to assure mine owne life for those disastrous mis∣chiefs, in which my Predecessor perished, it behoued me, in so strait and difficult a deliberation, to proceed with won∣derfull caution and secrecie. And obseruing (as no doubt your Maiestie, and all these Right Honourable Iudges know full well) that amongst the numberlesse imperfections incident vnto Electiue States, the greatest is, that, lesse than any whatsoeuer Principalities, they finde or enioy that most important, and vnualuable be∣nefit of secrecie in their Ministers: forsomuch as the cu∣stomes of men are so depraued, as their Senators and Coun∣sellors proue often greedy Merchants, or Brokers of their Dignities and Offices; out of which they labour and pra∣ctise to extract and reape the greatest commoditie, that possi∣bly they can: Now therefore, euen in the beginning of my Principalitie, seeing my selfe engaged, yea and engulfed in so many anguishes and perplexities: And knowing, that I must needs wracke, and vtterly perish vpon the rocke of Infidelitie, if in a businesse of so maine consequence, I made vse of those ordinarie Secretaries, whom I knew to haue long before fore-stalled and bribed by foraigne Princes: The great God (from whose only benignitie, and not from any else, I acknowledge this great benefit) inlightned my vnder∣standing. And hee it was, that first proposed vnto mee, this mine, I will not say seruant; for by the matchlesse vertue, which I haue found and experienced in him, he de∣serueth not to be stiled with so meane, or with so base a sur∣name, but most deare-deare friend. And to him, who in the quality of a bosome seruant, had most faithfully serued me the space of full eight yeeres, I freely vnfolded that se∣cret of my heart, which had it but falne into my imagina∣tion, I would haue deemed it most dangerous for me. And then it was, that I perceiued, how that the excellencie and high worth of a Secretarie consists not (as many thinke) in the speaking with elegancie, but in being secretly silent with fidelitie. This I say, because with so happy successe of the important businesse, which I had in hand, I vsed and im∣ployed this my trustie seruant, as I most successefully came to beguile and countermine the wilie-wise Prince of Ma∣cedonia; which no subtle or craftie wit was yet euer able to doe. And by the meanes of this my so faithfull Secretary, my affaires haue bin so carried, as no man could euer diue into, or so much as guesse at my designes. And I haue vnder∣hand aided and supported that Prince my friend, whom I openly professed to hate and persecute: and haue prospe∣rously practised the trade, at once to laugh and to deceiue, with those who make publike ostentation to bee the cano∣nicall Doctors of that Art. And with so vertuous a deceit haue I reduced the affaires of Epirus (whilome so imbroiled, as they were generally held desperate) vnto the state the world seeth. Since that from the most deplorable misery that could be, I haue raised the same to be the sole Arbitrator of all Greece. And the Macedonians, who had chimera'd and ideated vnto themselues vniuersall Monarchies; and that in lesse than a moneth they should bee able to swallow downe all other mens states: from their highest hopes are so tumbled downe into a precipice of lamentable desperations, as ha∣uing vtterly renounced their ambitious cepricios, to vsurpe other mens Estates, as with much adoe they keepe and main∣taine their owne. Apollo, hauing attentiuely listened vnto those things, all ioyfull ranne to embrace the Duke of Laconia, and with ten∣dernesse of heart said thus vnto him. Oh Duke of that thrice noble Nation, which in few words expresseth many things, right vertuously and honest∣ly hast thou dealt with a man of so incomparable worth and vertue. And I tell thee plainely, that in thy most honoura∣ble Laconian Senate, there are but few other Senatours to be found equall in merit to this thy friend, to whom hadst thou giuen all thine Estate, yet shouldest thou dye vngracefull to him, and in his debt; sith in these vnhappy times, wherein euen in the open market of the perfidiousnesse of many, the secrets of Princes are at port-sale, sold to him that offereth most. That Secretary, who in important affaires proueth faithfull, and continueth trusty vnto his Prince, cannot so highly bee honoured, nor so bountifully be rewarded by him, but that he hath deserued much much more. Apollo, bewailing the wofull wrackes, which in the Courts of great Princes, his vertuous fol∣lowers suffer, and fall into; for to assure their Nauigation, commandeth some of the chiefest learned men in his Dominion, to endeuour to frame a Sailing-card, to saile safely by land. Rag. 23. 2 Part. THE deplorable wracks, which diuers learned men so often suffer in the Courts of great Princes, grie∣uing Apollo daily more and more to the very heart, who with continuall labour and toilesome sweats, of the most famous Sciences (hoping by them to merit the good fauour and grace of Princes) hauing fraighted the Ship of their minds with them, are afterwards seene vnfor∣tunately to lose themselues on the quick-sands of a begger∣ly hired Chamber, or to sinke in the whirle-poole of some base Hospitall, and somtimes to split on some craggie rocke of beggery. No riches of infinite vertues being of force to free them from so deplorable calamities: He, I say, would needs at last endeuour to finde out some remedy for so great mis∣chiefes, whereby hee might rest assured, that in all Courts (but especially in that of Rome, placed in so tempestuous a Climate) the nauigation of his beloued vertuous attendants might be reduced vnto all possibe security; and all for the benefit of good letters, which doe much empaire their repu∣tation, when others see that they so little aduance or be∣nefit those that spend most of their best age in learning them. Now Apollo seriously discoursing with himselfe, that if the English, the Portagues, the Bretton, the Biscan, the Hollan∣der and the Zelander Pilots, onely with a little obseruing of the Starres, the Moone and the Sunne, with a little stone in their hand, could and were able to curb and command the vast and dreadfull Ocean, which they so freely, and euery way, and at all seasons furrowed and waded through, as they had thereon plotted out high-waies and watlin-streets, to∣wards and from all Coasts. How it could bee that his vertuous, with the powerfull helpe of Astronomy, of Cosmographie, of the Mathematiks, of the Meteors, but chiefly with their quaint wits, sharpned on the whetstone of continuall reading of Bookes, could not inuent as easie and secure a nauigation by land, as the Pi∣lots of the forenamed Nations had found out by sea. There∣fore to assure (as farre as the vertue and strength of good let∣ters can extend vnto) the nauigation by land. Apollo did not many moneths since institute a Congrega∣tion of men, selected out from all the Sciences necessary for so maine a businesse, appointing as chiefe and president thereof, Ptolomie, the Prince of Cosmographers, vnto whom he allotted great Aristotle, as companion in the Me∣teors, Euclide for the Mathematicks, Guido Bonatti for Astro∣nomie: And to these he added as Coadiutor, Count Bal∣tazar Castilion, a man well skil'd and practised in the bot∣tomlesse seas of the Courts. And for the better security of all that which he intended to establish for the happy successe of a businesse of so impor∣tant a consequence, his Maiestie commanded, that famous Annon of Carthage, Palinurus, Columbus, Cortese, Ferrante Magellanes, Amerigo Vespucci, Vasco di Gama should be ad∣mitted in the Congregation, as they, who haue beene the prime & chiefest Pilots that euer the nauigation by Sea had. First then (as it was conuenient) there was by that right excellent man Ptolomie, framed a most exquisite Card to saile by Land, which with singular cunning was euery way lineated. And to come to the perfect knowledge of the true eleua∣tion of the merits of Courtiers, and longitude of the re∣wards, with which their seruices should be acknowledged, there were not onely inuented diuers and most learned Astrolabs, but a new and most artificiall Quadrant. True it is that that excellent man Guido Bonatti, with all his profound Astronomie, laboured exceeding hard to finde out the true altitude of the pole of the Court of Rome; nor was it euer possible, either for him or for any other of the most sufficient of the whole Congregation, with any Astrolabe whatsoeuer, to euen or leuell and adiust the course of the Sunne of the phantasticke braine, and giddy humour of a selfe-conceited Prince. For the genius of Princes being the true and safe North-Starre, which nauigating Courtiers ought heedily to obserue in the nauigations by land. Those worthy men were much amazed, and wondred how a Starre so certaine and infallible in Sea nauigations, should in Land nauigation be found not onely vnstable and wauering, but was perpetually turned and gired about, by the two contrary motions of priuate interesse, and selfe-pas∣sion: from which two difficulties, many most dangerous turbulencies arising, they were often the causes of foule and horrible wracks. But greater difficulties and incumberances were discoue∣red in the most vncertaine motions of the wandring Stars, of the Ministers and Officers of Princes, since (as it should haue bin) they were not so much rapt by the first impetuous Mouer of the good seruice due to their Prince, vnto which they were often manifestly seene to be retrograde. And that which exceeded all wonder, was the amazement whereinto the Congregation fell, when by a certaine obser∣uation it perceiued, that the inferiour heauens of the Mini∣sters, with the course of their priuate passions towards their owne interesse or selfe-respects, did often draw and rap the said primum mobile. So that by these strange accidents, the businesse was so intricate and full of confusion, as those Lords could neuer possibly come to the perfect knowledge of the regular and true motion of so many sphears, as was necessary to those that were to publish infallible rules of them. The rubs and impediments increased when they came to the act to note and set downe the winds in the guide-ship compasse, which they found to be neither certaine, nor limited in number, as we see they are in all Sea-cards, but were little lesse than infi∣nite; for, besides the foure master winds of the Princes will, of his childrens desires, of his Brethrens prerogatiue, of o∣ther Princes of the blood's preheminence, and the seuerall opinions of priuie Councellors, there were discouered an in∣finite number of quarter-winds, or side winds, of the mini∣sters and Officers of the Court, of Mignons and Fauourits to the Prince, of vnder-Secretaries, of Buffons, of Flatte∣rers, of Parasites, of Fidlers, yea, and of Panders, all so ir∣regular, so voluble, so vnconstant, and in some occasions, so stormy, so boistrous, so high and furious, as in the compasse which they were a framing, they bred so inextricable diffi∣culties, as made those famous Pilots to condole the misera∣ble condition of nauigating Courtiers, who in their land-sailing must bee enforced to fit and adapt the sailes of their wits to such a multitude of seuerall winds as appeared vn∣to them. All which difficulties notwithstanding (though insupera∣ble) those notable Pilots neuer fainted or gaue ouer. Nay rather, though they discouered the immense and vast Ocean of the Courts to be all ouer full of flats, shelues, shallows, quicksands, crags, rocks, gulfs, whirl-pools, sirts, Scilla's and Carybdis of enuious, emulous, malicious, seditious, male∣volent, spightfull, rancorous, clamorous, turbulent, fro∣ward, skittish, and diabolicall, male-contents, detractors, back-bi ers, slanderers, railers, grudgers, persecutors, finde-faults, fantastick-humors, and heteroclit-wits, by so much the more did their courage increase to surmount so hard a taske, and so intricate a businesse, and to bring it to some good passe. Their Astrolabs being framed, and the Quadrant finished, and the Ship-guide compasse reduced vnto the best perfe∣ction they could, the Congregation determined to come vnto the act of experience, whereupon hauing made choise of eight quaint, smug, and spruce Courtiers, all compleat∣ly stored with patience (the most necessary biscuit, commo∣dious prouision, and needfull sustenance for those that haue the heart to lanch into, and furrow the tempestuous Ocean of the Courts) who, whilest they diligently prepared them∣selues for their voyage, hauing hoised their sailes, and onely expecting a fauourable wind, a chance befell impossible to be beleeued; which was, that a most propitious North-gale blowing, to which all the eight Courtiers, suddenly hoised and spread the sailes of all their hopes, onely those of one were seene to appeare full swolne, and prosperously to fol∣low his voyage, whilest the other seuen neuer budged from their stations. Which the Lords of the Congregation perceiuing, they were much distracted, especially when they obserued, that in a Land-nauigation the fauourable winds of the Princes good grace and opinion did not blow equally in all the sailes of his Courtiers, though all of equall merit and worth. And greater was their wonder, when the said fauourable winde, blowing a new faire stiffe gale, some Courtiers, who were prepared for a bon-voyage, speedily hoised, and spread all their sheeting, they might perceiue one who had neither mast, nor saile, nor tackling, of any merit, but lay there idly hulling in the hauen, to learne some practise of the Court, before he would aduenture himselfe into the dangers of so troublous and hazardous a nauigation, by the force of that propitious winde, was driuen out of the port of his restfull ease, and blowne roomeward into the deepe of manage∣ments beyond his skill or sufficiency; and with a most suc∣cesfull nauigation, end the voyage, with the purchase of great reuennues, of rich offices, of eminent honors, and of sublime titles: A nouelty that seemed so rare and strange to all the Pilots, that Mag lanes, as one confoun∣ded with wonder, said thus; My honourable good Lords, I would neuer haue belee∣ued there should bee so great a difference betweene the Sea-nauigation, and the Land-sailing. And these extrauagant nouelties which now I see, seeme so strange to me, as they make me greatly to doubt of any happy issue of this our enterprise. But, for as much as all arduous difficulties may at last bee ouercome with a constant patience in the pursuit of them, let vs boldly proceed. By this time another right vertuous Courtier, displaied the sailes of his faithfull seruice, at a faire westerly gale of the good fauour of his Prince, and by the quality of the sailes full puft, with the gracious demonstrations of words, which he receiued from his Lord, imagining that he had gone a far iourney, after a long-long voyage, hauing calculated the course of his nauigation, hee found himselfe riding at An∣chor in the very same place, whence hee hoised saile in the long voyage of his assiduous seruice: The silly and vnhap∣py wretch, hauing continually bin fed with diuers hopes of fallacious expectations, without substance of any good. But a stranger accident presented it selfe vnto those Lords, when they saw at one same instant a stiffe gust to blow both South and North so ragingly, from the adle braine of a fan∣tasticke Prince, that the vnfortunate Courtiers, tossed to & fro by two so contrary winds, could not resolue to which they were best to addresse their sailes, so that diuers vertu∣ous good men perished in that tempestuous storme. At which strange case Celumbus exclaimed and said; Now I plainly perceiue (my Lords) that the nauigation by Sea, wherein these extrauagances are neuer seene, is a businesse so safe, as it may be compared vnto such iournies as men go by land in Horse-litters Columbus had no sooner vttred these words, but the Lords of the Congregation perceiued, that certaine right vertuous Courtiers, who rode in the hauen, were in great danger to be cast away; the Sea of the Court wrought so, and was beyond it's custome so risen, and the surges mounted so high, as they threatned a generall nau∣frage. The biggest Cables of the most exquisite Court-pa∣tience, although right strong and tough, did rend in sunder; so that all was wrackfull ruine. All which notwithstanding the skie of the Princes countenance was calme, and his as∣pect cleare, nor did any other winde blow, but the gentle Zephirus, or West of the Princes quietnesse. The mischiefe was apparent; the breath of the Princes indignation was not felt, and yet the miserable nauigating Courtiers perished in the harbour All this raging storme notwithstanding, an hardy and couragious Courtier, who dared to heaue Anchor, & come out of the hauen; and (as euery man thought) was not only nor drowned nor ouerwhelmed; for, that blustring tempest which would haue endangered or wrack't any whatsoeuer best practis'd and skilfull Sea-man, serued him in steed of so prosperous a gale, as in a short time it brought him vnto an hauen of high and honourable dignities. An accident (in truth) worthy of infinite admiration, and which caused great wonderment and amazement in all the Lords of the Congregation. It seeming very strang vnto them, that in the Land nauigation, those stormy tem∣pests serued some in lieu of fauonrable winds, which in most safe and quiet hauens were the dismall destruction of many. But another thing seemed more wondrous vnto them, when in a calme skie, cleare welkin, and faire season; no clouds, no lightning, no thunder, nor any signe of foule weather appearing, there were suddenly seene certaine thun∣der-bolts to fall, which vtterly consumed and burnt two most vnfortunate Courtiers. At which vnwonted accident, the Lords of the Congregation were much affrighted, won∣dring how the thunder-darts, hurled by an irefull Prince, were not accompanied with those fore-going Lightning-flashes and thunder-claps, as those be, which by the All-powerfull hand of the great God are hurled at Mankind, and which forewarne all Courtiers to auoid them. A little while after, they saw a Courtier assailed by an out∣ragious storme of persecutions; who after he had long strug∣led, and stoutly defended himselfe against the muddie fury of the swolne Sea of his Princes wrathfull indignation, and from the furious blasts of cruell and malicious detractions, lest he should sinke and be swallowed vp, hee was forced to fling all his goods and merchandize ouer-board. And the miserable wretch had already lost the maine mast of his hopes, and his merits had a great leake, and drew in abun∣dance of water of desperation, when loe his vessell rushed and split against the marble rock of the ingratitude of a most vnthankfull Prince. Then followed a most strange thing, which was, that af∣ter so disastrous an encounter, the vessell of that Courtiers seruice being split, wrackt and sunke, the storme of Court-persecutions ceased, the Sea of the Princes indignation was calmed, and the rocke (which had caused that miserable wracke) was conuerted into a most safe hauen: the Courtiers vessell but ere-while ouerwhelmed, of it selfe start vp out of the waues, more faire, more strong, and in better plight, than euer it had beene before. And the merchandize of his merits of it selfe was laded againe, which not long after, he vttered and vented at a very deare rate; trucking and chan∣ging the same for great dignities, eminent titles, and rich reuenues. This accident seemed very strange vnto the Lords Pilots, and vnto all the Congregation, nor could they sufficiently wonder how it could be possible, that in the land-nauigation the most vnhappie wrackes of some, might serue as great fe∣licities to others. Now the Congregation continuing in trying of new ex∣periments, enioyned a sly-witty Courtier to hoise and dis∣play the sailes of his talent towards a wind that blew from South, and happily sailing, and keeping towards the North, after many dayes sayling the Pilot-courtier desirous to see where he was, he with his Astrolabe measured the altitude of the Pole of his merit; and to his great wonderment found, that hauing continually kept the prow of his faithfull ser∣uice towards the North of his Princes interresse, hee had made his voyage Southward. Of so strange a disorder, the Courtier at first accused himselfe, that (as hee should haue done) he had not steered the helme of his faithfull minde to∣wards the North of his Princes good seruice. But when both with his sailing-card, and with his ship-guide compasse in his hand, he assured himselfe, that he had euermore guided the ship of his actions in an euen and honest line, he plainly per∣ceiued, that the errour or mistaking of his vnluckie voyage proceeded so, because the North of his Princes affection had suffered it selfe to to be turned towards the South, by certain wicked and maleuolent whisperers, which he hath alwaies about him. Then Vespucci, Gama, and other Pilots, besought the Lords of the Congregation, to giue ouer the businesse, as a desperate cure: and said, that nothing yeelded the nauigati∣on by sea more sure or safe, than the immutabilitie of the North-starre. And that by the last most vnfortunate experience, it ha∣uing euidently appeared, that the mindes of Princes (which are the infallible North-starre of land-nauigation) suffering themselues so often and so easily to be turned, remoued, and circumgired by lewd and wicked people of the Court: to aduenture to saile the tempestuous Ocean of the Courts, was a resolution not fitting wise men, but desperate persons. In this interim the Lords of the Congregation might see a most elegant spruce Courtier, who for the space of more than threescore yeares had so happily sailed, both in the Court of Rome, and in others, that he had not only surmoun∣ted outragious storms of ruthlesse blasts and boistrous winds of persecutions, but had euen shiuered and broken the very same huge rocks, on which he had split & wrackt his vessel; but that afterwards, when with a most pleasant gale, and pro∣sperous wind, on the height of his felicitie, he pursued his course, onely for that he vnfortunately hit vpon a rush of an impertinencie of a base Catch-pole, he was vtterly cast away. An accident which caused such distraction in the Congrega∣tion, that the Lords ioyntly resolued, to haue but one triall more made (and then be quiet) by a Courtier, that was rea∣die to set saile; and him they commanded to hoise and spread all his sailes: But so it happened, that whilest he held on his course in a coast, deemed of all men, most safe and dan∣gerlesse, his ship vnheedily, or by chance, hit vpon a rocke, and was wholly split and wrackt, which the Lords of the Congregation seeing, they all bitterly bewailed the igno∣rance and vnheedinesse of the Courtier; for so much as hee could not auoid that rocke. But he made manifest demon∣stration to them all, that it was not marked in the sailing-card. Whereupon all the Pilots casting their eyes vpon great Pto∣lomey, as if they silently accused him of ignorance, hauing omitted that rocke, which so well deserued to be marked in his Card, and had been the cause of so disastrous a mischiefe. But Ptolomey hauing first well viewed the place, and consi∣dered the countrey thereabout, did euidently demonstrate vnto the Lords, that no man liuing had euer before that time seene any shelfe or rocke in that place, and therefore he had not marked it in his Card; but that it suddenly grew and started vp in the very instant, that the vpfortunate Courtier hit and ranne vpon it. Now the Lords of the Congregation perceiuing, that in the nauigation by land, huge rockes did euery hand-while spring vp and grow in a moment, euen in the middest of fields and other places supposed most safe to be nauigated in the darkest night, they concluded their businesse to bee des∣perate, and their attempt impossible. And therefore dismis∣sing the Congregation, they straitly commanded, that in the perillous Land-nauigation, no man should dare to goe a iourney, except at high noone, and withall, euery man should carry a great Lanterne of wisdome, with a burning Taper therein in the prow of his proceeding; morning and eue∣ning with his bare knees on the ground, and hands heaued vp to heauen, humbly beseeching the Maiesty of the euer∣liuing God, to send them good successe, since that for one to bring the Ship of his hopes into a Court, as into a safe heauen, doth rather depend from the immediate aide and as∣sistance of God, than from any humane wisdome what∣soeuer. The Lord Iohn de la Casa, hauing presented his quaint Galateo, or booke of Manners vnto A∣pollo, meeteth with great difficulties in diuers Nations, about their promises to obserue the same. Rag. 28. 1 Part. THE Right Reuerend Lord, Iohn de la Casa, who (as wee wrote vnto you by our last) was with great solemnity admitted into Parnassus, where after he had visited these illustrious Poets, and complemen∣ted with all the learned Princes of this Court, hee presented his right quaint and profitable Booke of Galateo vnto Apol∣lo, which his Maiestie did so highly commend, that imme∣diately, he strictly commanded, it should inuiolably be ob∣serued by all Nations: And at the same instant enioyned the said Lord to compose a Galatea, since it was manifestly knowne, that the Ladies of these moderne times, haue as much need to be corrected in their euill and depraued man∣ners, as men. Which Edict caused great alteration in the people subiect vnto Apollo 's dominion: For, it was neuer possible, neither by entreaties, nor by menaces, to induce the Marquesans to be pleased to receiue it; and they boldly protested, that they were rather resolued to renounce their Countrey, and forsake their children, than to leaue their most laudable custome, to honour their Lords and Masters with all sincerity of heart: to loue their friends with purity of af∣fection▪ rather than with lou ing coursies, and with such other Court-ceremonies learn'd by rote. There were also found greater difficulties among Princes, because the most mighty Monarchie of France would neuer subiect it selfe to the nice obseruations of the strict rules of Galateo, Nisi si, & in quantum, her owne tast and liking did accord vnto, which (she said boldly) she would rather attend, than on affected faire creances, which she should neuer ob∣serue but with a certaine outward apparence. The Soueraigne Monarchie of Spaine swore solemnely, that she would submit her selfe vnto Galateo 's rules, on con∣dition the Lord De la Casa would remoue but one Chapter out of it, which was, that being at a Table with other Prin∣ces, shee would not haue it counted ill manners in her, if seeing a good morsell in her companions dish, she did pre∣sently lay hold on it, and conuey the same vpon her owne trenchar. Moreouer shee would not be noted to be ouer-gluttonous, if by chance shee should eat and deuoure all her neighbours part. The Venetian Magnificoes affirmed, that they would willingly allow of Galateo, prouided alwaies that the Lord De la Casa would declare therein, that with all diligence to pry into, and seek to know other mens matters, businesses, and secrets, was no point of ill manners, but a ne∣cessary point of State-policy. Then all the Princes of Italy applauded and embraced Galateo, onely they said, that without being accounted vn∣mannerly, they would bee allowed to chew on both sides. But the Dutch mutined, and were like to cause some hurly-burly: for they did not onely vtterly refuse to binde them∣selues to the Italian sobricty in drinking, but did obstinately require, that it should be enacted and recorded in Galateo, that the Dutchmens excessiue quaffing, and continuall be∣ing drunken, and Cup-shotten, was one of the chiefest ver∣tues could be found in men of their Nation, and one of the first requisits that Princes and Common-wealths, for the safety and welfare of their States, could wish for, or desire in their Subiects, which request of theirs was by all the learned of Parnassus reiected and impugned, as impertinent and abominable. And therefore touching that particular of sobriety in drinking, the Dutch were earnestly intreated and ex∣horted to submit themselues vnto the rules of Gala∣teo, since that by reason of their custome of immoderate bib∣bing, and so often being fox't, they were by the best Nati∣ons of Europe pointed at as gazing-stocks. To these obiections the Dutchmen answered stoutly, that those sober men deserued rightly to be stiled foul drunkards, who liuing vnder the bondage and seruitude of Princes, by the phantasticke humour, or toyish conceit of one man, strangely passionate and giddy headed, they were daily in∣sulted vpon, oppressed, hurried, and extortioned in liues, lands, and goods: And that those drunken Germanes should bee reputed perfectly sober, who had the wit to vindicate themselues; and had likewise the heart and grace to main∣taine themselues in liberty: adding moreouer, that they ac∣counted them bedlam fooles, who did not beleeue, that the drunkennesse of the Germane people was the true foundati∣on and establishment of so many famous Republiks as were now seene among them. For the safety of a State, and the vniuersall peace of the people, depending onely on the fi∣delity of the ministers of Princes and Republiks, and on the well-meaning plainnesse and sincerity of euery mans mind: what other more precious iewell could bee desired in the world, then continually to see in Germany by vertue of ex∣cessiue quaffing of Wine, to vomit forth the inwardest se∣crets and most hidden cogitations of the minds of men. The Germanes added moreouer, that by long experience they had plainly discouered, that they did most exquisitely well aduise & counsell their countrey, who by means of the good store of wine that they had drunke, hauing therein drowned all priuate interesses, and smothered all foule dis∣simulation, which sobriety is wont to beget in others minds; the open-hearted Dutch spake alwaies with a single free heart, and not as the Italians, and other Nations, yea, the sobrest are commonly wont, onely with their mouth, ordi∣narily full of guile and leasings. They said likewise, that so ambitiously affecting the glo∣rious name of braue men at armes, as was well knowne to all the world, they could not with patience listen vnto the counsels and deliberations of sober men, who are common∣ly full of timidity, and of a vicious circumspection, vailed with the man le of prudence; but because they would haue them to be generous and couragious, they would not allow, that any man should vndertake to counsell his Countrey be∣ing fasting, but after hee had first swilled downe good store of grape-liquor, and enflamed his heart with generosity, it being the proper quality of good wine rather to expell timi∣dity from the heart, than remoue iudgement from the vn∣derstanding. And therefore the Germanes with great reason, De recon∣ciliandis inuicem inimicis, & iungendis affinitatibus, & adsci∣scendis Principibus, de pace denique ac bello, plerumque in con∣uiuijs consuitant, tanquam nullo magis tempore ad simplices co∣gitationes pateat animus, aut ad magnas incalescat. Furthermore they said, That if the Italian vicious sobriety were introduced among the Germanes, that most faithfull and sincere Nation, would therewithall begin to abound with those double hearts, false minds, secret thoughts, vn∣seene sleights, handy-dandy, or turne-coat spirits, fraught with treasons, treacheries, conspiracies, and machinations, full of vntrue and forged affections, masked with secret ha∣tred, with faigned and dissembled friendship, and with all manner of foisting, whereof those Nations that glory to be sober are most abundant Cicilies and fruitfull Egypts, a thing so true, that the French, who for the vnspottednesse and pu∣rity of their free and single hearted minds, in the excellent vertue to be euer most faithfull & loyall to their Kings, haue at all times bin most glorious and renowmed in the world, since diuers of them haue left the most commendable cu∣stome to quaffe merily, and to bee drunken after the good Dutch fashion, haue suffered themselues to bee drawne into those most felonious actions that the world knowes full well. And if that little window in a mans breast, was by the wisest of former ages deemed a thing so necessary, and esteemed as an vnualuable benefit vnto mankinde, because through it a man might visibly see and view the hearts of certaine slie cunny catching companions, who, within be∣ing most vgly deuils, imploy the vtmost of their endeauours to bee reputed faire Angels; With what ground of good reason can any man blame the right laudable and precious custome to quaffe merily, and to be drunke? it being most palpable and euident, that drinking of much wine hath the vertue to make bodies diaphaned or transparent. For which solid reasons, which by Apollo were both allowed and com∣mended for militant, it was resolued, that concerning the particular point of drinking moderately and soberly, the excellent and farre renowmed Dutch Nation should not bee subiect vnto the strict precepts of Galateo. The vse of drunkennesse being among the Germanes ra∣ther an artifice of the Publike, than a vice of priuate men; It being manifestly knowne, that both in times of peace and of warre, those nations are best aduised that doe as the Ger∣mans; Deliberant, dum fingere nesciunt: constituunt, dum errare non possunt. Apollo hauing highly commended the Statute, made by the most mighty Kings of Spaine, that no Aduocates, Lawyers, or Proctors shall passe into the Indies, the Doctors of the Law finding themselues aggrieued, complaine vnto his Ma∣jestie. Rag. 83. 1 Part. THe renowmed Court and habitation of Parnassus may rightly be esteemed most happy, not so much for the right excellent gouernment of Apollo's Maiestie, nor because it is inhabited by the most quaint, flouri∣shing, choise, and sublime wits of the whole vniuerse, as be∣cause the exquisitenesse of a vertuous life, the perfection of all right honourable customes, and the exactnesse of all the best lawes dispersed through the whole world, are therein with all precise diligence introduced, propagated, cherished and obserued. The reason is, because those that inhabit or reside there, are bound to bring the most commendable fa∣shions of their Countries. A custome, that hath brought so great commoditie vnto the Priuate, and so honourable reputation vnto the Publike, as all men may euidently perceiue, that to be a right blessed and happy country, which liueth and subsisteth, not so much by her owne proper lawes, as by and with those iudiciously selected from out all other most ciuill and best established Nations. Apollo hauing lately bin informed, how the most potent Kings of Spaine, hauing vnder great penalties prohibited, that no Aduocates, no Lawyers, nor Proctors shall passe into the Indies, was pleased to approue and ratifie the said Decree as most wholsome, as most holy. And did highly extoll and commend the piety of those Monarks, who shewed so great charitie towards the new world, in seeking to preserue it from that mischieuous infection, that hath filled and infe∣cted the old-one with so many deplorable calamities and wailfull controuersies. Whereupon his Maiestie comman∣ded, that the said holy and excellent Edict should forthwith be engrauen, and enregistred in a faire table of metall, which to the perpetuall memorie thereof should be affixed neere vnto the twelue Tables of the most famous Romane Lawes in Forum maximum. We must not omit to let you vnder∣stand, that the Doctors of the Lawes were greatly moued and vexed at this iniunction, who earnestly recommended the indemnitie of their reputation vnto his Maiestie, allea∣ging, that if they should not obtaine the fauour to haue the publication of that ordinance staied, occasion would be gi∣uen vnto many to imitate those of Ancona, of Norcia, of Re∣canati, and of other people, who to the great dishonour of good letters, had chased and expelled from out all their counsels and consultations those Pettie-foggers and Law-pleaders, which of all other people were held in so great ad∣miration; for they verily beleeued, that without the PLACET of a man skilfull in the Law, it was impossible for any man to say or doe any thing well or honestly. And that by so much the more, they besought his Maiestie to take their cause into his consideration, as there was question made of the indemnitie of the thrice-sacred Liberall Arts, which all Students of the Lawes, to their intolerable costs and charges, and with vnspeakable toyle, labour and sweat, did waste and consume themselues to learne. At whose strange instances, Apollo (against the opinion of all the by-standers) fell into a chafing passion, and with great indignation, answered those malapert Doctors, that hee much wondred, how before his Maiesties sacred pre∣sence, they had dared to affirme, that they spent, and labou∣red, and sweat so much to learne the sacred Liberall Arts, as if the Delphick Edict were not knowne to all the world, in which the studie of the Lawes is especially declared to be no Liberall Science, but a base trade, and a mechanicall occupa∣tion, brought into the world for the affliction of mankinde, studied and plodded vpon without any delectation to the minde, without any speculation of the intellect, and without the so materially-needfull helpe of the soueraigne Muses in all perfect and commendable Sciences; and only exercised for meere couetousnesse of lucre, to fatten with pelfe and crownes a peece of man with two gloting eies in his skonce, or a slouenly fellow, who although he be altogether void of that viuacitie of wit, which good and noble letters affect so much, neuerthelesse, to become an eminent Aduocate, it sufficeth him to haue a blockish braine, a porter-like grosse complexion, a rusticall behauiour, and a clownish demea∣nour, fit rather to draw in a cart, than to conuerse with ciuill or learned men. An Apothecarie, at the very instant, that he is taken prisoner by Sergeants, without being examined at all, is forthwith condemned and sent to the Gallies. Rag. 65. 2 Part. THe Apothecarie that dwelt at the signe of the two Crownes in the high Mercerie-street, was foure daies since apprehended by the Officers of the Criminall Court: and forsomuch as the poore wretch was suddenly hood-winkt, and muffled, and on mens shoulders carried to the hauen, and put into a Gallie, all Parnassus rested much amazed, to see the execution of that vnfortunate mans con∣demnation, foregoe the framing of his enditement. It is reported, that this hath hapned at the instant re∣quest of all the chiefe Monarks of the vniuerse, now re∣sident in this State, who thinke themselues offended to the quicke by that Apothecarie, forsomuch as hee did openly sell Fine smoake: a merchandise, which Princes challenge and pretend to belong onely to them; and that no priuate person whatsoeuer should dare to sell but they. Some suppose, that by the example of that vnfortunate wretch they haue gone about to terrifie all others from trou∣bling them in matters concerning their iurisdiction and prerogatiue. And although the shallow-headed and sim∣ple sort of people giue out, that the Apothecaries fault deserued not so rigorous a resentment, yet those that will prie and thorowly diue into the secrets and interesses of great Princes, affirme, that he hath very gently, and with much indulgence beene dealt withall. Forsomuch as Fine smoake, seruing Princes (in many and daily occasions) in lieu of fine coyned gold, euery treasure of theirs (though neuer so rich and great) would soone be exhausted, when∣soeuer that so currant money of Fine smoake, losing its credit and esteeme among the vulgar sort of people; Princes should ere long bee enforced (according to the Plebeian fashion) to pay their debts with ready money. The vertuous people of Apollo's State hauing consigned vnto his Maiesties Generall Treasu∣rer the accustomed Donatiue of a thousand conceits, according to their custome they beg a boone or grace at his hands. Rag. 81. 2 Part. THose that haue exact knowledge of the passages of this State, know full well that the vertuous of Par∣nassus pay duly vnto the Exchequer-Chamber, not only the tenth part of the fruits of their wits, but the quit∣rent taxed according to each mans talent: whence it is, that fertile Ouid doth yearely pay vnto the publike Receiuers eight Elegies; Virgil fourescore printed Heroicke verses; Horace fiue Odes; Martiall eleuen Epigrams; and so others according to their sessment or taxation. Besides that, the vertuous euery three yeares vnder the name of a Donatiue or free gift (yet such a Donatiue, as if it be not paid with a genuine good will, without losing its mo∣dest name, it may be exacted, distrained, and leuied by Bai∣liffs and Sargeants, who may distraine goods, take pawnes, and sell them at Port-sale) pay into the Delphick treasurie a million of conceits, which by the soueraigne Muses are afterwards liberally distributed among those sillie Li∣terates and poore Schollers, who being depriued of all munition, onely for the loue and good will they shew to∣wards good letters, yeeld themselues worthy to bee re∣leeued. And the custome is, that vpon the occasion of so large a Donatiue, his Maiestie is euer wont to counter-change the bounteous liberalitie of his Vertuous with some sutes or fauours, which the learned may lawfully demand and chal∣lenge. So that the last weeke, after the collection of the Dona∣tiue, in a generall Congregation, the vertuous concluded to beg six graces at Apollo's hands, all which were set downe in a note or memoriall, that should be presented to him, when as the quaint Classis or wittie forme of the Politike-vertuous aduertised the Congregation, that in the occasions of begging sutes, boones, or graces from Princes for any merit a man may pretend, it was necessarie to auoid the error of demanding ouer many things at once, not only because the multitude of graces which Sutors crau , doe distaste and molest Princes, who commonly are easily distasted vpon occasions to pay bonds or duties; but because hee that beggeth pluralitie of requests, is commonly answe∣red and satisfied with the slightest and worst of them: And therefore it would proue a wise resolution, in such a case, to bee very earnest and circumspect for the obtai∣ning of one onely good sute. Alwaies prouided it bee of good worth and consequence, and which without a note of much ingratitude may not be refused or denied by the Prince. This aduertisement of the Polititians, was by the genera∣litie of the Vertuous, applauded, commended and followed. Whereupon the very next day, there were sent vnto his Maiestie the Right Excellent Bernardino Viperio, and Tiberio Serpentino, both Aduocates for the Vniuersitie of the Vertu∣ous, who hauing tendred and presented the Donatiue vnto Apollo, they most humbly besought him, that in prouiding of Iudges for his Tribunals, and of other officers for pub∣like Magistrates, he would be pleased to make choise of men of milde and gentle natures, of a courteous and affable ge∣nius, of a plausible disposition, of a meeke and lowly dexte∣ritie, of easie accesse, of a quicke vnderstanding, of a nimble apprehension, of a temperate patience, of a tractable con∣uersation, and of a cheerfull aspect. And that it might stand with his good pleasure to send certaine eteroclit, irregular, arrogant, fantastick, wayward, peeuish, insolent, passionate, self-conceited, humorous, proud, giddie-headed, and fouly tainted Animals, who with their vntuned, vnde linable, vnsetled, and distempered Calfe-braines put wretched su∣tors, and miserable Clients into greater troubles, and more harmfull agonies, than the processes, or please themselues, and appoint them to be Botesons, Masters-mates, and Au∣ditors in the Gallies, there to employ, and exercise their tur∣bulent, seditious, litigious, mutinous, harsh, and quarrelous talent vpon the Ging, Swabbers, and Rowing-slaues, which is, and proues so insupportable to free men. By letters intercepted, and taken from a Currier, dispatched by some Princes to the Lake of Auerno, the common people come to know, that the rancors and hatreds now raigning among diuers Nations, are occasioned and stir∣red vp by the artifices of their Princes. Rag. 58. 2 Part. BEtweene the confines of Pindo and Libetrum, on Monday night last, was an extraordinarie Poste rob'd, whom certaine mighty Princes had in great diligence dispatched towards the Lake Auerno. And forsomuch as the Currier had no hurt done him in his bodie; it is suspected, that the robbery hath beene committed to none other end, than to seize on his letters, as indeed it followed: for they onely tooke a packet from him, which he had about him, directed to the Infernall Fu∣ries, Alecto, Thesifon and Megera, by which letters (and truly with great scandall) it hath beene disconered, that certaine Princes doe wage and stipend the said Furies, to the end, that not onely among diuers Nations, but often among the subiects of one same Prince, they may sowe and nourish perpetuall strifes, and neuer-ending discords. And to fill vp the measure of distastes, there was a letter found in the said packet, of ten thousand duckats, to bee paied them for the arrerages of six moneths past. The subiects of those Princes, that haue written the letters, by their De∣puties haue caused them to be presented vnto Apollo, to whom they haue grieuously exclaimed, and bitterly com∣plained, that their Princes, who ought vigilantly to heed nothing so much, as the perpetuall peace and vnanimous concord, not only of their owne particular subiects, but of all other Nations besides, should with ready money pur∣chase editions to others, and mischiefes to themselues. And that vntill now, they neuer came to the knowledge, how by the meere artifices, tricks, plots, and machina∣tions of Princes, those diuisions, factions, grudges, vnkindnesses, distasts, discords, and vnnaturall hatreds, were seene so to abound among diuers Nations; and to bee the source and root of those calamitous and in∣finite mischiefes, that so much oppresse and afflict man∣kinde. All outrages, excesses, abuses, and pollutions of that nature, as if they were once cleane rooted out of the world, men might securely enioy the comfort, to see the French loue the English, the Spaniard affect the French, and the Dutch embrace the Italian, and see a perfect peace and good concord to follow betweene all men. Whilst these Deputies were thus discoursing, it was ob∣serued that from Apollo's eyes, through the great compun∣ction of what he heard, there gushed forth abundance of sad teares. Whereupon the by standers supposed verily, that his Maiestie would in raging passion burst forth into some bitter termes against those Princes, that were charged and accused of so hainous crimes, when thus he said: Oh you my faithfull friends, your complaints are as grieuous, as they be true; but know, that the enormities whereof you complaine, proceed not so much from the bad or waiward nature of Princes, as they are occasioned by the turbulent humors and seditious deuises of the peeuish peo∣ple, who with their sicklenesse and instabilitie doe so worke, as it is impossible to purchase and obtaine the vniuer∣sall peace of mankind with any other instrument, than with sowing those discords, diuisions, seditions, and fa∣ctions among Nations, whereof you so much, and so grieuously complaine: for long experience hath made Princes to know, that the huge and vnweldie machine of raigning securely, is all built and reared vpon the firme foundation of equally-contributing and iustly-distributing. And it is a thing most manifest, that the people without Princes to sway and gouerne them, would of themselues precipitate into more cruell seditions and bloudy quarrels, than those, which for the publike peace, and generall good of all, others sowe and breed among them. All mischiefs (oh you my most beloued) very necessarie. Although it grieuously grieueth mee to see, that the infirmitie of those vniuersall iarrings, and discords, which now reigne in mankinde cannot be cured with any more soueraigne remedy, and ready antidote, than with the bitter medicine, which you say is now so nastie vnto you. Antonio Perez of Aragon, hauing presented the Booke of his Relations vnto Apollo, his Ma∣iesty doth not onely refuse to accept it, but com∣mandeth the same to be presently burnt. Rag. 60. 2. Part. ANtonio Perez, whilom principall Secretary to the most mighty King of Spaine, Philip the second, knowing the bad opinion that that Secretary pur∣chaseth vnto himselfe among all Nations, who with distaste parteth from his Prince; within a while after he had recouered himselfe in France, for his owne discharge, pub∣lished vnto the world those his vnhappy Relations, which haue so heauily laden him with infamy and blame. For, whilest he with all manner of art and skill should haue pro∣cured to conceale them, vpon Thursday morning last, da∣red to present them to Apollo; who, as soone as hee saw the Booke, and was informed of the contents thereof, fell into such indignation against him, that euen then hee caused the same to be burnt in the publike & chiefe Market-place, and said vnto Perez, That he had giuen vnto his Relations that place in Parnassus which he and they deserued. And that to the end other Secretaries, his equals, might take example, and learne to preferre secrecie, and faithfulnesse of silence before the charity to ones proper life itselfe; yea, and be∣fore the loue of a mans owne selfe: for, euen as he deserueth the name of a treacherous and proditorious villaine, that vp∣on any casuall distaste, or conceiued vnkindnesse, reuealeth the secrets committed to his trust in times of former friend∣ship; so a thousand times most shamefull, infamous, and euer to bee detested is that Secretary, who for whatsoeuer hard vsage he may haue receiued from his Prince, publisheth those secrets which by his Lord and Master haue beene im∣parted vnto him in forepassed confidence, not onely volun∣tarily, much lesse by any kinde of cruell racke or sharpe tor∣ture, ought neuer to be published or disclosed to any crea∣ture whatsoeuer. The Monarchie of Spaine is much agrieued, that her falshoods and treacheries are discouered. Rag. 2. 3 Part. IT is not yet well knowne, whether it were by chance, or by the malice of some Frenchmen, or (as many haue vehemently suspected) by the machination of that Na∣tion, which is so implacable an enemy vnto the French, some few yeares since, a fire tooke hold of the Royall Palace of the Monarchie of France; and so great was the flame, and so dreadfull the blaze, that the neighbouring Monarchies entred into feareful suspition, that so huge a fire could hard∣ly be quenched, but with the ruine of their states: so that euery man, for the safety of his owne, ranne speedily to quench the fire in an others house. The English, albeit na∣turall enemies vnto the French, with all diligence brought thither the waters of their Thames. The Germanes, those of Mose and Rhine. The Venetians did in a manner empty all their Fennes and Marishes. The prudent Dukes of Tus∣canie, in great haste ran with all sorts of weapons, to helpe to extinguish that consuming flame, which wise men greatly feared, was likely to end in an vniuersall desolation. And truely it was wondrous strange to see that the Mo∣narchy of Spaine, knowne to be so deadly an enemy vnto the French, shee also among the chiefe friends of France la∣boured with might and maine to extinquish that fire, at which most men supposed, that she would rather run merily to warme her selfe, whereat all men stood amazed, especially when they saw, that shee with all solicitude, and externall charity brought vnto it, not onely the waters of her golden Tagus and Iberus, but also of the vast Ocean, of which when the English and the Hollanders please, shee is absolute Mistris. Since those Politicians sinisterly interpreting the Spani∣ards charity, declared publikely, that it was a most pernici∣ous thing in the necessities of the French, to admit the aides of those Spaniards, who being knowne to be eternall foes, & capitall enemies vnto France, ought rather to be esteemed the Architects of the vtter ruine of the French, than zealous of the greatnesse and prosperitie of their kingdome: as they who measuring all the Actions and proceedings of those which reigne among Princes, by the onely compasse of pri∣uate interesse, doe seldome admit any manner of piety to∣wards God, much lesse of charity towards men. And so much the more were such Polititians become abo∣minable to most Nations, as it manifestly appeares, that the Spaniards in their forwardnesse, diligence, and charity, to bring water vnto that fire, did not equall onely, but exceed whatsoeuer best friend vnto the French. And that which increased the wonder, and that among the simpler sort, cau∣sed great reputation vnto the Monarchy of Spaine, was, that Flanders and Austria her ancient Patrimonies, burning in a most cruell combustion of warre, she had preferred the wel∣fare and safety of the French, before the charity of her owne preseruation. But for so much as no humane endeuour, nor store of water was sufficient to quench the least sparkle of so fright∣full a fire: And that notwithstanding all the diligence and remedies that were vsed, the deuouring flames of those most fierce and bloody ciuill warres, increasing daily more and more, the wel-meaning and best affected simpler sort of men began to listen vnto the Polititians aduertisements, and to suspect, that the charity of the Spanish Monarchy was al∣together priuate interesse, and peculiar Spanish charity; which made them resolue, no longer to giue credit vnto outward apparences, but inwardly to view what matter the Spaniards brought in their Caske, and found, that in lieu of water to quench fire, they had filled them with pitch, tarre, rosen, oile, and turpentine, and also with diabolicall dissen∣tions to foment and increase the same. Which treachery was likewise found to bee fauoured by certaine French Ba∣rons, who more than others professing to bee charitable, made vse both of the barrels, and of the matter lent them by the Spaniards. Whereupon they were by the iust disdaine of the French Monarchy presently put to death, and burnt in the very same flames, which with so great sedition, and treacherous infidelitie, they nourished in the heart of their owne Countrey. And the Spaniards were not only chased from that worke, but by sound of Trumpet publikely proclaimed to be a com∣pany of false hearted hypocrites. And by an especiall Edict of the French Monarchy, all men were giuen to vnderstand, that if euer there were any man found that would beleeue, that any sparke of charity towards the French could lodge in the breast of a Spaniard, he should be held, esteemed, and reputed an egregious Gull. And that if after the first warning he should persist in his errour, he should be tossed in a blanket, as a factious and se∣ditious fellow. It was a thing worthy of admiration to see, that so soone as the Spaniards and the foresaid vnnaturall French gaue ouer their worke, that fire which before was so great, that the most iudicious doe affirme, it was in all humane reason inextinguible, on a sudden ceased of it selfe: Whereupon the eternall and farre renowmed Flower de Luces, whilom so hurried and trampled vnder foot, sprung vp againe, more gloriously flourishing and resplendent than euer they were. And France, which through the immoderate ambition of some turbulent spirits, had most barbarously bin tormen∣ted and molested more than full forty years, to the great won∣derment of all, in the twinkling of an eye became quiet and in peace. Whereby all the world came to know, that the Spani∣ards had beene the first Authors of that euer deplorable French combustion, which they vnder most specious shewes and pretences of Religion, and christian Charity, had labou∣red to make the world beleeue that they sought to quench. Some report that the Spanish Monarchy vpon this retired her selfe into her royall Palace, and that for many daies, shee would not admit any body to see her, hauing giuen her selfe ouer vnto so great melancholy, that with floods of teares trilling downe her blubred cheeks, shee loudly exclaimed, that shee would much rather haue lost two of her best king∣domes, than to see those her holy and hypocriticall pretexts so scoft at, so derided, and so laid open to all the world, wherewith she remembred to haue diuers times (to her infi∣nite profit) sold vnto the world most stinking Assa-fetid , in stead of Muske, Ziuet, and Amber-greece: It seeming vnto her to be depriued of her richest treasure, and to haue lost her inexhaust mynes of gold and siluer in Peru, yea, and of the new world besides, seeing her selfe so vnluckily de∣priued of the hope and benefit, to be at any time more able to depaint vnto the silly credulous people, white for blacke, or chalke for cheese; deeming it a very hard case to see her∣selfe brought vnto the wretched and dreadfull condition, in which she hath euer seene the French, to be inforced to pur∣chase kingdomes and dominions with the onely force of the point and dint of the Sword; and not as heretofore she hath done with the onely semblances of her false-holy pretexts, which haue sometimes stood her in stead of flourishing and strong Armies. She knowes that she hath put the world in∣to combustion, and hath euer loued to fish in troubled waters. And it grieueth her beyond measure, that she hath so lost the good opinion of most Nations, that shee is in some dan∣ger that none will hereafter beleeue her though she chance to speake the truth; whereas heretofore the stimulation of false pretexts, and of most apparent hypocrisie were held in credit, and in lieu of thrice sacred verity, most absolute zeale and perfect deuotion. The Spanish Monarchie arriueth in Parnassus, She intreateth Apollo to be cured of a Cau∣terie: Shee is dismissed by the politike Physi∣tians. Rag. 4. 3 Part. IT is now foure months since the renowmed Maiestie of Spain ariued at this Court, vnto whom Apollo forthwith assigned a day for her puklike & solemn entrance, which by the consent of the whole Consistory of the learned, was appointed to be in the royal Audience Chamber, in the presence, and with the assistance of the Soueraigne Muses: which solemnity (for some vrgent occasions) was not per∣formed but two daies since. The reason is, because she hath spent the full time of foure moneths in consultation with the Poet Princes, about the Titles which shee should mutually giue and receiue from o∣thers; as also in agreeing about the manner how to receiue them, and how they would receiue her in their reciprocall visitations. The consideration whereof hath made all the vertuous of this Colledge, to stand amazed, and bitterly to bewaile the hard condition of these moderne times, infected with the contagion of so many complemental vanities. And the grie∣uances of the vertuous were so much the more increased, for so much as diuers learned Princes openly refused to bee visited by that great Queene, saying, that they feared to re∣ceiue some insult or affront from her, for they had lately re∣ceiued letters from Italy, wherein they were by their lo∣uing friends forewarned to be circumspect, and vigilantly stand vpon their guard, it being peculiar vnto the Spaniards to goe visit others, with intention rather to iniu y than to honour them. And that they thought it an egregious folly, in lieu of auoiding of affronts abroad, to expect them with bended knees and cap in hand at home in their owne houses. And although that so potent a Monarchie (to the great admiration of all) hath shewed her selfe much more nigardly, in giuing others satisfaction of Titles, than in distributing of her Duckats, shee hath notwithstanding receiued from these Poet Princes, and from all vertuous Potentates (who concerning this titular circumstance, stand rather vpon re∣all substance than on the vanity of things) the greatest gust and contentment she could desire. True it is, that one thing hath much empaired the reputation of so great a Queene in this Court, which is, that albeit shee stand in extreme need of trusty friends, shee neuerthelesse sheweth herselfe so pro∣cliue and foreward to alienate those from her, who expect for nothing at her hands but satisfaction in words. Yea, some haue noted (as a remarkable thing) that the Master of the Ceremonies hath forewarned her Maiestie, that those precise punctilio shee so nicely stands vpon, are most odious, and onely proper to barbarous Kings, and right worthy her royall Maiestie. And that a great Queen in Europe, her equall, hath in great passion and anger plain∣ly told him to his teeth, that she much maruelled both at him and all his ceremonials, since hee seemed not to know, how a Prince without grauity and State, may rightly be compa∣red to a peacocke without a traine. It is impossible to set downe with what longing curiosity and earnest desire, so re∣nowmed a Princesse hath bin expected by all the learned of this Court: for, from the vtmost bounds of all Apollo 's Do∣minions, an infinite number of all sorts and sexes, haue flocked hither to view the countenance of that mightie Queene, who with a prodigious stream of happines, hath in short time vnited & brought vnder her diuers potent King∣doms, and with them framed an Empire so formidable, that there is no Prince in the known vniuerse, but for feare & sus∣pition of her, hath at some time or other bin driuen to put on a lacket of maile, or a Cuirace of steele. This Queene not many moneths since, attended on by a numberlesse Fleet, with prosperous nauigation, arriued safely in the Isle of Lesbos: and the most honourable Ladie the Republike of Genoa, hath gratis lent her her most fa∣mous Port, although by reason of a certaine ancient prero∣gatiue, the family of the Dorias draw a very great reuenue out of it. The Spanish Monarchie, in comparison of that of France, of England, and of other ancient Monarchies of Europe, is but yong in yeares, but in body and bulke far bigger than any other whatsoeuer: and to the proportion of her yeares, she is of an vnmeasurable greatnesse, whereby it is argued, that if she continue to grow vnto that age in which humane bodies are wont to receiue increase and growth, shee will prooue an huge Giantesse, and attaine to that boundlesse height of vniuersall Monarchies, vnto which the Romane Monarchie came. But he accidents of matters, and secrets of State, affirme most assuredly, that she cannot grow much greater. And that in her tendrest yeares shee is sprung vp vnto that height of bodie, vnto which shee may in any long time attaine: which is euidently perceiued by this infallible argument, that in these daies, shee groweth but halfe an inch with grea∣ter difficultie than in former times she did two handfull. This potent Lady is of so swarthy an hue, that shee drawes neere vnto the Moore or Affrican. And therefore are her comporiments rather disdainfull and proud, than serious and graue and in all her actions she sheweth her selfe more cruell than seuere. And for as much as she could yet neuer learne the Art so necessary vnto Prin∣ces, to pardon, it is the vndoubted opinion of many, that it will proue some hindrance to her greatnesse: for glorying in nothing more, than to be called the Doctoresse of all Na∣tions, in the Science to be implacably-resolute, in knowing how to cut off the tops of those haughtie and luxurian Pop∣pies, which in the gardens of her States doe proudly ouer∣top others, she greatly reioyceth that it be said, how in this Art, she hath excelled that great Tarquinius, that was the first inuentor of so mysterious a secret. She being then so hardie and resolute in committing of seuerities, she is much perplexed in conferring of fauours, which are seldome seene to proceed from her. And those few that she bestoweth come from her with such an impe∣rious haughtinesse, that they are not very acceptable. And yet in exterior semblance shee is all affabilitie, and wholly spends herselfe in complements. But he that with the spe∣ctacles of State-policie can prie into the inmost of her heart, shall easily perceiue, that shee is all Pride, all Auarice, all Crueltie. So that all they that haue any long time treated or negotiated with her, report, that none receiue from any other Princes more milde-honied words, and more bitter deeds. Whence it is, that as a friend she doth greatly allure men, and as a mistris much insult vpon, and terrifie them. Her hands are beyond all due proportion long, which shee extendeth farre and neere, as occasions serue, without distinguishing of friends from foes, or stranger from kins∣man. Her nailes are like an Harpies, and most griping. Her fingers are of so hard and fast-hold, that what once comes into her clutches, shee neuer lets goe againe. Her eyes are blacke, and a most sharpe piercing sight. Her looke is squint, with which wishly beholding one, she fixedly looketh vpon another. A thing of great danger vnto Princes; for of late daies, hauing bent her face towards Algiers, no man suspecting it, she had earnestly fixed her looke towards Marseilles. In her eyes is plainly discouered a most greedy and in∣satiate desire, since that there is nothing that shee fixeth them vpon, but shee most greedily wisheth and coueteth the same with all her heart, and that's the reason, that our obseruing Speculants say, that this Queene doth immode∣rately thirst after others goods, and that as yet she neuer had friend, but with her tricks, and wilie-beguilies, she hath in the end made her slaue. All which things discouer plainly vnto the world, that she is rather fit to gouerne slaues than free men. For there is no other Princesse whatsoeuer, that more ambitiously la∣boureth to ingrosse and forestall all seruice into her hands, not onely from her owne subiects, but from her best friends. She obserues so punctuall a forme of State, that she doth not so much as vouchsafe to goe meet good occasions, which infinite times haue sought her in her owne house. She farre excelleth all other Queenes, both present and past in knowing, how vnder her rich robe of cloth of gold to paliate her priuate interesse, be it neuer so diabolicall. And although she be daily seene to commit most dam∣nable actions, she makes no greater ostentation of any thing than of her conscience; whereby the French, who vnder colour of her holy and religious pretexts, haue so often beene ouer-reached, haue at last (to their no small cost) learn'd to arme themselues, and to get on horsebacke, when with a Crowne in her hand, they see her propose, or treat affaires full of religious pretexts, and sacred charitie, towards her best beloued neighbours. She is so cunning in the exercise of riding, that she hath not onely successefully tamed and broken the generous Coursers of Naples, but also the rough and skittish Mules of Spaine, which by a naturall instinct are wont to kick, to whinze, and bite at all men. She is of all other Queenes of so mistrustfull a Genius, that, except her owne Nation, she hath declared all others (though subiect vnto her) to be of no confidence, albeit she haue diuers times, and in all occasions found them right trustie and faithfull; which point is so preiudiciall vnto her, that the most skilfull in the worlds affaires, doe proba∣bly conclude, that by reason of this one most important defect, it is impossible she should grow bigger. The reason is, because there is no other Queene, that careth lesse to be beloued of her people, than she, and that endeuoureth more to be feared. And therefore doe our Polititians note this in her as a kinde of notorious follie, that shee confidently beleeueth, that with misusing and hurring all men, shee shall induce them to adore her, and with such hatefull deportments, al∣lure all Nations to serue her: For the great store of her trea∣sures, is the forcible Adamant, which violently attracts vn∣to it the mindes of some, who vtterly abhorring her, are bound to seeke, and by all meanes procure her declination. She is most curious and accurate in matters of small mo∣ment, whereas in weighty and important affaires, no other Queene hath more easily suffered herselfe to be supplanted and ouer-reached. In her discourses, and in resoluing of most important bu∣sinesses, she sheweth admirable wisdome, and circumspecti∣on; but whether it be through her naturall tarditie, or arti∣fice of her officers, who are all most greedy merchants of great negotiations; or because she is of opinion, that no resolution is done with decorum, that is not long a doing, and with tedious delayes expected of all men. Shee executeth her determined resolutions with such slownesse, that the face of affaires changing with the times, her resolutions determined with great wisdome, doe often proue vnhappy. And therefore doe all conclude, that shee is more coura∣gious in the skill of plotting machinations, than in the ex∣ercise how to manage Armes, in which she sheweth to haue an vndanted heart, a resolute constancie, and an vnspeaka∣ble sufferance of all crosses and inconueniences; but so weake in resolutions, that her extraordinarie circumspecti∣on hath many times the semblance of timiditie. Whence it followeth, that shee seemeth more apt to maintaine States, than to acquire them. Diuers notable men laugh at her, to see her addresse and gouerne all her actions by the compasse of certaine solid and mature Counsels, without euer refer∣ring them into the hands of that Fate or Chance, which hath so greatly fauoured the French, and yeelded them so glorious, when in their actions and managements, they haue gouerned themselues with much valour and little braine. There be some that thinke this hapneth, onely because she is as sparing of her owne bloud, as she is thirstie and in∣satiate of other mens. And therefore doe the expertest Cap∣taines of warre mocke and gibe at her, to see her aspire at the Empirie of the whole Vniuerse without euer fighting. The reason whereof is, because this most potent Queene, being of long time accustomed to purchase great Estates by Alliances and Mariages, she abhorreth the dreadfull cu∣stome of the French, to conquer kingdoms with the price and hazard of their owne dearest bloud. She being then more wittily-warie than boldly couragi∣ous, it followeth, that she is more mischieuous vnto her ene∣mies in times of peace, than warre: whence it is, that the French, who hitherto haue liued with her in a supine or stu∣pid carelesnesse, after so many calamities endured, haue at last learnt to double the barres of their doores, when they haue concluded peace with the Spaniards. She is most carelesse and lauish of her owne riches, but so greedy of other mens, that shee careth not to desolate her Patrimoniall Estates, so shee may make conquest of others. She is of so secret and hidden thoughts, and of a minde so abstruse and vnsearchable, that there is no wit, artifice, or skill of man able to looke into her drifts. Nay, Linx him∣selfe with his through-piercing sight, cannot penetrate in∣to them, no not so much as the outside of them: whereas men of a glimmering or short sight, may plainly see into the very bowels of the French and other Nations. For he that shall with with iudgement goe about to de∣scribe the Genius and customes of so great a Princesse, must confidently beleeue, that in all the managements she hath in hand, and in all the affaires that others negotiate with her, shee is inwardly cleane contrary to that shee appeareth without. And although that among the foresaid vertues, shee be full fraught with so enormous vices, notwithstanding by reason of her prodigious fortune, all of them are interpreted and admired in her as vertues, whence it followeth, that di∣uers great Princes take it as an honour to imitate her in her vices. She is of a most sturdie and robust complexion, whereby all iudge her to be long-liued. She onely languisheth of the indisposition, to haue her limbs much distracted, which doth much debilitate the for∣ces of so huge a bulke. And although that with the helpe of the libertie of Ge∣noa, and of the alliance shee hath with the Duke of Sauoy, shee vseth diuers meanes and artifices to contract them; ne∣uerthelesse by reason of the diuersitie of the interesses of these Potentates, she makes no great vse of them. This mighty Princesse receiueth no greater damage from any, than from her chiefe Spanish Officers, whom alone she imployeth in great charges, all which are by them exercised with such, and intolerable surquedrie, as they will not onely be honoured as men, but adored as Gods. An impertinencie so great, as it hath stirred vp a loathing, and nastinesse of the Spanish Dominion, not onely in the Italians, and in the Flemmings, but in the Spaniards them∣selues. One thing hath caused great wonderment in all that be∣hold so potent a Queene, which is, that her whole bodie is full of horse leeches (for the most part of Genoa ) some of which are so big and fat, as they appeare to be of those great Ecles that come out of Holland, or those big Lampreis that breed in Seuerne It is not knowne whether it be through impotencie, or negligence, or through a destinie fatall vnto great Princes, whose vitall bloud these noysome creatures seeke euermore to sucke, that shee endeuours not to shake them off, and be freed from them. This most mighty Queene then, being entred into the Royall Palace before Apollos Imperiall Maiestie, stretched forth her left arme, causing her seruants to vnswathe the same, and so naked, shewing it vnto Apollo, and to the whole sacred Colledge of the learned, she thus bespake. Imperiall Sir, and gratious father of all good letters: This which your Maiestie seeth; yea euen this is that stink∣ing cauterie, and loathsome issue of Flanders, which the French, the Germanes, and some Italian Princes, that now friendly faune vpon me, together with the helpe of that for∣midable Virago, and transmarine Renegada made in this mine arme, for the distrust or suspition they had of me. I acknowledge that the Princes forenamed had iust cause to be iealous of my power, when after the death of Henry the second, they saw France falne into the wretched calamitie of Infant-Kings, and that I, in their minoritie, sought to sowe discords in that goodly kingdome. Now that these suspitions are vanished, and that (ay me, why doe I not blush to speake it?) the contention, which I haue had with the French, and particularly with that vn∣danted limbe of the Deuill, the Prince of Bearne, is now ended, and that I haue at last beene condemned my selfe in all costs and charges: My humble request vnto your Ma∣iestie is, that this grieuous and fasheux cau erie be healed, and closed vp. For most men are of opinion, that for the infinite number of humors, that haue runne vnto it, it is now become so festred and enraged a cankre, as I feare (which God a ert) it will proue the losse of my arme. I did not passe into Italie through mine owne ambition, or vnquenchable thirst, wholly to sway the same, as mine enemies report. It is well knowne to all the world, that I was vntimely called thereunto, and euen haled vnto it by the Princes of Italie themselues, to free them from the great feare they were in of the French. And there is no man liuing in Europe, but knowes how that in the States that I possesse in Italie, I imploy so large a share of my stock and free-hold, as they rather serue to further my weaknesse, and keepe me still oppressed. And thrice-happy were my Spanish home, which I might ere now haue couered with tiles of pure sil∣uer, and states of massie gold, had I neuer had intelligence, or dealings with the Italian nation, so double-hearted, so full of fallacies, so anxious of priuate interesses, and onely good to embarke her neighbours into dangerous affaires without bisket; and then vpon the least occasion, shake them off, and leaue them in the lurch, or in the midst of their greatest danger; as shee, that openly professeth the tricke and skill to plucke creuises out of their holes with others hands, and not with her owne. And I haue often wondred, how Italie, which (as all the world knowes) hath suffred herselfe to be broken, sadled, and backt, and ridden by all strange Nations, will now stand vpon such nice punctillios of chastitie with me, who if she but see me stirre (be it neuer so little) shee presently entreth into suspition, that I goe about to rauish her of her honour and liberty. And howbeit, the greatnesse wherein the kingdome of France doth now finde it selfe, may assure Italie, and all the forenamed Princes from the feare they haue conceiued of my power; I am neuerthelesse (if it bee your Maiesties pleasure) ready to giue all men good caution and surety De non offendendo: on condition, that this to me so loathsome and irksome issue be healed and closed vp. By the expresse appointment of his Maiestie, the cauterie was with all diligence viewed and considered by the Poli∣tike Physitians, who after long and mature consultation of the whole Colledge of them, they vnanimously concluded, that it most euidently appearing, that the Spanish Monarchy is continually troubled with an vncessant thirst, to sway and dominere, she stands in need of that running issue, by which those grosse and peccant humors, which from Peru distill into her stomacke, may be purged and euacuated; for they are the cause of her vnquenchable and hydropicall thirst. Those excellent Physitians did likewise consider, that if the said Monarchie had not that Cauterie, there were most euident danger, that the pernicious humors of Peru, might ascend into the head of Italie, to the manifest ruine of those principall members, which yet are left sound in her; and that the said Monarchie of Spaine might easily fall into an incurable Dropsie of an vniuersall Monarchie; against which dangerous inconueniences they affirmed, there is good prouision made with the Cauterie of the Low Coun∣tries, which ought to be kept open, so long as Peru (so stir∣ring a member) doth subminister those pernicious humors vnto the Spanish Monarchie. This resolution did mightily displease her, wherefore in great passion and perturbation of minde, thus she brake forth: Sir, if through the spight and malignitie of others, I must so fouly languish and consume my selfe in continuall prouiding and applying vnguent for this corroding cankre, which mine enemies call a Diuertiue Font ell, some, who haply thinke least of it, shall lay clouts and plaisters vnto it. Her quip was presently vnderstood by the English, by the French, and by the Italians, who replied, that they nor fea∣red, nor doubted of any thing; since they sent nothing in∣to the Low Countries, but the garbage, the offals, the filths and sweepings of their States; whereas the Spaniards did there waste pure gold and consume vitall bloud. And there∣fore, both the English, the French, and the Germanes, to arme and secure themselues from the formidable power, boundlesse ambition, and secret machinations of the Spa∣niards, who haue no Horizon, were forced, in conformitie of the Aphorisme or the Politike Hippocrates, Tacitus, Consilijs, & estures externas moliri arma procul habere. The Spanish Monarchie goeth to the Oracle of Delphos, to know whether shee shall euer ob∣taine the Monarchie of the world; she hath a crosse answer. Rag. 10. 1 Part. YEster day morning, two houres before day, the re∣nowmed Monarchie of Spaine, in great secrecie de∣parted from Parnassus, in a Caroch with six horses, hauing taken but a few followers & confederates of her Court to art end her. Her departure hath ministred no small iealousie in all this Dominion, but more especially in the Monarchie of France, who was much moued thereat. And to finde out what way she had taken, presently tooke post, and following her tracts, ouertooke her euen as she ar∣riued in Delphos before the Oracle of Apollo; vnto whom the Spanish Monarchie presenting herselfe (as they report that were present) she proposed this question. Oh eternall and bright lampe of the world, the right eye of heauen, who art the bringer not onely of the day, but of all goodnesse vnto mankinde. Thou knowest that long since, all my thoughts haue bin addressed vnto that vniuersall Monarchie, vnto which none euer attained but the Romane people. Thou knowest the ef∣fusion of blood, and the prosusion of treasures that I haue caused and spent, to reach vnto the goale of my intention. Thou only knowest the teilsome vigils, the bloody sweats, the industrious practises that I haue spent, suffered, and plotted, to come vnto so important a designe. Thou likewise knowest, that by the indefatigable dexteri∣ty of my wit, by the mighty vertue of my coyne, and by the marchlesse valour of my Nation, I did not many years since sow so infinite seditions, and raised so turbalent warres in the very heart of France, on which I had laid the foundation of all my hopes, I had well nigh obtained the wished end of mine intention: And how for a finall conquest of all lets and rubs I wanted but the meanes to vnite Naples vnto Mi∣lane: which difficultie if I can once surmount, I may boldly vaunt to haue wonne the game. But since either by my fa∣tall misfortune, or by the impossibility of the businesse, or by the power of so many cruell enemies that are risen vp a∣gainst me, the scandals of the reuolutions, which with so many machinations, for the space of so long time, I had dispersed among the French, whom I could yet neuer van∣quish, are in one onely day conuerted into that peace and tranquility, that my heart is aggrieued to see, and my minde abhorreth to remember; as loath to make an vtter hauocke of so many of my people I entended to employ in this en∣terprise, I haue almost brought them vnto a finall desolation. And because I would no longer bee a laughing stocke vnto the world, I here prostrate my selfe before thy sacred Maie∣stie, most submissiuely beseeching thee to giue me a direct answer, whether that vniuersall Monarchy which I haue so deeply riuetted in my heart, and which is the onely ayme of all my actions, is by the will of heauens destinated vnto me; which I desire to know, to the end if there bee no impossi∣bility in the pursuit thereof, I may rouze vp my spirits, and by the possibility of it, keepe my Spaniards in heart. For, to tell thee the very truth, who pryest into the secretest thoughts of all men both by Sea and Land; by the infinitenesse of conspiracies, of counter-mines, and of complots, that by mine implacable enemies haue bin plotted and contriued a∣gainst me, and now more than euer are practised to my de∣triment, I begin to faint and dispaire of any good successe. At this exorbitant question the Temple did shake, and the earth trembled round about a great distance off, when from the mouthof the Minister of Apollo proceeded these words. The vniuersall Monarchie shall againe returne to the farre renowmed Italian Nation, at what time it shall haue ba∣nished those intestine iarres, and ciuill discords which haue brought her in bondage to forraigne and strange nations. After so dolefull an answer, the Spanish Monarchie, full of spight and anguish came forth of the Temple, but con∣founded with amazement when shee saw the Monarchy of France present her selfe before her, whom (hauing first en∣tertained with some ordinary complements) shee tooke by the hand, drew her apart, and friendly imparted vnto her the answer that the Oracle had giuen her. And how the vniuersall Monarchie was by diuine pro∣uidence like to return vnto the Italian nation; which thing succeeding, France should finde and feele new Iulius Caesars, as Spaine second Scipioes. And that to secure and settle their affaires, shee thought there was no better way than to share and diuide Italy equal∣ly betweene them. Moreouer she offered to teach her the secret that she most successefully had experimented in the Indies, by vertue of which, they might both assure themselues of the Italian Na∣tion, in such sort as there should no memorie be left in the world of so wicked a race of men but the bare name. Vnto whom the French Monarchie framed this answer; Oh Spaine, first suffer me to forget that most vnfortunate diuision of the Kingdome of Naples, which my King Lewis the twelfth made with thee, and then we will confer of this matter. For, know Spaine, it is not so easie a thing to consen and iniurie the French the second time, as I see you per∣swade your selfe. Then as touching the secret you propose vnto mee, how wee may assure our selues of the Italians, I pray you doe you attempt it and put the same in execution, since to desart and desolate the world of people (as you haue done and practised in the Indies) and to dominere ouer a bare land void of in∣habitants, is a certaine politicke precept that is not found in the Register of the French reason of State. For, I haue (and that to mine owne cost) learnt to bee contented with a little so it be good. And therefore doe I found my greatnesse more on the multitude of good subiects, than on the wide extent of a Kingdome. And so that my French Nation may liue at ease and com∣modiously in this world, I am well pleased to admit of other Nations therein. The negotiation of the concord of Italy is long and tedi∣ous; and you know by good experience, that purges giuen to assure a man from a disease he feareth, do many times ha∣sten the same. I will not omit with the Genuine liberty, that is proper to my nature, confidently to tell you, how that the enterprize to subdue all Italy, is not so easie a taske as I perceiue you apprehend to your selfe. For, when I had such toyes in my head, which to me proued most pernicious, and I verily be∣leeue will proue no better to you, I thought as you thinke now: and I haue manifestly discouered, that the Italians are a kinde of creatures that are euer more warily vigilant how to escape our hands, and who can neuer bee tamed, or brought vnder the yoake of strangers bondage. And al∣though as most subtle Apes, and crafty Monkies, they easi∣ly transforme themselues into the customes and fashions of those Nations that sway them, yet doe they euer keepe fixed in their hearts their ancient malice and hatred. They are great Merchants of their seruitude, which they trafficke and trucke so cunningly, that if they but once put on a paire of Breeches after the cut of Madrill, they will in∣duce you to beleeue that they are become true and perfect Spaniards; and if they weare but a great Folio ruffe of Cam∣bricke, we presently thinke them to bee turned into right French-men. But come once to the close or vpshot of any businesse with them, they will then shew you more teeth than can be found in fifty bundles of handsawes, or a thousand combes. And Italy doth iustly resemble those greedy and couetous Dames, who with the strong and sharpe lye of their blan∣dishments scald their vnheedy louers, but neuer let them come to the iouissance and fruition of that which they most desire. And therefore beleeue me (who haue to my no small cost made tryall of it) concerning the conquest of Italy, you shall in the end reape nothing but losse and shame. Philip the second of that name, King of Spaine, after long strife about his Title, makes his so∣lemne entrie into Parnassus. Rag. 12. 3 Part. THE most Mighty King of Spaine, Philip the se∣cond, who (two moneths since) arriued in this Court, could not before yesterday bee admitted to make his publike and solemne entrance. The rea∣son hath bin, because that in certaine triumphant Pageants which the Spanish Nation hath with royall magnificence erected vnto him, there were fairely written, these words; Philippo secundo Hispaniarum; vtriusque Siciliae, & India∣rum Regi Catholico, Italiae pacis Auctorifoelicissimo. Which words, for so much as they were somewhat di∣stastfull vnto most of the Italian Princes, they instantly re∣quired that they might be cancelled and blotted out, saying, that (vpon no tearms) they would neuer acknowledge that peace of Italy from the Spaniards, which themselues so dear∣ly, and with such vast summes of ready money purchased of the Hollanders and Zelanders. This Aromaticall contestation was long debated and can∣uast to and fro. And although the Italian Princes did con∣cludingly prooue in iudgment, that the present peace of Italy did not directly proceed from any well-meaning since∣rity of the Spaniards, who if they might haue had their wils, would haue enthralled the same, had not that great diuersi∣on bin made to them, but ought wholly to be acknowledged from the warres in the Low-Countries. Now in the greatest heat of this controuersie, the Queene of Italy, with her wonted wisdome, interposing her selfe, appeased the same, who hauing conuoked all her Princes, she exhorted them to leaue all vaine ostentations and spungy vauntings vnto the Spaniards, and meditating on reall and substantiall subiects, continue to feed them with vapou∣rous smoke. The Horse-troope, both for the quality and number of the Princes that concurred to fauour, to court, to attend, and to serue so great a King, was the most numerous and the most honourable that euer was seene in Parnassus. So was this mighty King ranked among those Monarchs, which in the world haue bin more famous for their wisdome and saga∣city, than for their courage or valour in warre. Moreouer, the Impresa which hee caried in his royall Standard made all the learned of this Court to wonder, which was a faire painted Writing-pen, by vertue of which it did euidently appeare by the testimony of some Historians, that both in the most potent Kingdome of France and elsewhere, where any fit occasion had beene offered vnto him to make vse of it, hee had caused and stirred vp more and greater ruines, spoiles, rapines, wracks, and hauocks, than euer his Father Charles the fift could cause or effect with the greatest part of the Cannons of Europe. The Impresa was highly commended by the sacred Col∣ledge of the vertuous: All Writers taking it for a great ho∣nour vnto themselues; that a Pen in the hand of one that had knowne how to vse it, had archieued and effected so memo∣rable and remarkable actions. This great King hath still bin most royally entertained in Parnassus; for, euen the chiefe and most eminent Mo∣narkes in Europe haue held it as an honourable reputation, to be able to attend and serue him. So that euen the next day after his ingresse into this Domi∣nion, being disposed to be trimmed, & to commit himselfe into the hands of a Barber, the great Queene of England disdained not all the while to hold the Bason vnder his Chinne. And the most renowmed martiall King of France, Henry the fourth, surnamed the Great, tooke it for a matchlesse glo∣ry to himselfe to be admitted to wash his head, which hee performed with so exquisite skill and artificiall dexterity, as he seemed to bee borne in that exercise, and brought vp Prentise in that trade. Although some enuious detractors haue giuen out, that he did it without any Sope or Washing-ball, but with strong scalding Lye alone. This mighty Monarke hath bin presented by all the ver∣tuous of Parnassus, with diuers gifts of Poetrie, and other quaint and much elabourated Poems, all which hee hath counterchanged with great liberality, and bounty. And to a certaine learned man who presented him with an excellent discourse, wherein was demonstrated the way and meanes, how, and in what manner most noble Parte∣nope, and all the most flourishing Kingdome of Naples, which by the vnsufferable outrages of the Soldiers, by the robberies of the Iudges, by the tyrannous extortions of the Barons, and by the general rapins and ransakings, which the griping and greedy Vice-royes that from Spain are sent thi∣ther, onely to cram and fatten themselues, is now brought vnto extreme misery and desolation, might be restored vn∣to the ancient greatnesse of its splendor, he gaue a reward of twenty Duckats of gold, and consigned the said discourse vnto his Confessour, commanding him to keepe it safe, for that it was written very honestly and religiously; whereas vnto a most cunning and sufficient Politician, who deliue∣red him a very long Treatise, but altogether contrary to the first, as that which treateth of politicke precepts, and shew∣eth what course is to bee held to depresse and afflict the said kingdome of Naples, lower and more than now it is. And how it may with facility bee reduced vnto such misery and calamity, as that generous Courcer w ch the Seggio of State, without any headstall or saddle, hath hitherto (with no hap∣py successe) borne for an Impresse or recognisance, may bee compelled patiently to beare a Pack-saddle or Panier, to ca∣ry any heauy packe or burden; yea, and to draw in a Cart. For so much as hee was informed that it was iudiciously compiled, and according to the right tearmes of moderne Policy, hee assigned a gift of twelue thousand Crownes rent a yeare, and moreouer made him a Grand of Spaine. The Dogs of the Indies are become Wolues. Rag. 22. 3. Part. ON the night of the twelfth of this present, about eight of the clocke, arriued in post-haste a Cur∣tier dispatched from Lisbone vnto Apollo, who told his Maiestie, that he had brought him most important newes from the West-Indies. The next morning very early, all the learned ran to the Court, to heare some newes. And the Spaniards were the first, who with great anxietie inquired, whether there had lately beene discoue∣red some other mount of Petofis, or a new Rio del Plata in the Indies, which if it were, they would speedily haste thi∣ther, to plant the holy word of God. The French were very importunate to know, whether some new world had beene found our, which with making the Spaniards more powerfull, might helpe them vtterly to subuert the old-one. Apollo had no sooner read the letters, but he fell into a ance of sorrow; and hauing inuolued himselfe into a oggie mist, a shower of abundant brackish teares was seene to trickle downe his cheeks; which was taken for a most disastrous presage: by which sudden alteration, all men iudged, that the Post had brought very bad newes. Now whilest all the Court was full of all sorts of learned and vertuous men, who in great anxietie longed to vnder∣stand the cause of his Maiesties publike sadnesse; after sun∣dry clattrings of thunder, and infinite flashings of lightnings, which they heard and saw, there was heard an horrible and dreadfull voice, which said: Oh you, that inhabit the Earth; fast, macerate, and cloath your selues with haire-cloth; sprinkle your selues with ashes; eat your bread with teares; endeuour with humble prayers to asswage the wrath of God; and with contrite hearts, and penitent soules, suppliantly beseech him, that of his infinite mercy, he will vouchsafe, to deliuer all humane-kinde, inhabiting the old world, from those portentous and monstrous nouelties, which wee certainely vnderstand to haue lately hapned in the new. At so vnexpected, and pro∣digious aduertisements, infinite of the Vertuous, by the wounding affliction that they felt in their hearts, fell downe in a swoune, thinking verily that the West Indies had beene vtterly consumed by fire, or ouerwhelmed by the furie of mercilesse waters. In this terror and dismall plight, all the people in Par∣ assus, with showers of teares, with throbbing sobs, with groning howlings, with loud-shrill voices, as the like were neuer heard, cride for Mercy, Mercy: and with most sub∣missiue intreatings and groanes besought Apollo, that hee would daigne to impart vnto his deuout subiects, what those mischiefes were, from which they should intreat the immor∣tall God to be deliuered. Then from the aforesaid Court of his Maiestie was heard a second voice, which gaue all men to vnderstand, that the dogs which the Spaniards had transported into the Indies for the safegard of their flocks of sheepe, were all become such rauenous wolues, that in worrying and deuouring of flecced cattle, they exceeded the voracitie and cruelty of the greedy Tigres. After so drearie and vnhappy tidings, all the learned in Parnassus burst forth into wailfull cries, and lamentable skreeks, dolefully complaining, that if the dogs, which were placed for the guard & safetie of the sheepe, became wolues, so rauenous, as they deuoured whole flocks; vnto what Gardians night Shepherds hereafter recommend the keep∣ing and safe custodie of their sheepe? And their flocks being now destitute of the protection of dogs, who haue alwaies beene so faithfull vnto their Masters and Shepherds, how could it be possible, but that the whole Genus and kinde of sheepe must needs decay and perish through all the world, and become the most vnhap∣pie creatures of all others, since they must be a prey both to the Wolues their enemies, and to the Dogs their friends? Whilest all the Nations of Parnassus (surprised by so great terror) were all dismaid, fainting, swouning, and groueling on the ground, onely the Flemmings and the people of the Low Countries, were seene all dreadlesse and vndismaid, to runne leaping vp and downe Parnassus, in∣couraging all men to pull vp a good heart, to be of good cheere, and neuer droope or faint: for there was no calami∣tie nor miserie could or be threatned or inflicted on man∣kinde, which by an vndaunted resolution, and resolute minde, might not be or diuerted or auoided. And with lond acclamation they gaue all men to vnder∣stand, that euen in their owne Countries, those dogs and currs, which the Spanish shepherds had sent for the guard of the Flemmish and Belgick flocks, were transformed into such rauenous wolues, as with their fierce immanitie, and fell brutishnesse, they deuoured all their sheepe; and that ere this they would haue woorried the whole race and flocks of the Low Countries, if by the resentment of that bold and couragious determination (now famous through all the world) they had not prouided a sound remedie for it. And therefore, if those mischiefs should befall the old world, which (as the report was) were hapned to the new, they wished all men to know, that the true and only remedie, to chastise those Currs, tainted with that foule fault, to woorrie, to rapine and deuoure harmlesse sheepe, was, to giue them some Holland-Nux-vomica, and (as they deserued) make them to vomit out their very heart, and burst and burst. The French are humble sutors vnto Apollo, to know the secret, how to perfume gloues after the Spanish fashion. Rag. 9. 3 Part. THE emulation that raigneth betweene the two most warlike, martiall, and mighty nations, the French, and the Spanish, is as great as eternall. For there appeareth no vertue in the French, that is not most ambitiously sought after by the Spaniard. And the French is neuer quiet vntill he haue attained vnto all the ra∣rities wherewith he seeth Spaine endowed. Now forsomuch as the skill or sleight of the perfuming and tempring of Amber, with which they make their gloues so sweetly odoriferous, is the peculiar inuention and meere endowment of the Spaniards; The French haue omitted no manner of pursuit, to finde out, and attaine the perfection, how to make the like. For they haue with anxious labour, and to their cost prouided themselues of Muske, of Amber∣greese, of Ziuet, and of all the most aromaticall drugs, that the Orient affordeth; but all proued vaine and effectlesse. For neither their cost, nor all their diligence haue beene sufficient, to make them obtaine the end of their wished in∣tention: yet rather than they would giue ouer their pur∣suit as desperate, the thrice noble French nation had recourse vnto Apollos Maiestie, as the onely producer of all Aroma∣tikes and sweet gums, whom shee hath most instantly be∣sought to vouchsafe to reach her the true way, how to per∣fume gloues with Amber-greese, wherein the Spaniard is so cunning. It is most certaine, that Apollo was neuer seene to laugh so heartily, no not when he saw the downefall of vnhappy De∣dalus, as he did at the impertinent request of those French sutors, whose hands he commanded his Priests, that were about him, to smell vnto. And that they should make a true report what they smelt of, the Priests presently obeyed; and told his Maiestie, that they had no ill sauour, but smelt very sweet. Which Apollo hearing, he told the French, that Nature did euermore counterchange others defects with some rare vertue or other. And therefore had he conferred the gift, to make sweet-smelling gloues only vnto that Nation, whose hands were so ranke, that they did euer stinke worse than any carrion. Why the Monarchy of Spaine is lately retired into her Palace. Rag. 14. 3 Part. FOrsomuch as many daies were past since the Monar∣chie of Spaine had shewed her selfe in publike, and hath not onely euer since, liued as a recluse in her owne house, but hath continually kept all the doores thereof fast shut. The Italian Princes, and aboue all the Venetians, not only most diligent searchers into mens thoughts, but carefull and studious obseruers of that great Queenes actions, seeing so strange an alteration, entred into anxious and great iea∣lousies. And because it hath neuer beene possible for them or any other to know, what her so sudden retirednesse might signifie, all men did argue, that it could not be without some secret mysterie. The Venetians for iealousie of their owne Estates, impati∣ent of delayes, by ladders set vp against the walls of her pa∣lace, entred in at the windowes thereof, and saw that she was very busie with one of her chiefe officers, called the Mar∣quis Spinola, labouring hard with diuers rare and artificiall engines, to stop all the holes, gaps, chinks, and creuisses in and about her house. And wondring not a little, to what end she should doe it; they presently aduertised their friends speedily to arme and prepare themselues; for so soone as the Spaniards should haue stopped all the gaps and holes of any supply, helpe, or succour, they would assuredly giue chase to all the mice and rats, and make an vniuersall slaughter of them. How the ministers and officers of Spaine are continually interessed in their priuate profit. Rag. 20. 3 Part. THree daies are now past, when about nine of the clock at night, there were seene to enter forty cart loads of hay into the Royall Palace of the Monar∣chie of Spaine. And forsomuch as the strange and vnseasonable houre, made the French, the Venetians, and other Potentates, who liue in continuall iealousie of the greatnesse of so formidable a Princesse, to suspect some mis∣chiefe, there was speedy search and diligent inquirie made, to know the mysterie of so strange prouision; and whether vnder that hay, the carts might be laden with any vnlawfull and forbidden goods. Whereupon many Spies were set a worke about it, who found out, and reported, that vnder the hay there were hid∣den and stowed certaine chests full of mattocks, spades, pick-axes, and shouels. And because these are instruments and tooles belonging to Pioners, Sappers, Diggers, and la∣bouring-men, the French presently resolued to arme them∣selues. And the Venetians were about to lanch their Gal∣lies from out their Arsenall into the Sea; when by some Polititians it was aduised, before they should discouer their intention, to finde out, whether the Spaniards had at any time before made prouision of such tooles or implements, & whether they expected to receiue any more else-whence. But they were vndoubtedly assured, that before that time they had neuer receiued any, nor did hereafter looke for any more. The said did besides certifie vnto them, that so soone as the said chests were vnladen, they were not caried into the royall Armorie or common Magazin, but that all the Grandes of Spaine, and the chiefe Officers of so potent a Monarchie, did presently diuide those spades, mattocks, scoopes, shouels, pick-axes among themselues; with which the very next day very early they began to dig ditches, to draw rills, to conuey riuelets, to direct gullets, to reare banks, to frame scluses, and to fill the country with aque∣ducts, and water-pipes, with such labour, paine, and dili∣gence (euery man drawing all the water he could procure to his owne mill) as they had brought all publike matters, and the whole State to such miserie, and calamitie, that the mills of the communitie of Spaine, for want of water, could nor goe, nor worke, nor grinde. Apollo hauing vsed all possible meanes, and ex∣quisite diligence, to haue some one of the Court-Mignons, or Princes-Idols taken and appre∣hended, doth seuerely proceed against one late∣ly fallen into the hands of the Iudges. Rag. 5. 2 Part. APollo (to his infinite griefe) being come to a perfect knowledge of the most enormous disorder, which the shamefull blindnesse of those Princes causeth, no lesse in great Empires, than in pettie Principalities, who com∣mit that vnpardonable excesse, to subiect and enuassal them∣selues vnto a base and new vp-start seruant of theirs, since neither his Maiesties continuall exhortations, nor the frightfull calamities, which for the said foule excesses an in∣finite number of Princes hath suffred and smarted for, hath beene of force to remoue them from that hard destinie, by which they seeme violently to be drawne, to precipitate into the bottomlesse whirlpoole of so outragious inconuenien∣ces; forsomuch as he would not abandon the protection (a quality proper to his Maiestie) of the gouernours of man∣kinde. Some few moneths are now past, since he resolued with all rigour to persecute those seruants, that with their prodi∣gious ambition, and artificiall tricks (altogether diabolicall) vndertake to rule and gouerne their Lord and Master. And therefore did his Maiestie not many yeares since publish most grieuous mulcts, and rich rewards, to be inflicted vpon the offenders, and giuen to those that should reueale any such vnto his Iudges. Two weekes are now past since one of these varlets, ha∣uing bin accused vnto the Magistrate, was presently appre∣hended and laid vp, who by many euidences being found foule and guilty, was laid vpon the racke, where he confes∣sed all the horrible tricks, shifts, wiles, circumuentions, masks, and detestable iuglings, that he had vsed and practi∣sed, not onely to induce his Master to become his slaue, but euen to adore and worship him. Apollo hauing read and considered the processe and en∣ditement against that monstrous villaine, fell into a strange amazement, how those Princes (who are so greedy of do∣mination that they often fall into moody iealousies, and vn∣naturall suspitions, not onely of strangers, but of their own children) may or can (either through their owne gullish∣nesse, or monstrous fraud of others) fall into that reproach∣full infamie, to become vassals, and euen slaues vnto a base rascally seruant of theirs. And hee thought it a most portentous case, that there should bee found both Sonnes and Nephews vnto Princes, who to obtaine the goale, to dominere ouer their fathers, and to Lord it ouer their Vncles, had shewed spirits full of ambi∣tion, and minds extremely thirsty, to sway and command, and by cunning policies, and politike mysteries, had attai∣ned the garland of their desires, the very same men short∣ly after, could themselues fall or decline into that abhomi∣nable metamorphosis, to forgoe their domination purchased with so great care, anguish, wiles, and sweat, and make one their superiour, that is so farre their inferiour. A wonder so rare and extrauagant, as humane wit can no more giue a reason for, than of the hidden vertue of the Ada∣mant stone. Apollo, to the end that by the exemplary punishment of that darling-Courtier, Princes might learne some so profita∣ble document, as might in some sort terrifie them from com∣mitting so hateful indignities; three daies since he summōed all the Princes now resident in this Court, to appeare before him in the great Audience-Chamber. In presence of whom, their greater confusion, with a loud and intelligible voice, caused the abominable enditement, framed against that villanous varlet, to be read by Bossius, his Maiesties Clarke of the Crowne, who being demanded what tricks, course, or art he had vsed to reach vnto the end, so absolutely to ouer∣sway & gouern his Lord and Master, answered, that the very first day he came to the Court, he wholly applyed his minde and wits, exactly, and with all diligence punctually to obserue the Genius of the Prince, which hauing ound to be naturally inclined vnto lust and luxury, he with gentle, plausible, and cunning artificiall manners, did presently o apply himselfe to commend a vice so vnworthy a man that hath the charge and gouernment of a State committed vnto him (as if laciui∣ousnesse had bin an egregious and laudable vertue.) And how he vsed all possible industrie to become his in∣stru ent or minister in them: which hauing easily obtained, he imployed all possible industrie to prouide him with most obscene instruments to fulfill his filthy lust: and that afterwards, vnder diuers pretexts and sundry colours, he had industriously laboured, that all those vertuous, honest, and honourable seruants about the Prince, whom he knew or suspected might reclaime him vnto a debonaire and vertu∣ous life, should be remoued or discharged from the Court as vicious and professed enemies to the Prince and State; yea, some he had put to open shame and disgrace, and others he had blinded with false and surmised offices, places, titles, and honours. And had in their places aduanced and substituted some of his owne creatures, dependants and confidents, who were all deeply plunged into all manner of carnall sensuality and bruitish lasciuiousnesse, by whose meanes and furtherance (he affirmed) to haue employed all his study and care that his Lord and Master should be vtterly depriued, and shake off some commendable and genuine endowment, which by na∣ture, and from his former education hee had attained vnto▪ and had after that so wrought, that vnder colour of being false and disloyall, all the old Officers of the State, were or discharged or expelled the Court, whose iust condoleances and grieuances he had pourtraid and represented vnto him as sedi ious railings and petulant detractions: and had so preuailed with him that their important charges and offices were all conferred vpon men without iudgement, without wisdome, without honesty, or without charity towards their Princes welfare, or priuate interesse; hauing in recompence required nothing at their hands but confidence, secrecie, and a strict adherence to his owne affaires; by whose meanes hee had so beset, besotted, and circumgired his Lord and Master, that it was neuer possible afterward for truth (which as the shadow to the body should perpetually and inseparably bee vnited vnto a Prince) to come to his notice or eares, by the relation of any well meaning or faithfull friend to him or, the State. And that afterwards to the end he alone might absolutely rule, and vncontrouledly sway the State, hee had so fairely allured him to sloth and idlenesse, that hee brought him to be plunged euen vp to the eyes in pleasures of Gardens, in recreations of countrey houses, and in sports of hunting and hauking: nay, he had so far preuailed with him, that he abhorred as things most hatefull to heare of State-matters, or of his proper interesses. And had besides induced him to beleeue that his treache∣rous plots and practises to make him fall out with his owne Sonne, and other Princes of his blood, was an vnfaigned zeale of inward loue and hearty affection towards him: a spotlesse charity towards the publike benefit of his people: and that by his quaint artifices and iugling trickes, hee had brought him to be so stolide, so stupid, & so gullish, that the manifest and insolent tyranny of his base seruant (knowne & abhorred by the simplest of his state) was by the vnfortu∣nate Prince, named to be a vigilant regard to his seruice, an easing of him from paines, a disburthening of him from cares, and a charity towards the Common-weale; and that sloth, idlenesse, lithernesse, and carelesse negligence was an honourable rest and quiet repose. And moreouer, to the end his Prince might neuer awa∣ken or rouze himselfe from out his drowzie and shamefull laethe-sleepe, and by opening his eyes, come to the know∣ledge of his owne stolidity, idiotisme, and gullishnesse, and so discouer others trecherous ambition, hee had filled his Court with Flatterers, Parasites, and Sicophants, who with plausible blandishments, and infamous perswasions, extol∣led and commended his silly vnaptnesse to bee a matchlesse valour: the generall hatred of his people, to be a louing and vnfaigned affection: all publike railings and detractions to be exaggerated praises; confusion and disorder to be a perfect gouernment, the tyranny of a lewd villain to be honourable and carefull seruice, extor ions to be sacred iustice, lauish prodigality to be vertuous liberality, his abiect lithernesse, and crauen timidity in hauing so basely neglected and aban∣doned the helme and gouernment of his State, he commen∣ded to be right honorable labours, diligent endeuours, and politicke gouernment. All these perfidious treacheries be∣ing confessed by that false wretch, so amazed and terrified those Princes that heard them, that with a loud voice they all cride out, that, to become most rigorously cruell against so impious and wicked a villaine, with Gallows, Gibbets, Rackes, Wheeles, Halters, Axen, Tortures, Flames, and bloody weapons, were true and charitable piety and pitty. And therefore they should all ioyntly become Suiters vnto Perillus, to deuise some new kinde of torment, as might di∣laniate and teare in peeces that monster of nature, and yet not depriue him of life; to the end there might neuer more be found a man that durst dare to commit so hainous and outragious villanies. And all the Princes were so moued with the foulenesse of that enditement, as vnanimously they all besought his Maiestie to shew some extraordinary rigors against those, who by the fraudulent wiles and exorbitant trickes of their seruants, suffer themselues to so vi uperous and shamefull a state. Now for so much as by this vertuous instance intimated by those Princes vnto Apollo, his Maiesties minde was so moued to compunction, that teares were seene to trickle downe his cheekes, some Idiots that stood by, deemed this to proceed from the excessiue contentation which Apollo felt, to heare the great horrour, whereby Princes had embra∣ced and fostered that vice, which his Maiesty so much desi∣red they should shun and detest. But the wisest and best of the Vertuous that were present at that act, knew very well, that Apollo wept and bewailed the vnhappy blindnesse of those inebriated and infatuated Princes, who abhorring their owne excesses in others, did most instantly require, that those vices into which the greatest number of them were im∣perceptibly, and at vnawares plunged ouer head and eares, might with some extraordinary and rigorous seuerity be pu∣nished. So mischieuous and pernicious is that reproachfull and detestable vice in Princes to idolatrize Mignons, which they exactly perceiuing, and extreamly blaming in others, they neuer see, but rather fauour and commend in them∣selues. And whom doe wee see fall into this foule fault, and shamefull errour, but such as make most ostentation to bee the Aristarco's and reformers of the world? The whole race or Genus of Sheepe send their publike Ambassadors to Apollo, by whom they earnestly entreat him to grant them sharp teeth and long hornes: whose suit is by his Maiesty scorned and reiected. Rag. 88. 1 Part. THE whole Race or Corporation of Sheepe haue sent foure Ambassadors to this Court, which this present morning haue bin admitted by his Maie∣stie to haue a royall audience. Whereupon a great and goodly Magistrall Ram of Lincolne-shire, in an articu∣late bleating voice vttered these words; That the Sheepe knew very well, that that God, who had created all things, had vsed so great charity and impartiall iustice towards all sorts of liuing creatures, as he had recom∣penced the defects and imperfections of some with other equiualent endowments of vse and vertue. So that in so in∣finite a multitude of bruit Animals, there was not one that might iustly complaine to haue in its creation receiued any wrong at his diuine Maiesties hands. But yet it seemed vnto them that (as a step-sire) hee had shewed great partiality onely with the Sheepe, forsomuch as hauing created them with diuers imperfections, it did not appeare that hee had endowed them with any equiualent vertue by or with which they might (if not assure their state) yet at least bee able to liue in this world with that safety and quietnesse that other creatures did. For although his diuine Maiestie had created the Hare with wondrous timidity, with sharpe teeth, and without a heart to bite, he had necerthelesse endowed her with so swift a foot as did assure her from the tushes or fangs of the fier∣cest beast. And that the Fox could not iustly find her selfe agrieued to haue beene created slow of foot, his Maiesty hauing en∣dowed her with such sagacity of wit, as shee could with faci∣lity auoid the wiles, the snares or ambushes of any wild beast. And that hee had so recompenced the slownesse of the Wolues running with so hardy an heart, with so keene a tooth, with so circumspect a genius, as being a terrour to all beasts, hee makes himselfe to bee awed and respected of men. Moreouer it euidently appeared, that his Maiesty had vsed the same charity vnto the Fowle and birds of the aire, since that vnto those to whom hee had denied the speedy vse of their feet, he had in recompence giuen them larger wings, and a swifter flight, namely to Pheasants, to Partridges, and to Quailes, who in requitall of their short wings and traine feathers had the nimblenesse of their feet. And that the sil∣ly Sheepe onely, hauing bin created with so blockish a stu∣pidity of wit, heartlesse, slow-footed, and without those keen biting teeth, with which other beasts make themselues to be awed and respected. They thought themselues forsaken and reiected by that diuine Maiesty and charity that had manifested so great dile∣ction and louingnesse, euen vnto wild, fierce, and hurtfull Beasts. The said goodly tall Ram added moreouer, that to fill vp the measure of the incomparable calamity of the harmlesse and disarmed sheepe, his Maiesty had allotted the Lions, the Tigres, the Beares, the Wolues, (being the most cruell and blood-thirsty Beasts that wander vpon earth) to bee their fa∣tall and implacable enemies. So that it seemed that the poore Sheepe were created only to feed and to be a prey to those enraged and furious beasts, that know not what satiety meaneth. Hee said moreouer, that vnto the vnsupportable iniuries which the Sheep recei∣ued daily from their enemies, were likewise added the out∣rages and misusages which their owne Shepheards continu∣ally heaped vpon them; all which proceeded because they were so disarmed & weaponles: For, if they might be so hap∣py, as but once in ten yeares, if not for reuenge, at least for correction, vpon certaine occasions, to haue teeth allowed them to bite certaine cruell and indiscreet Shepheards, who milke them without charity, and sheare them without discre∣tion, peraduenture they should bee more kindly and better dealt withall. And their Shearers, or rather Shauers, would more gently handle their Sheares, and not hurt or teare their skinne. And therefore the whole kinde or race of Sheepe, that they may no longer bee the load-stone or subiect of most wailefull oppressions, doe most instantly beseech his sacred Maiesty, to haue long teeth and sharpe hornes granted them to bite & gore their enemies, that so they may become more respected and better esteemed. To this rammish request Apollo answered with a blith and chearefull countenance, that the Sheepe had made a request suitable and worthy their silly simplicity, since they know not how among all the foure-footed Creatures that liue vp∣on the earth, no one can be found more fauoured and priui∣ledged than they; for, whereas others are with number∣lesse cares and infinite dangers enforced to shift and sharke for food, diuers of which are constrained to imploy the night (ordained for sleep and rest) to feed and sustaine themselues, as not daring to beseene by day; only for the Sheep, euen by men (who are Lords ouer all wild beasts, and possessors of the earth) Pastures and Fields are prouided, reserued, and with carefulnesse and labour hired, purchased, and manured at excessiue and deare rates. And that in darke and stormy nights, in foule weather, and at all times, they alone were carefully prouided for, cha∣ritably fed, tenderly watched, and diligently guarded in their folds, yea, and desended from their hurtfull foes. And whereas other creatures were continually hunted, chased, and pursued by many sorts of other rauenous wilde beasts, and entrapped by the wiles and deuises of men; for whose destruction infinite people apply themselues to nothing more than to weaue nets, to frame toiles, to lay springes, to set traps, to hide ginnes, to dig pit-falls, and to breed, to teach, and to feed dogs. Onely the Sheepe by an especiall grace and prerogatiue, enioyed the noble priuiledge, to haue men labour so indu∣striously for them, and to shield them from so infinit dan∣gers; and that the Creator of this vniuerse had made demon∣stration of especiall predilection towards the whole race of Sheepe, who in lieu of rauenous teeth, goring hornes, and swift legs, had graciously granted them the powerfull and subduing weapons of rich wooll, of nourishing milke, of dainty cheese, and of diuers other sorts of vnualuable ri∣ches, with which they so forestalled and possessed the loue of men, that for the endeared charity that they beare to all Sheepe, they vncessantly hunt, chase, pursue, and destroy Wolues, Tigres, Beares, Foxes, Lions, and all other wild and rauenous beasts, which loue not Sheepe, with all man∣ner of armes, rapine, or bloody cruelty. And how by reason of the singular gifts and incompara∣ble benefits that Sheepe bring to all mankinde, being repu∣ted the onely deliciousnesse, delight, and wealth of man, it came to passe that they were the most numerous race or kind of creatures that liue vpon the earth; so that the Sheepe be∣ing nourished, fed, cherished, guarded and defended by the vigilancy, care, cost, paines, & charity of their Shepheards, they shewed themselues very simple and foolish in desiring to haue deuouring sharpe teeth, and long goring hornes. And at last Apollo said, That concerning the seuerity of some Shepheards in milking and shearing of them, they ought to vse no other weapons to reuenge themselues, than those of dutifull obedience and humility, with yeelding them store of wooll, plenty of milke, abundance of cheese; and , co study fertility and fruitfulnesse. This being the supreame of the brood and race of Sheepe, that those Shepheards who misuse and euill intreat their flocks, are in extremity cruell vnto themselues; it be∣ing most certaine, that a wound rashly giuen to a Sheepe, hath the propriety to kill the Shepheard. And therefore he straitly commanded them, to take greater heed to manifest the least inclination or shew to bite their Shepheards, than they would doe of Wolues keene teeth, since those Sheepe cannot be accounted so happy, which with all humility and prostrate obedience, do warrant and guard their Shepheards from all harme and danger, as those most vnhappy, that make a dismall profession, to terrifie and make them afraid. In a publike congresse or Assembly, contrary to the accustomed manner of the Phoebean Court, Force hauing pretended to preceed Reputati∣on; that illustrious Lady with an excellent re∣solution, maintaineth her reputation and credit which was in some danger. Rag. 15. 2 Part. THat the Lady Reputation in all publike places and as∣semblies hath yet euer had the precedence and right hand of Lady Force, is well knowne in Parnassus. But it fortuned the other morning, that whilest A∣pollo made his solemne entrance into the signe of Leo, Force (according to her terrible genius, borne vnto insolencies) dared to presume to preceed Reputation, who, if in that oc∣casion (making vse of her admirable dexterity) shee had not knowne to reto t and put by so dangerous a rub, and vnex∣pected stop, shee had vndoubtedly receiued some notable affront. She was neuerthelesse much offended at the foule petu∣lancy offered her by her capitall enemy, whereupon the ver∣tuous, euer much deuoted vnto so excelse a Princesse, ceased not to encourage her, exhorting her by no meanes to pocket vp the insolency of her temerity. And moreouer, bade her to remember, that she was the right arme of all Potentates, and the sole instrument wherwith Princes Lorded and swaied the world. And therefore willed her to pull vp a good heart, and resolue to confront that fondly rash Dame, whom with the only Maiesty of her countenance she would at the first encounter so daunt and abate her pride, that (as a thousand times it had come to passe) shee might with great facility suppresse and bring vnder. With wondrous reposednesse of minde, and gentle words, Reputation answered those vertuous men her louing friends who so comforted her, that shee exceedingly valued and lo∣ued the ready good will, which she perceiued in them all; but she could neither commend nor follow the counsell they gaue her. And that they should call to minde, that the whole of the power of her authoritie and greatnesse being foun∣ded, not on the forces of strong-armed Armies, nor on the strength and securitie of inexpugnable cittadels, but on the bare opinion of men; a thing most inconstant and varia∣ble. So as it behoued her, in this her aduersitie, to proceed with great caution, and admirable dexteritie. And that be∣tweene her, and Force, there was a monstrous great dispa∣ritie: for if Force were once vanquished, shee might easily recouer her selfe, and with greater impetuofitie attempt a se∣cond battell, so much the more dangerous for her; for to her ordinarie power shee might ioyne the violence of Dis∣daine, and the shame of her first ouerthrow. But if it should happen, that at the first shock shee did not quell her enemy, either with the maiestie of her presence, or with the authori∣tie of her looke, so that as an Elephant, which being once fallen to the gound can neuer rise againe, she might destroy her, shee should wholly be depriued of that greatnesse and awfull respect, which the publike veneration of the common people bred in her. Considerations so much the more necessarie in her, as she had experienced, that nothing is more perillous for her, than by force of Armes to seeke to maintaine that auctoritie great, and that reputation on foot, which shee seeth to bee founded but on the bare opinion of the vulgar popular. And that shee hoped to prouide for the indemnitie of her authoritie with her wonted remedies, and would with her accustomed weapons buckle with Force, not doubting but to conquer her. She said moreouer, that Force did now vse those extra∣ordinarie termes of insolencie towards her, not because her power was any whit increased, but by reason of some disor∣ders of hers, shee perceiued the ancient decorum, her won∣ted maiestie, and the peoples veneration towards her to be greatly diminished. Reputation hauing vttered these kinde words, went away, and shortly after retired her selfe into her lodging; whence for diuers moneths space shee was neuer seene to come a∣broad, but with great seueritie gaue her selfe to reforme and correct her selfe, for euer banishing all self-respects and pri∣uate interesses; to which, because shee had yeelded ouer∣much, and too openly abandoned her selfe, shee euidently perceiued her honour and credit to be much impaired. And then with the beesom of a rigid reformation in her selfe, she wholly imployd her time in cleansing her house and mi∣lie from all manner of filthinesse, pollution, and basenesse; from which she also chased and expelled griping Auarice, daring Ambition, and all other priuate, dishonest, vnlaw∣full or scandalous passions. This Princesse hauing thus reformed her priuate disor∣ders, being one morning to be present at some solemne and publike Act, she extraordinarily embellished and adorned her selfe all ouer with honestie of minde, with vprightnesse of spirit, with singlenesse of heart, with vngrudging libera∣litie, and with all her other most esteemed vertues. And ha∣uing put on the rich robe of righteousnesse, and affectionate loue towards all well-deseruing creatures, and of publike charitie, she came forth with so awfull a maiestie, and comely a grauitie, where shee was expected by all the other most excellent Vertues, in whom shee stirred vp so great respect, and regardfull veneration, that euen the Lady Force her selfe (so great was the deuotion that possessed her minde) was seene to tremble and stand amazed: and in that occa∣sion, not only with her accustomed reuerence, to grant her her due precedence on the right hand, but with a kinde of seruile submission, to beg, as a singular fauour at her hands, the prerogatiue, in that solemnitie, to carry vp her traine. The Prouince of Focides by her Ambassadors complaineth vnto Apollo, that his Maiesties officers doe not permit her to enioy her priui∣ledges: whose request is not only reiected, but they haue a most sharp and vnpleasant answer. Rag. 1. 2 Part. THe most populous Prouince of Focides, which some yeares since rebelled from the Ignorant, and voluntarily did subiect it selfe vnto Apollo's Dominion, of whom she obtained so ample priui∣ledges and large immunities, as it might truly be said, that the Focenses liued in a kinde of free libertie, hath now sent her Ambassadors to this Court, to complaine against his Maiesties officers, that they will not permit them to enioy those priuiledges, which by his sacred Maiestie were granted them. And therefore doe instantly require him, to com∣mand the due obseruation of them. This businesse, which somewhat distasted Apollo, was by him referred vnto his Royall Councell of State; from whom the Ambassadors two daies since had for a finall an∣swer, that the Lords of the Councell did greatly wonder, and rested much scandalized, that the people of Focides seemed to be so ignorant of the affaires of the world, as they knew not, that Priuiledges, Liberties, Franchises, Exempti∣ons and Immunities granted vnto people newly conquered, were like vnto those cherries, that were giuen to children when they cryde and puled, to make them hold their peace, but were afterwards taken from them when they lay still and quiet. To whom the chiefe of the Ambassadors stout∣ly replied, that if in Parnassus they vsed so fouly to abuse sillie well-meaning people, Focides would ere long fall to whining againe, to the end it might be stilled with cherries of new priuiledges. To this companion, Francis Guicciardin, Lord President of the Royall Counsell suddenly answered, that if the F ∣censes did well consider the present state wherein they were, they should finde, that with the Cittadels, which in times of peace they had suffered to be built vpon their necks, they were reduced vnto such termes of bondage and thraldome, as if they fell to whining againe, they might very well, without any danger or preiudice vnto Apollo's state, be stil∣led and made to hold their peace with smarting lashes and bloudy stripes. Socrates hauing this morning beene found dead in his bed, Apollo vseth all possible diligence, to discouer the true occasion of his sudden death. Rag. 32. 2 Part. THis present morning, great Socrates, who yesternight went to bed in perfect good health, hath beene found starke dead in his bed: and forsomuch as his corps was all swolne and puft vp, most men doe vehemently sus∣pect, that there hath beene some machination of poyson practised vpon him. And the Peripateticks (cruell enemies to the Socratike Sect) haue beene much questioned and bla∣med for it. And so much the more, because it is well knowne to all men, that the most detestable armes of poysoning are very familiar vnto Aristotle. Prince of that great Sect. All Socrates his houshold hath this morning beene im∣prisoned, from whom no other light or confession can be wrested, but that some daies before, Socrates was seene and obserued to be much anguished, grieued, and perplexed, still seeming to feele some griefe of minde; for he was diuers times heard lamentably to exclaime, Oh corrupted world! Oh depraued age! Oh most-most vnhappy mankinde! Apollo, who hath felt an extraordinary sorrow for the losse of so great a Philosopher, hath strictly commanded the body to be opened, to see whether his bowels and entrailes yeelded any signe or likelyhood of poyson, which being done, all his interiors were open, whereby it was euidently percei ed, that Socrates, by reason of the infinite filthy things, enormous abuses, and scandalous obiects, which he was compelled daily to view and behold in this depraued and corrupted Age; and for hauing taken a great windi∣nesse of scandals, hee was forced to burst. Most rich and sumptuous haue the funerals beene, that were celebrated for so great a man. And Marcus Tullius Cicero (a most affectionate fauourer of the Socratike Sect) with an excellent and elaborated O∣ration, hauing highly extolled the veritie of the doctrine, with flouds of teares bewailed the calamitie and miserable condition of these present daies; in which with rigorous seueritie, all men are strictly forbidden to satyrize. And honest Gentlemen beholding continually things most worthy to be published by sound of horne and trum∣pet, are inforced to see, to hold their peace, and to burst. Natalis Comes the Historian, for hauing spoke some thing in a publike congresse of learned men, that grieuously offended Apollo, is by his Maiestie seuerely punished. Rag. 49. 2 Part. VVHilest some few daies since, Natalis Comes a Latine Historian, together with diuers other learned men of this Court, vnder Melpomenes Porch (as the custome of Historians is) discoursed of the glory of those great Princes, that haue left any eternall me∣morie of their honourable actions in the world, termed by the name of a glorious conquest the vsurpation of a king∣dome, made by a mightie Prince, without any iustice, right, or lawfull pretence. Which speech being presently reported vnto Apollo by one of those wicked and make-bate spirits, whereof the Ai e, and the Earth is euer full: His Maiestie fell into so passionate a rage against Natalis, as at that very instant he caused him to be put in prison, and at once vsed the rigor, straitly to forbid him, for the space of three whole yeares, the ingresse into any Libraries. And howbeit Apollo haue most importunately beene sol∣licited by most of the chiefe Historians of this State, to pro∣ceed with some milder terme of mercy towards so vertuous a follower of his, he neuerthelesse hath and doth still refuse to doe it. And saith besides, that there is no greater wickednesse in the world, than the impious and trecherous licence, which diuers Princes haue vsurped vnto themselues, to rob and steale whole States and Kingdoms one from another. An action that hath filled the world with those lamenta∣ble mischiefs, and deplorable confusions and disorders, that so much afflict mankinde. And he thinks it an iniquitie extremely outragious, that in his vertuous Dominion, there should be found any one learned man so perfidious, as durst dare to stile those trecherous thefts, and vnlawfull robbe∣ries, which are committed with a million of aggrauating and impious circumstan∣ces, by the title of glori∣ous conquests. THE NEW-FOVND POLITCKE. THE SECOND PART. CHAP. 1. Maximilian the Emperour is aduertised of the trouble begun among his Sonnes. T Here came three Posts very lately vnto the Maiestie of the Emperour Maxi∣milian the second; and presently it was knowne how they brought him aduertisement, that the Arch-duke Matthias had taken Armes against the Emperour Rodolphus his brother, sedi∣tiously requiring the Kingdomes of Hungary and Bohemia, and the absolute Dominion of Au∣stria, and other Prouinces. These ill newes infinitely trou∣bled the minde of the Emperour; for he well knew, that the discord risen vp among his Sonnes, would giue the enemies of the house of Austria that content, which they so much de∣sired. Whereupon, yesterday morning very early, that Prince presented himselfe before Apollo, and with many teares demaunded of him, when the euils of the House of Austria, so long before commenced, through the cruell com∣bination of all Germany against it, should haue an end; and for what demerit such fearefull scourges were sent vnto his house. Vnto this demaund Apollo answered in this sort: All the troubles and persecutions of your Family, great Em∣perour, shall cease, when it shall wholly abandon those ambi∣tious thoughts of desiring to command ouer Hungary, and Transiluania, which hath giuen vnto Germany such iealou∣sies, that to secure her ancient liberty from the power of your house, she bendeth all her study to nothing more, then to the depression of it: for the Germans, searing greater prejudice from your acquests, then from the victories of the Turkes, are fully resolued rather to lose Vienna, then recouer Buda, And then also shall all Germany vnfainedly loue your Arch∣dukes, when deposing their present ambition, they shall make it appeare, that they desire to be equall, and not supe∣riour to other Princes of Germany. CHAP. 2. Most of the Princes, Common-weales, and States of Europe, are weighed in a payre of Scales, by Lorenzo Medici. SEeing it is apparent, that the Roman Common-weale, after the acquisition it had made of the Empire of all Italy, could in a short time arriue to that Vniuersall Monarchy, which is yet so famous to the world, and whereunto many ambitious Princes haue since in vaine a∣spired, it hath beene a generall receiued opinion, That that Potentate, who in State and Forces is suffered to grow vnto such greatnesse, that he findeth no other Prince able to coun∣terpoyze him, no more then the Roman Commonweale did, after it became Commander ouer Italy, cannot possibly bee impeached from obtayning the Vniuersall Monarchy. Whereupon those Empires and Kingdomes, which were af∣terwards framed out of the pieces of the Roman Monarchy, to auoyd those calamities and dissolutions, which fell vpon such Potentates as were oppressed by the Roman Forces, out of most wholesome, and almost diuine counsell agreed toge∣ther, that euery fifteenth yeare, all the Princes of Europe should assemble into one place; where each ones Forces should be seuerally weighed; and thereupon fit counter∣poyze, and due mortification be giuen vnto him, that was found to be growen to any greatnesse, which might be odi∣ous and dangerous to his Competitor. Many great Wits were from time to time preferred to that honourable charge of gouerning the Scales; but for an hun∣dreth yeres past or thereabout, they were managed by the Illustrious House of Medici, and in particular by Lorenzo the Great. Which prerogatiue, although to many it seemed preiudiciall vnto the Maiestie of the Popes, and prudence of the Venetian Senate, who haue alwaies watched; if not more, at least-wise equally with Lorenzo, and the Florentine Com∣mon-weale, to maintaine both in Italy and abroad, the For∣ces of the Potentates of Europe euen ballanced, yet with a maruellous consent of all the Historians the gouernment of the Scales was giuen into the hands of Signior Lorenzo. The first day of August, then all the Princes and Potentates of Europe, assembled in Phocis, not onely to meet with so im∣portant a businesse as the perfect knowledge of their owne affaires, but that also of others, which in matter of State im∣porteth much more. Whereupon by an ancient and just prerogatiue, the first that came to be weighed, was the Aristo∣craticall Monarchy of the Apostolike Sea; whose temporall State was put into the Scale; and because the weight of the last fifteenth yeere was but sixe Millions of pounds, and now was found to amount vnto seuen and an halfe, euery one knew, that the addition of the noble Duchy of Ferra∣ra had caused that increase. The next that was put into the Scale, was the State of the seuen Princes Electors of the Ro∣man Empire, which by old Records appeareth to haue weigh∣ed in times past seuenty Millions of pounds; but since, by the indiscreet gouernment and courses of many Emperours, that lusty complexion, which made it euermore redoubted, was so spoyled, that it fell into those dangerous and foule in∣firmities, which after a long Quartane, found end in an He∣cticke Feuer, that hath now so consumed it, as our age behol∣deth it left with nothing but very skinne and bone. How∣beit, though it be so much decreased in State, yet the great bulke it hath of body, maketh it in shew very goodly to look vpon; the rather, because the intrinsecall imperfections are not discouered: for many good persons with the ancient Titles of the Empire, and Maiesticall name of Caesar, haue beautified it very excellently without, but when it came to be weighed, it was found quite empty within; a feather not being so light, as the name of a Prince without authority is vaine: whence it is that the Roman Empire proued so weake, as it weighed but 480 pounds. Then the famous Peeres of France brought vnto the Scale the flourishing and warlike French Monarchy; a square of fiue hundreth and fifty miles euery way, replenished with an infinite Noblesse, armed on horsebacke, which not onely maintaineth peace at home, but maketh so great a King formidable to all the Nations of the earth; besides a world of learned men which adorne it; Mer∣chandise and Trades which enrich it; Tillage and Husban∣dry, which make it plentifull, and abounding with euery good thing. The ancient weight of so famous a Monarchy was twenty Millions of pounds; but in the last fifteenth yeeres weight, by reason of the horrible calamities, wherein∣to (by the disloyalty of some of her Barons) she was thrown, it did not arriue to twelue Millions; howbeit, now it not onely equalled, but went farre beyond the weight of the best ancient times; for it came to fiue and twenty Millions; a matter of such maruel to euery one, that the Spaniards got on their Spectacles, and very narrowly obserued, whether the Weights were right or no. To the ancient Kingdome of France, was added the ac∣quisition of Bresse giuen vp by the Duke of Sauoy, which in regard it was so aduantagious to the City of Lyons, augmen∣ted the weight of it aboue a Million. Next were the many Kingdomes of Spaine put into the Scale by the Spanish Grandes, and to the great wonder of those ancient men, that could remember, how an hundreth and twenty yeares since, they were held in a poore and vile account, the weight a∣mounted to twenty Millions. The Spaniards remained ex∣ceeding well satisfied with this weight of their Spaine: and assured themselues, that with the addition of so many other States, they had besides to put into the Scale, not onely to equall, but farre to exceed the fiue and twenty Millions of the French Monarchy. Wherefore instantly they put into the Scale the flourishing Kingdome of Naples, which euery one thinking would increase the weight at least 2 Millions more, it appeareth, that then it weighed lesse by one and an halfe: at this strange accident the Spaniards being much amazed, said, That either Lorenzo had vsed some fraud in the weigh∣ing, or that of necessity the Scales were not euen; because it was a monstrous thing, that the addition of matter should abate of the weight. Whereunto Lorenzo coldly answered; That his Scales were euen, but that neither the Indiaes void of Inhabitants, nor the Neopolitans, & Milanese, which were so farre distant from the Forces of Spaine, and replenished with a people, which so vnwillingly supported the command of strangers, weighed any thing at all: for it was the loue and multitude of subiects, the fertility and vnion of States, that giue weight, and turne the Scale. Hereupon the Spaniards added the Dutchy of Milan in∣to the scale, which in like manner abated a million of the weight; whereat also the Spaniards were so much astonied, that they would not put Flanders into the Scale, fearing to receiue a greater distaste and affront. Howbeit some said, that if they had put in the Indiaes, they might haue wrought some good effect, but not those miracles which certaine la∣uish tongues haue deliuered; who with the same facility talke of milions of Crownes that the Furnace men make of very bricke and tyle. Then came the English Lords, who put into the Scale their Kingdome, so much redoubted for the strength of the wonderfull situation thereof; for the continued mountaines which compasse it about, seruing for walls, made by the very powerfull hand of God in forme of bulwarks, and the Ocean for most profound Dit hes, make it a Kingdome feared, in regard of the commodity it hath to assaile others; and the insuperable difficulties which they shall finde that offer to attempt it. The weight of this Kingdome was answerable to that of the last fifteenth yeare which amounted to sixteene Millions. But the English, to giue more weight to their Kingdome, would haue put the Kingdom of Scotland into the Scale when the Scottish Nobi∣lity with drawne swords in their hands opposed themselues; freely protesting, that they would neuer suffer their countrey to be annexed to the kingdom of the English; for yet fresh was the lamentable example of the miseries of Flanders, who when she saw her Earls become Kings of Spain, foolishly be∣leeued that she should command ouer the Spaniards; whereas soone after, not Spain was sacked by the Flemmings, but Flan∣ders by the couetous and cruell Spaniards; and that which made vp their misery, Charles the fifth, the Emperour, and King Philip his Son, by their continuall residence in Spaine, of Flemmings became Spaniards. The vnfortunate Flemmings by loosing their Prince, of naturall subiects, grew to bee esteemed strangers, and men of little faith. And so Flanders, the naturall Countrey of Charles the fifth, the Patrimony of King Philip, became (according to the termes of modern policy) a State of fiue States, and began to bee gouerned by Strangers; with those iealousies, and with those oppressions of customes, taxes, contributions, and donatiues, as begat those bad humours, those ill satisfactions, from whence since hath proceeded that ciuill warre, which after an vnspeakable profusion of gold, an infinite effusion of blood, an incredi∣ble losse of honour to the Flemmings, was conuerted into a couetous merchandise of the Spaniards. Therefore the Scots by such lamentable miseries haue learned, not to per∣mit their King, vpon any termes whatsoeuer, to abandon the royall Seat of his ancient kingdome, for to place it in a greater, newly fallen vnto him: in which case the Scots should vnder their cruell enemies the English, be sure to suffer all the calamities, which inferiour Nations are wont to en∣dure at the hands of the superiour. Some that were present at this Act, report, how the Spa∣niards told the King of England, that those Scots which had spoken so arrogantly in the presence of his Maiesty, were to be seuerely chastised; to whom the King of England answe∣red, That the Spaniards ought not to giue that counsell vnto others, which had proued so pernitious to themselues: and thereupon hauing commanded the stay of weighing their Kingdome, he assured his Scots, that ere long he would giue them all possible satisfaction. After this, the vast Ottoman Empire was put into the Scale; which the last fifteenth yeare arriued to the summe of two and thirty Millions, but now was found to bee lesse than sixteene; the strangnesse whereof made all the Prin∣ces very much to maruell; and particularly the Venetians, who could not beleeue such a fall; whereupon they desired, that wich more diligence it might be reweighed, and it ap∣peared, how in that little time running betweene the first and this second weighing, it had fallen eight hundred twen∣ty and two pounds: whereby it was manifest, that the Ot∣toman Empire, heretofore so terrible to the world, now con∣sumed with luxury, couetousnesse, and idlenesse, runneth headlong to his ruine, which gaue great contentment to all those Princes. Neuerthelesse it was obserued by some of the wisest there present, that the Spaniards were not so glad of it as the rest; out of a doubt they had, that the depressi∣on of the Turke, would bee the exaltation of the Venetian State. Then came the Polach Senators, and put into the Scale their Kingdome, which in regard of the small autho∣rity the King hath there, & the too much command, which the Palatines arrogate vnto themselues, made but a poore reckoning, for it did not amount to six millions of pounds, whereas in times past it alwaies exceeded twelue. After them the Signory of the Councell of Te put into the Scale the flourishing Estate of the Venetian Common-wealth, most admirable for the greatnesse thereof, and opportunity of situ∣ation fitting for all great enterprises, which went beyond all expectation in the weight, for it came to eight Millions; the cause whereof was said to bee the huge masse of Gold, which those wise Senators in so long a time of peace had ga∣thered together into their Treasury. Next came the Swit∣zers, the Grisons, and other free people of Germany, and brought their Common-weals to the Scale. Howbeit the Princes required, that they might be weighed each one seue∣rally by it selfe, wherewith the Germanes were well conten∣ted, so that it might be done. But Lorenzo hauing put the Common-wealth of Basil into the Scale, it appeared, that the greater part of the other Common-weales of Germany were all so linked together, that it was impossible to separate them one from another, which put a many of ambitious Princes there in a sweat. Then the Duke of Sauoy caused his State to be put into the Scale by his noble Knights of the Annonciata, which equalled the weight of the last fifteenth yeere; but Lorenzo hauing added into the Scale that most noble prerogatiue of Title, which the said Duke Charles Emanuell enioyeth of the prime Souldier of Italy, it was seene to aggrauate the weight a Million foure hundreth and twenty pounds. After this, with a pompe and Maiesty matchable to Kings, appeared the Duke of Lorraine; whose State, though little, equalled the weight of great Kingdoms; and it was considered that it fell out to bee so by a certaine good fortune which that Prince had, to haue his States so happily seated, that hee could easily put the Low-Countries into grieuous difficulties, by impeaching the passage of those succours which the Spaniards conduct thither out of Italy, whereby he hath growne into such reputation, that to the most offerer he selleth for ready gold the merchandise of that his adhering: in such sort, that after he had dreyned the Spaniards, asmuch as any the de outest French Lord of the holy League whatsoeuer, siding afterwards with the French, hee knew so well how to change his coppy, that a King of France, such as was Henry the fourth, the great Duke of Toscan, and the Duke of Mantoua were glad of his alliance. And fully to make vp the Spaniards iealousie, the famous Venetian Common-wealth drew into her pay a Prince of that House with such affection, that if that great Lady had not made a vow of perpetuall chastity, and her nature (according to the custome of some Indians ) had not beene stitched vp the first day she was born by the Venetian Signory, most iealous of her honour, it was verily beleeued by many, that she would haue taken him to husband. It was obserued, that the Duke of Sauoy enuied much the felicity of this Prince, because hee finding himselfe also seated be∣tweene the French and the Spaniards of Milan, as the Duke of Loraine was betweene the French and the Spaniards of Flanders, in stead of so many benefits, and so many com∣modities as fell vpon the Duke of Loraine, hee had receiued most cruell kicks, not onely from the French, then his ene∣mies, but from the Spaniards his friends, so that it was eui∣dent, the Duke of Sauoy did now plainly see, how that pra∣ctise of his with the Spaniard was most pernicious for him. Then came the Otto di Balia, and put into the scale the flou∣rishing State of the great Dukes of Tos an, which by reason of the excellent wits of the Inhabitants, perpetuall plenty, continuall peace, and quiet security it enioyeth, answered in weight to many Kingdomes. Lorenzo greatly reioyced, when he saw how vpon the foundations of those Churches and Hospitals, which he and his Predecessors in the time of the Florentine liberty had laid in their Countrey, their Suc∣cessors, according to the modell left them by Cosimo the Great, had afterwards found meanes to erect strong Cytta∣dels; whereupon Lorenzo, to make a glorious shew of the worth and wisdome of the Princes of his house, added into the Scale the admirable vnderstanding of Ferdinand the Great, with the excessiue weight whereof it was so ouer char∣ged, that the huge chayne whereby it hung brake in two, so that all went to ground. This accident of the Scales so bro∣ken, was an hindrance that other Italian Princes which re∣mained could not be weighed; whereupon it was conclu∣ded, that comming according to the ancient custome, to lay all the Princes and Potentates of Italy in ballance against the Monarchy of Spaine, out of the vniuersall weight of the Italian Princes, each ones particular would easily appeare. Into the midst of the great Hall then was brought an huge and euen paire of Balance, whereinto on the one part was put all the Kingdomes of the Monarchy of Spaine, and into the other all the Principalities of Italy, and it was seene that they stood in equall ballance; a matter of great trouble to all the Italian Princes: but whilest they continued in this ago∣ny, it was noted how the mighty French Monarchy, with one onely louing looke which shee gaue to that Ballance, wherein the Italian Principalities lay, made it suddenly to turne on that side. It may not be omitted, how the Spaniards seeing the Dukes of Sauoy, who the last fifteenth yeare refu∣sed to be weighed with the Italian Forces, now to be put in∣to the Ballance, for to counterpoise theirs, threatned them by biting their thumbs at them; whereof those Princes be∣ing aware, with a generosity worthy their vndaunted spirits, they say thus vnto them; Signory of Spain, yee can no longer feed men with hopes, for now we are throughly possessed of your courses: ye thought to haue brought the Dukes of Sa∣uoy, by the cunning of your hopes, to such a ma ne, as to for∣goe that little bread, w ch they had in the mouth of their state; to reach at the shadow of those great inheritances of Spaine, which they saw in the bottome in the water. And because the Spaniards complained for that the Dukes of Parma, Mo∣dena, Vrbin, the Lords of Mirandola, and the famous Ro∣man Barons, Gartani, Colonesi, and Orsini, which haue the Fleece, and are in their pay, were weighed with the Italian Forces; whereas in regard of that Order, and the Pensions they receiue, they were obliged to adhere to their designes, and to be the ministers of their greatnesse. They were an∣swered by those Lords, that they receiued the honours of the Fleece, and inioyed the profits of those Pensions, as ho∣nourable Ladies accept of gifts from their Louers; only in a pure way of curtesie, and not with an intent any way to for∣get what appertaineth to their honour. CHAP. 4. Almansor, sometime King of the Moores, en∣countring with the Kingdome of Naples, they relate one to another the miseries they sustaine by the oppression of the Spaniards. THe famous King of Moores, Almansor, he that many yeares together raigned in Spaine ouer the noble Realme of Granada, met yesterday with the Kingdome of Naples, and falling in talke with him, after hee had for a good space obserued the chaine, which the said Kingdome of Naples wore fastned about his legge, he told him, that the manufacture thereof being Mo∣resco, he verily thought that he had many times seene, and handled it somewhere else; and a little while after with a shew of great maruell he affirmed, that he knew it well; and how it was the very same, wherewithall both he, and the Moorish Kings his Predecessors had for the space of seuen hundreth yeares held many Kings of Spaine in seruitude; and therefore he earnestly intreated him, to let him vnder∣stand, how, by whom, and when he was chained in that manner. A very good eye, and an excellent memory hast thou, Almansor, (answered then the Kingdome of Naples ) for this vnluckie chaine, which thou seest about my legge, was brought out of Spaine by Gonsaluo Corduba, called the great Captaine, and therefore it is very likely to be the same thou speakest of. And now it is an hundreth yeares, since first I found my selfe in the miserable seruitude, wherein thou beholdest me, and from which I know not whether euer I shall be freed; for in regard of the mighty power, whereunto I see the forces of the Spaniards arriued, hauing vtterly lost all hope of assistance, that may be expected from men, I know that my ancient liberty standeth wholly in the powerfull hand of God, who had need to renue in me the miracles of the Red Sea, if my deliuerance shall follow. The yeares (replied Almansor ) confront well; for a little before the time of thy seruitude, the Spaniards vndid this my chaine from about the leg of the Kingdome of Granada, wherewithall afterwards they bound thee. But let it not displease thee, O Kingdome of Naples, to declare vnto me, how it could come to passe, that the Spaniards should make themselues Masters of such a Kingdome as thou art, so po∣tent, and so far distant from their Forces. By fraud Al∣mansor, (said the Neapolitan Kingdome) did the Spaniards get into Italy, for by open force they had neuer beene able to make such notable acquests; and as thou saidst well, so disproportionable to their Forces, which were so far off. But heare, and wonder at the large and grosse conscience of a King of Spaine in matters of State, although he vsed much Art to seeme vnto foolish men a very Saint; for thou shalt come vnto the knowledge of a Tragedy, according to the rules of my Christian Religion, most wicked and cruell; but according to the termes of moderne Policie, the most aduised that euer any Nation represented vpon the stage of the world. Alfonso my King, to his vtter, and my chie∣fest ruine, gaue Isabella his Neece (for from this vnhappy mariage did my displantation take beginning) to Iohn Ga∣leazzo, Duke of Milan for wife. The minoritie first, and then the vnspeakable silly weaknesse of so infortunate a Prince incouraged Lodouico Sforza to vsurpe the State vpon his Nephew; Alfonso, as it behoued him, sought to hinder that Tyrannie; whereof Lodouico being aware, and know∣ing, that without the ruine of my Kings, it was not possible for him to arriue vnto the end of his most iniust desire, hee fell into that resolution, which afterwards both to himselfe, to me, and to all the Princes of Italy, proued so fatall, of drawing the French into Italy, to the conquest of me. My Kings to defend themselues from such mighty enemies, cal∣led to their aide that holy soule of Ferdinand King of Ara∣gon their Cousin, who shewed himselfe so kinde a kinsman, and such a faithfull friend, that in stead of chasing away the French enemies, he diuided me with them; and to shew himselfe compleat, a little after this vnhappy diuision, hee entred into warres against the French, and hauing ouercome them, he forced them to returne full of shame, and losse in∣to their country; whereupon the good King Ferdinand without any scruple at all of conscience became my absolute Lord; and then it was, that he fastned this chaine about my legge, which thou remembrest to be the manufacture, and worke of thy Nation. And I doe not thinke, that in all the Chronicles of the Saracen , Moores, or Turks, which it is likely thou hast read, there was euer a more wicked tre∣chery recorded, done by a King, that desired to be reputed a man of a good conscience, and of an holy disposition; and that a little before had receiued of the Apostolike Sea that glorious title of the most Catholike King. Truly (replied Aim nsor ) in the Chronicles, which thou hast named of my Nation, many foule actions committed by diuers Princes out of ambition to raigne, may be read, but this which thou hast recounted of Ferdinand goeth beyond them all. But if thou, O Almansor, (said the Kingdome of Naples ) did∣dest with thy Nation keepe the Kingdome of Granada, chai∣ned so many hundreth yeares, what course tooke the Spa∣niards for to free him? That Vnion of the Kingdomes of Castile and Aragon (replied Almansor ) which followed vpon the mariage betweene Ferdinand and Isabella, occasio∣ned the liberty of the Kingdome of Granada: a most vn∣happy Vnion, the which, no lesse than I haue done, and continually still doe, the greatest Potentates of Europe haue lamented, doe lament, and perpetually with vnfained teares will lament; as that which is the true and onely root, from whence are sprung all those greatest subuersions of States, which vnto this day haue beene seene in many parts of Eu∣rope, but more remarkably in Italy. And beleeue me, Nea∣politan Kingdome, that euen till now might I haue raigned happily in Spaine, if this pestiferous Vnion had not ouer∣throwne my greatnesse; for the many iealousies that raigned betweene the Castilians and Aragonians, were my inexpug∣nable Cittadels, which would haue maintained my raigne here for euer. Withall assure thy selfe, O Kingdome of Naples, that the aids which the Popes gaue to Ferdinand, and Queene Isabella, greatly accelerated my taking in. Peace, peace, Almansor (said then the Neapolitan Kingdom) for after thou wert chased out of Spaine by the ambitious Spanish Nation, the Popes vnderwent such miseries, that it may be truly said, how with ready money they bought those extreme calamities, wherewithall afterwards they encoun∣tred; for though the Sea Apostolicall were well contented to see the Moores driuen out of Spaine, yet that satisfaction was much distasted with my seruitude, which followed pre∣sently vpon it, the Popes hauing neuer had any thing in greater feare, than that I should fall into the hands of a mighty Prince, who might make them liue in those perpe∣tuall iealousies, wherein finding themselues drowned euen vp to the very eyes, many of them, and particularly those, that haue a greater knowledge of things of the world, doe not alwaies make quiet sleeps. A cleare testimonie of the truth which I speake, was the lamentable and wicked sacke of Rome, perpetrated by the Spaniards a little after my ser∣uitude; with which ingratitude they paid the Apostolike Sea for all they were debtors vnto it, as well for the remissi∣on of the Tribute of Naples, as for the other succors, which they receiued in the warre of Granada. A calamitie, that ha∣uing past the termes of most grieuous miseries, hath in such manner opened the eyes euen of men of the drowsiest vn∣derstanding, that euery one commeth clearly to know, what it is to vnchaine the Lion out of a zeale of pietie; for the Spaniards no sooner saw themselues freed from the impedi∣ment of the Moores of Granada, but that through the am∣bition, which they shewed in desiring to command ouer the whole Vniuerse, not onely in Italie, but throughout all Eu∣rope, most important iealousies of State, and most grieuous interests of Religion discouered themselues, insomuch, that I haue often heard it discoursed by men of most vnderstan∣ding in affaires of the world, how peraduenture it would haue beene lesse preiudiciall for many Princes of Europe, that thou hadst raigned still in Granada, than that the Spa∣niards should haue passed into Italy, to acquire such im∣portant States, as at this day they possesse there. Hereunto may be added the preiudices both publike and priuate, which my ruine hath brought, and continually doth bring vnto the Italian Princes, and more particularly to the Popes, because the Kings of Spaine had no sooner fastened this chaine about my leg, but presently they began to aspire vnto the dominion of all Italy; and the quicklier to arriue thereunto, they knew very excellently how to inte∣resse themselues in the differences, which at that time de∣pended betweene the Princes of Italy and the French, about the possession of the Dutchy of Milan, wherein that top of man, Charles the fifth caried himselfe in such sort, that hee made himselfe to bee knowne the worthy Nephew of his Grandfather by the Mothers side: for hauing with the for∣ces of the Italian Princes, chased the French out of Italy, in stead of restoring the Sforzi to the State, as it was agreed betwixt him, and the confederate Princes, with the fraud of a thousand Turkish quarrels pickt of purpose, which he well knew how to inuent against the Sforzi, he made himselfe absolute Master of that so important a Dutchie. Stay, King∣dome of Naples; and making a point here, (said Alman∣sor ) satisfie me in this: Seeing the noble State of Milan was fallen into the hands of the Spaniards; what hindred them from running precipitously to the acquisition of all Italie? and seeing thy seruitude doth manifest vnto the world, that the aids and succours of Princes, serue more for the benefit of him that giueth them, than for the pro∣fit of him that receiueth them, why would not the Ita∣lian Princes rather suffer, that Milan should bee vnder the Dominion of the French, than by receiuing aide from the Spaniards, runne the danger of letting that Dutchy (be∣ing so important a member of Italy ) fall into the hands, as thou saidst it did, of the Kings of Spaine? The power of the Kings of France (answered the Neapolitan Kingdome) de∣fendeth that remnant of Liberty which remaineth in Italy, from the ambition of Spaine: for those glorious Kings out of the interest of their greatnesse will not endure, that the Dominion of all Italy should fall into the power of the am∣bitious Spanish Nation, which cannot extinguish the ardent thirst they haue of commanding, neither with the Conquest of all the new World discouered by them, nor with so great a part which they possesse in the old. Besides, the Italian Princes, who know the great perill (wherein they finde they are) of a dangerous and miserable seruitude, haue so vnited themselues together, that although they be many in number, yet make they but one Body; and the Spaniards; who haue vsed, and doe vse all possible deuices to disunite them, euidently perceiue, that they wash a Black-Moore. But touching the State of Milan, thou must know, how it was iudged more secure for the publike Liberty of Italie, that that Dutchie should fall into the power of the Spani∣ards, than that it should remaine in the hands of the French; who for that they were ioyning to Italie, when therein they should possesse any little part, there would haue beene mani∣fest danger, that they would haue made themselues absolute Lords of the whole: but in the Spaniards it would fall out cleane contrary; for their Forces, albeit very great, are not∣withstanding so far off, that by so long a tract of Sea, they could with much difficultie transport out of Spaine into Ita∣lie Forces, that were able to maintaine the acquests they had made, not that they could be sufficient to subdue the whole. Thou speakest the truth, (said then Almansor ) but goe on, and declare vnto me the prejudices, which thy falling into the hands of the Spaniards brought vnto the Popes. Know then, (replyed the Kingdome of Naples ) that whereas before, the Popes were the terror of my Kings, now it happeneth to be cleane otherwise; for they liue in a very great agony, lest the Vnion of Milan with Naples should one day follow; to which marke, they obserue, the Spaniards haue directed the scope of all their thought; whereupon the Spaniards, whose proper nature it is to make good vse of the feare, whereinto they see they haue put the Princes their neighbours, haue ar∣rogated vnto thēselues such authority in the Court of Rome, that they vaunt they are the true arbitrators of all the most important matters which there are handled. Moreouer, when the Kings of Naples were not Kings of Spaine, the Popes with euery little menace of denying the inuestiture, obtai∣ned of my Kings, Principalities, Duchies, Earledomes, and other great States in gift, buying their friendships also with marriages, and many other sorts of liberalitie; but now the feare being ceased, if the Popes will make their kinred great with titles of important States, they must be glad to buy them with their ready money, and the aduised Kings of Spaine, besides the precious Gold of intreaties, which at any hand they will bee sure shall precede for a first payment, sell them vnto them throughly sawced. Impor∣tant interests, and grieuous disorders are these (said Alman∣sor ) which thou hast recounted vnto me; but how commeth it that thou, Kingdome of Naples, which art the Magazine of Silkes, the Granary of Italy, shouldest goe so ragged, and be so leane? Seeing the Spaniards, that come naked out of Spaine [answered the Kingdome of Naples ] after they haue been three or foure dayes in my house, will needs couer them∣selues all ouer with gold, it is no maruell if I be spoyled, to clothe so many Raggedemuffins: besides, if thou sawest the rapacitie of the Vice-royes, that to recouer themselues are sent vnto me, or if thou knewest the rapines of Secretaries, of thousand Officers, and other Courtiers, which they bring along with them, all thirsty of my bloud, thou wouldest greatly maruell, how it were possible, I should sa iate the ra∣ging and greedy swallow of so many hunger-starued wret∣ches. As for the little flesh thou seest on my backe, the Spa∣niards affirme, that in the booke of a certaine Florentine, who hath giuen rules of the cruell moderne Policie, they find written, that being a Kindome conquered, after the manner of those horses which are kept onely for races, I ought to bee maintained low in the flesh. I but (said Almonsor then) the Milanesi how are they intreated? They also (replyed the Kingdomes of Naples ) are bathed with the water, wherwithall thou seest me so wet; on∣ly this difference is betwixt vs, that in Milan are drops, in my house, floods. The true occasion of the diuersitie of these intreatings is the quality of the Lombards dispositions, most vnlike to my Neapolitans: for the Nobilitie of the State of Milan are naturally phantasticall, free, resolute, and farre from that Vice so proper to my Neapolitans, of flattery, and affectation; but so bold and hardy, that they dare say, how f one onely Cremonese spirit had beene found amongst my Neapolitan Barons, it would haue hindred that same forced donatiue, that hath brought me to eat bread and onyons; the which, although with great words, it hath bin often deman∣ded by the Spaniards in Milan, they haue been as resolutely answered, that they should take care to liue: Besides, the confi∣ning of the Grisons, of the Duke of Sauoy, and Venetians, are the cause, that the Kings of Spaine proceed with more discre∣tion in Milan: for when the Popes managed Armes, I my selfe also was for their occasion greatly respected. But soft, Almansor, yonder commeth my most capitall enemy Don Pe∣drode Toledo, wherefore I pray thee withdraw a little; for at any hand I would not haue him take notice, that I lament my disgraces heere with thee; and for this onely, were it for no∣thing else, may I tearme my seruitude most wretched, in that I am forced to call this miserable State, wherein thou seest me, the happy golden Age. CHAP. 5. Sigismund Battor learneth the Latine tongue. YEsterday about eight of the clocke in the Euening, the ordinary post of Germany arriued at this Court, and brought very ioyfull newes how Sigismund B ttor, Prince of Transiluania, was growne so ina∣mored of the gracefull Latine tongue, that to his great glory he spake, and wrote with the purity and eloquence of the Ce∣sarean style; whereupon all the Vertuous earnestly besought Apollo, that for such good newes there might be made in Par∣nassus all those demonstrations of ioy, w ch (to incourage Great men to the loue of Learning) were wont to be made, when any Prince became learned: But his Maiestie, that seeth into the vttermost secret of all things, denied those Vertuous their re∣quest, and told them that then onely there should be feasting in Parnassus, when out of the freenesse of a noble minde, and meere election of studies, not constrained by any necessitie, Princes applyed themselues to Learning; and that they were to know, how Prince Battor had gotten the elegant Latine tongue, neither out of ambition to shew himselfe to be lear∣ned, nor out of a vertuous curiosity to know many things, but onely out of necessitie for his reputations sake, to correct the foolish and childish absurditie which he committed, in Gen∣der, Number, and Case, at such time, as in the warre of Hun∣gary, he took that fatall resolution to arme himselfe against the Turke, for to adhere vnto the Emperour of Germany, whom in regard of the strong and liuely pretensiors, which he hath to the Principality of Transiluania, hee was to haue in more horrour, then seuentie Ottoman Emperours. CHAP. 6. The Cardinall of Toledoes Summa is not admit∣ted into the Library of Parnassus. THE Illustrious and Reuerend Francesco Cordova, Cardinall of Toledo, a personage of exemplarie life, an exqu site Diuine, and excellent Philosopher; hee that in his owne person honoured the Word of God in the pulpit, more then any other Preacher whatsoeuer of his time, some few dayes since arriued at Parnassus, hauing been receiued vpon the confines of the State, by Alessandrod' A∣les, and Cornelio Musso Bishop of Bitonto, and all the way en∣certained at his Majesties charge. This honourable learned man presented his Writings vnto the venerable Colledge of the Vertuous; and those of Philosophy were not onely com∣mended, but admired, as also the Commentaries composed by him vpon the Diuine passages of all the sacred Writers, were receiued with extraordinay applause, and shortly after they were carried in a pretious Vrne vnder a cloath of Estate, into the Delphicke Library, and with the name of the Author, consecrated to Eternitie. Onely his Summa, al∣though very learned, was not receiued by those Vertuous, who freely told him, that there were so many Workes already of that kind in his Maiesties Library, as some of them seemed superfluous: for an infinite many of great Diuines had with such diligence handled ma ters appertaining to the consci∣ences of priuate men, that they had put the saluation of soules into comprimise, for the onely regard of a shillings gaine: And that the world very much desired to see a complete Summa, composed vpon the consciences of grea Princes; a matter most necessary for the quiet of the whole Vniuerse, and altogether omitted by Diuines; wherein those actions of Princes should be exactly discoursed vpon, with which so often they put the world into confusion, filling it with rob∣beries, assassinates, and such slaughters of men, that many of them blinded with ambition to raigne vpon earth, haue made riuers to runne with humane bloud. The Colledge of the Learned, hearing these particulars, said, That they much desired to haue these questions dispu∣ted and resolued: Namely, whether Christian pietie will ad∣mit the speciall hypothesis, which the violence of the sword hath vsurped ouer others States: Whether a Principalitie, that by Armes and fraud, is forcibly taken from another Prince, may be held by one that hath the true feare of God: Whether that course of ruling a Kingdome, which is con∣quered onely to the end to impouerish and waste it, that so it may be gouerned without jealousie, may be practised by one that is borne in the Christian Faith: Whether the exal∣ting of Reason of State to such an height, that it should tram∣ple vnder feet, as at this present it doth, all Lawes diuine and humane, be not a more detestable and execrable Idolatry, then worshipping Nabuchadnezzars Image, or the golden Calfe. And lastly, the Colledge said, That then their desires would be fully accomplished, when there could be found a Diuine so much fearing God, that with his Writings durst fright Princes as much from doing euill, as many others with their great Volumes had terrified priuate men; for it seemed a strange thing vnto them, that infinite learned Diuines d so laboured to reason of the strict account, which Shop-kee∣pers are to render, euen for idle words, vnto the Majestie of God, and in the meane time had omitted to make mention of those exorbitant errours, committed by great Princes; when with their Armies ouer-running States, they send all things into perdition, both sacred and prophane: And that with more benefit to mankind, and eternall reward to them∣selues, Diuines might haue discoursed vpon the actions of Lewis the twelfth, and Francis the first, both Kings of France; of Ferdinand King of Aragon, and Charles the fifth the Emperor, whose soules departed out of this world with the heauy burthen of halfe a million of man-slaughters, all committed by their ambition to reigne, and whereof they were to giue a strict account to Almighty God: all which were matters exceeding necessarie, to the end, that mankind so much afflicted by the ambition of Princes, might one day receiue the consolation, which with such longing it de∣sireth, when those that reigne should be terrified from do∣ing amisse, and be made to know, that Hell was prepared as well for the great as the small. CHAP. 7. The Monarchy of Spaine throweth her Physitian out of the window. THis Morning the Monarchy of Spaine hauing sent for her ordinary Physitiā, a little after with her own hands she threw him out of the window of her roy∣all Palace, whereupon the poore wretch, being all battered in peeces, died incontinently. An accident that seemed the more strange, in regard the Physitian was held by all the Court, to be a man of extraordinary honesty, and in the practise of his profession most admirable. Sundry were the discourses that were made vpon so remarkable a matter. But, Apollo desiring to know of the Spanish Monarchy her∣selfe, the true cause of so grieuous a resentment, that migh∣ty Queene told him, how aboue forty yeares since, vpon oc∣casion of some accidents that befell her, and other signes which shee had discouered, shee feared that in processe of time, shee should catch some dangerous French disease from the Royall house of Burbon, and therefore to prouide for the inconuenience which shee foresaw, shee had deman∣ded counsell of her Physitian, who prescribed her a long fa∣stidious and chargeable purgation, compounded of diuers Oyles of holy Leagues, of insurrections of people, of rebel∣lions of Nobility, of Cauteries, and other very bitter in∣gredients, whereby she had spoiled her stomacke, weakened her strength, and altogether lost her appetite; and that the infinite quantity of Syrrupes, and the many medicine which she had taken with such anguish, had wrought no o∣ther effect, but the acceleration of the disease, which with∣out that vnlucky and vnseasonable purgation peraduenture shee should neuer haue had: Moreouer, that the many Lea∣ches which were applyed to many parts of her body, had in such manner sucked the best vitall blood of the Gold of that Spaine, that through the weaknesse of her complexion, she was not able to euacuate those euill humours of Flanders, which had held her, and doe hold her oppressed. By which disorders, all occasioned through the naughty counsell of that imprudent Physitian, shee was so exasperated against him, that she had solemnely sworne to throw him out of the window, if to free her from future infirmities, he euer after ordained her any purgation; And that perceiuing how the paine which she hath at this instant in the Shoulder of Hol∣land, was an apparant Lues Gallica, shee had demanded counsell of the same Physitian for to cleare her selfe of it, who vnmindfull of his former errors, had foolishly ordai∣ned the second purgation, wholly and altogether like the former, and that therefore being ouercome with paine, shee had throwne him out of the window, so punishing him at once for both the faults hee had committed: for it seemed vnto her, that hee had well deserued the misfortune of that resentment, seeing that by the accidents following, with such infelicity of her Spaniards, he had not learned to know, that purgations made before their time for diseases that are fea∣red, doe not worke those good effects, which either the Physitian beleeueth, or the patient desireth. CHAP. 8. Most of the States of the world are censured in Parnassus for their errors. APollo carefull of nothing more, than to see the Prin∣ces of the world, should in the vpright gouernment of their States, giue the people such satisfaction as they ought, introduced into Parnassus (many ages since) this admirable custome: That euery yeare, the names of the chiefest Potentates of the earth, written vpon little scedules, should be put into an Vrne, and then being drawn forth one by one, the publike censor of politicall matters should (in the presence of the sacred Colledge of the lear∣ned) record the disorders, which he had obserued in the go∣uernment of their States; whereupon those Princes were bound either incontinently with satisfying reasons to defend such things as were obiected against them, or else within a Moneth to reforme them. An institution no doubt very noble and holy; for it hath effected, that in the progresse of so many ages, since first it was vsed, Princes haue corrected an infinitie of errours: be∣sides, knowing that they are to bee called to so strict an ac∣count, it maketh them endeauour to liue so vertuously, that in the presence of so many Princes they neede not to blush. Vpon the day appointed then, most of the Potentates of the World appeared before Apollo: And Count Baldazar Ca∣stiglione the Politicall Censor, said vnto the reuerend Lord Giouanni dalla Casa, Nuntio for the Sea Apostolicall in this State, which was first drawne out of the Vrne; That it see∣med vnto him a most scandalous matter, and indeed vnwor∣thy the Greatnesse and Maiesty of the Popes, that in Rome should be seene some potent Families, vnto whom it serued in stead of a rich patrimony to bee dependant on forraigne Princes, not very well affected to the greatnesse of the Apo∣stolicke Sea, which in euery occasion were apt with the po∣wer of their Factions to giue the Popes much trouble; and that he might truly say, how in all his time he had not seene a more foule and execrable thing, than that which the Em∣perour Charles the fifth did, when with the noble Charge of the Kingdome of Naples, he rewarded the cruell seditions, and shamefull treacheries, which the Cardinall Pompeo Co∣lonna, vsed against the high Bishop Clement the seuenth. Then the Lord Giouanni demanded of the Count, how long it was since hee had conuersed in the Romane Court; who answering, Some seuenty yeares past: the Nuncio replyed, that returning thither now he should find, how by reason of the abundance of vertjuyce, which the Pompei, Fabritij, Pros∣peri, Ascanij of the family of Colonna; the Virginij, and o∣ther more principall Barons of the House of Orsina had ea∣ten; the teeth of their Nephews and Grand-children were so set on edge, that they could hardly chaw their broth: for the Popes which had tyed those exorbitances about their fingers, knew so excellently how to practise the Tarquini∣an precept, that they haue reduced those Poppies, which heretofore were as high as Cedars, to the humble stature of ridiculous dwarffes. This answere satisfied the Count, who turning to the Ro∣mane Empire, next drawne out of the Vrne, hee said vnto him, That the present disorders which were seene not only in the great patrimony of the House of Austria, but in all Germany, proceeded from the negligence of the present Em∣peror Rodolphus, and therefore hee much desired, that that Maiesty would with more care embrace the gouernment of his so many States; remembring, that Princes, rulers of mankind, bore vpon their shoulders the heauiest weight, and had in their hands the most laborious worke that any the painfullest day-labourer whatsoeuer could exercise. The Cen∣sor was exceedingly thanked by the Romane Empire for this aduice; whereunto with much grauity he answered, That it was a disgrace common with all Princes, to be accused of negligence, when scandals arose in their States, although it notoriously appeared, that in regard they were occasioned by the practises of more mighty enemies, they could not possibly be auoyded by an vnderstanding Prince. Wherefore it was to be considered, That the monstrous felicities, which the most mighty House of Austria haue had by inheriting with their Matches, the States of Flanders, the Kingdomes of Spaine, of Naples, Sicilia, Bohemia, Hungary, and Portugall, haue giuen all the Princes of Germany, of Ita∣ly, and of Europe such diobolicall jealousies, that they haue caused both the passed and present ruines, now beheld in their ancient patrimony: Whereunto the Emperors, which haue raigned since Maximilian the first of famous memory, albeit they were reputed most valorous and prudent Princes, could neuer after apply any salue, that did not infinitely exas∣perate the sore of the disorders of Germany, wherin had con∣curred such abundance of malignant humours, that it might truly be said, it was immedicable. Further, it was to be remem∣bred, what small authority the moderne Emperors haue had in Germany, so that it were not onely a discourtesie, but open injustice to will one, that hath his hands fast bound behind him to performe the acts of Or ando. Moreouer, the quali∣tie of the Empire was to be regarded, which being electiue, they that serued, had more authority in it, then they that commanded. Besides the present weaknesse of the house of Austria in Germany, from whom (with the seditions of Religion) the hearts of their subiects are stollen; a theft so important, that they may well abandon those States as lost, wherein such dangerous seed is sowen. Whereupon the present Emperour seeing himselfe depriued of the obedience of his subiects, desireth euery one to reflect vpon the quality of the Cousins, which the House of Austria hath in Spaine, and they shall find that the people of Almaine borne for their libertie, to secure themselues from the monstrous pow∣er of such a Family, take impious and wrongfull reuenges euen on those, which shal not be free frō the seruitude of the Spaniards, if for the sins of men they euer arriue to that point of commanding ouer the World; from which (by the meere goodnesse and mercy of God) they are put off as farre, as by their many deuices they haue laboured to come neere it. That also it was to be thought vpon, how the first that in Italie, and abroad, disinherited with all kinde of irreuerence, and disrespect, the Maiestie of the Empire, were those their Cou∣sins of Spaine, as clearely appeared by the vsurpation of Fi∣nale, and other Imperiall feudes by them possessed. All which things, mouing dangerous humors without dissol∣uing them afterwards, doe cause the House of Austria in Germany, to be cruelly scourged by most powerfull enemies, whilest the Spaniards with their only menaces seeke to put the whole world into suspition and distate. And for con∣clusion, he desired all the sacred Colledge to consider, that to the miserable sterilitie of children, which is seene in the present Emperor, is adioyned a lamentable fertilitie of bre∣thren; one of which incited by the most violent spurre of ambition, hath not doubted at last to goe about to ouer∣throw his owne House, which is ready to fall. All accidents so vnhappy, that they would make euen Salomon himselfe seeme to the World a very foole. These replies, which to all the Assistants seemed very weighty, satisfied the Censor, who turning him to the war∣like French Monarchie, said vnto her; How all the Vertuous of Parnassus much desired of her, that shee would rule the furious, vnquiet, capricious, and exceeding impetuous dis∣positions of her French, reducing them to those termes of prudence, aduisednesse, and stayednesse of minde, which are seene in the noble Italian, and Spanish Nations; and how it much blemished her reputation, that the Kingdome of France, which holdeth a first place amongst the most prin∣cipall Monarchies of the World, should be inhabited by men so infinitely rash. To this aduertisement the French Monarchie replied, That the Censor not well informed of the interests of her Kingdome, had censured for defects the chiefest vertues, which she loued in her French. Folly, light∣nesse, vnaduisednesse, and a precipitous nature were they, which had made her so feared, and formidable a Queene, be∣cause her French with vnspeakable alacritie and forwardnes, would vpon the least nod of hers, expose themselues to those perils, whereunto other Princes could not with the rope, the cudgell, and the cruellest kinds of punishment compell their wise, aduised, and circumspect subiects: And that in the many warres, which she had held with most va∣lorous Nations, she had learned to know, how an Armie framed of souldiers, which had little braine, and much cou∣rage, so that they are led by a valiant, and discreet Generall, doth carry away the victorie from those people, who pro∣fesse more circumspection, and wisdome. This answer of the Monarchie of France, was so much the more commen∣ded of Castiglione, by how much, regarding the qualitie of a mighty Kingdome, he knew that the French possessed all those endowments and vertues, which were requisite in a Nation, for to found, amplifie, and maintaine a great Empire. Then the Censor turning to the powerfull Monarchie of Spaine, said vnto her, how it was euident, nothing gaue grea∣ter satisfaction to all people in generall, but more particular∣ly to those which were subiect to strange Nations, than the humanitie, and affable cariage of such as gouerned them; whereas she sending to the gouernments of Naples, Milan, and Sicilia, none but her owne Spaniards, they with their ordinarie Castilian statelinesse, and insupportable Spanish pride, without all comparison far exceeding that, which the Kings of Spaine themselues either could, or would haue vsed in those States, did so exasperate euen their good and faithfull subiects, that the Spanish Dominion was growne infinitely odious: And that further, both in weighty, and sleight affaires, hee desired more quicke expeditions from her, seeing that by her too much delay, and perplexitie in the deliberation of important matters, shee had lost many faire occasions, that had presented themselues vnto her, for the inlarging of her Empire. The Monarchy of Spaine very much thanked the Censor for the aduertisements he had gi∣uen her, and in her excuse answered, how that honourable Gentleman, which had a young wife, beyond all expression faire, but of a disposition inclined to lasciuiousnesse, should shew himselfe very discreet, if he desired, that a proper han∣some seruant, whom he kept in his house, should be rather extremely hated, than any whit affected by his wife: and that vnto the delay in the resolution of her affaires, which she knew to be vitious and preiudiciall, it lay not in her power to giue remedie: for almighty God hauing not without im∣portant occasions created her Spaniards wholly, and altoge∣ther quite different in disposition from the French, whilest they in the deliberation of businesses, were rather precipi∣tous, than executiue, she in her being so slow and irresolute, obeyed the will of God, who would haue it so. The next drawne out of the Vrne was the Monarchie of Poland; vnto whom Count Baldasar said, How all the Prin∣ces of Europe c u d haue wished, that the present King Si∣gismond had vsed towards those seditious Nobles, which last rebelled against him, some seueritie worthy so grieuous a fault, only to the end, that by their example, other Lords might haue beene deterred from committing the like. To this the Polach Monarchy answered, That those chastise∣ments giuen to the Nobility, which in an hereditarie State would be commodious, haue alwaies proued in her electiue Kingdome preiudiciall: And how that Kingdome, which another receiueth in gift from a Nobility, in whose power is the election of the King, cannot without euident perill of falling from his greatnesse. be gouerned with that rigour, which in other hereditary States is necessary; for that Se∣nate, which out of an election of loue giueth another a King∣dome, if it be prouoked by the powerfull passion of hate, knoweth also how to reassume it, in regard well-aduised Se∣nators are wont to reserue vnto themselues those necessary instruments, whereby vpon euery occasion of euill satisfacti∣on, they may recall their vsed liberalitie: And that the pre∣sent King Sigismond being the first of his House, which had raigned in Poland, hee was to direct the aime of all his thoughts to no other scope so much, as by an extraordinary indulgence to win the hearts of the Nobilitie of his State, that so with a gratefull memory of his clemency, he might perpetuate the succession of such a Kingdome in his Bloud. An aduertisement most necessary for Sigismond his King, by reason the Polachs, although their King be electiue, doe ne∣uer defraud the Royall Bloud of the succession, if hee that raigneth, can tell how to get the generall loue of the Nobi∣litie. For the Polonians being a Nation, that know not how to liue in an absolute liberty, doe so abhor all manner of seruitude, that that King among them (a matter common to all electiue princes) shall be most oculatiue, and vigilant in the matters of his State, that least seemeth either to see or know any thing. Not only the Censor, but the whole Col∣ledge of the Vertuous, admitted the iustification of the Po∣lach Monarchy for excellent. Hereupon the Count turning himselfe to the vast Ot∣toman Empire, said vnto him, That the cruelty which hee vsed, onely vpon light suspitions, against his chiefest mini∣sters, was held by all the world to be a bloudy course; it be∣ing a receiued opinion, that men of extraordinary valour and merit, should not be laid hands on, but for great and proued offences: And that when the Ottoman Princes did euen iustly take away the liues of their ministers, the custome of seizing vpon their Estates to their owne vse, and thereof vtterly depriuing the children, did scandalize all good iu∣stice, because it seemed, that with such cruell rigour, the Estates, rather than the faults of the delinquents, wee hun∣ted after. To this so open a correction, the Ottoman Em∣pire answered with admirable grauity, That he was growne to that greatnesse wherein he was seene, by the onely two most powerfull meanes of reward without measure, and pu∣nishment without end: And that the sole foundation of the quiet of euery State, being placed in the fidelity of the most important ministers, Princes were not to seeke any thing with more care, than with immense rewards to allure them vnto faithfulnesse, and with infinite punishments to terrifie them from trecheries: That those ministers which haue in their power, the Forces, Command, and Gouernments of States, not being able to erre, but in most important mat∣ters, it were the counsell of a foolish Prince, vpon suspitions of that moment, to arraigne, accuse, and heare the iustifica∣tions of the offender; but in such a case, the Prince which will runne no danger, ought to endeuour to surprise his minister vpon the sudden, and to deale so securely, that the execution of the punishment may precede euen the accusa∣tion it selfe: That many times it had fallen out, that he with a sudden chastisement had preuented the consummation of most foule treasons: Which resolution, though he acknow∣ledged to be most seuere, yet he knew it had so wrought, that there were neuer seene in his State any Counts S t . Paul, Princes of Orange, Dukes of Guise, d'Aumale, du Maine, de Mercure, and other foule monsters of disloyaltie, which, with the shame of those Princes, that with halters, poynards, and axes, knew not how to preuent such dangerous offen∣ces, haue beene seene otherwhere: It being a rule in mat∣ters of State as common, as secure, That that minister, which giueth to his Prince the least shadow of suspition of his faith, incurreth a capitall paine, because those Captaines which haue the care of Armies in their power, are bound, like the wiues of Honourable personages, to liue with such puritie of minde, that they be free not only from blame, but from the least suspition of a blame-worthy thought. That touch∣ing the seizure of his Bashawes estates after their death, he thought he might truly say, that the entertainments, gifts, and wealth, wherewithall other Princes rewarded their mi∣nisters, in comparison of those inexhaustible riches which he bestowed on his well-deseruing Officers, were vile, and poore, as those Royall Treasures, which Ruften, Maho∣met, Ibrahin, and infinite others left behind them after their decease, haue fully testified: That the greatest regard which a Prince ought to haue in rewarding his ministers, consisteth in prouiding, that the vnmeasurable riches, where∣with he bought of them infinite fidelitie, may not possibly at any time be conuerted to the prejudice of him, that vsed the liberalitie: That from the grieuous disorders fallen out in the States of other Potentates, he had found it to be a mat∣ter most pernitious vnto Princes, that the extraordinary ri∣ches left by a deseruing Minister, should passe vnto his chil∣dren, not hauing first deserued it (by their vertue, valour, and fathers said fidelitie) of the Prince: That he had not out of couetousnesse, as many misiudged, confiscated the great in∣heritances of his Bashawes, but that by the commoditie thereof, those subiects should not be idle, and consequently vicious, which being descended of fathers of notable valour, gaue the Prince assured hope they would imitate the ver∣tues of their Progenitors: That the gate of his Treasure stood perpetually open to the heires of his Ministers, to restore them their fathers inheritances twice doubled, when they with their fidelitie and valour should deserue them; and how much the riches of men vicious, and subiect to ambition, were apt to disturbe the peace of any Kingdome, how great soeuer, well appeared by the fresh examples, which he had seene both in France and Flanders. Whilst the Ottoman Empire spake in this manner, he ob∣serued that the renouned French Monarchy, with the sha∣king of her head, seemed to declare, that she no way appro∣ued those reasons: whereupon somewhat the more moued, he said thus: Mighty Queene, my custome in seizing vpon the estates of my Bashawes, is profitable for the greatnesse, and quiet of my State; and in regard of the friendship that is betwixt vs, I would to God, the same course were obserued in your France; for you know full well, to what vse Henry the Duke of Guize conuerted the exceeding riches, where∣withall the liberall Kings Francis the first, and Henry the se∣cond rewarded the merits of Duke Francis his father. You, and I, and all those that raigne doe know, how the sweetest bait that can allure men, is a Crowne, and there being no man, which for to taste neuer so little of it, but would hold it a great pleasure for to expose euen his life to manifest danger of losing it, Princes ought to be most vigilant in keeping with extremest seueritie the passages thereunto closed vp against all men: nay, they ought to accōmodate their affaires in such sort, that no priuate man whatsoeuer should once hope to taste of so sweet a thing: And I tell you freely, that if your Duke of Guiz had in my State but onely thought that, which with such publike scandall he boldly put in executi∣on in your Kingdome of France; I would the very first day haue giuen him that blow, whereunto your King Henry the third, although he were incited vnto it by the greater part of the Princes of Italy, could neuer be drawne, vntill the very last houre of his shamefull disgraces, and euen at that instant, when the sort of the French vprores was become an incura∣ble vlcer; for where ambition raigneth among Nobles, Prin∣ces are constrained to shew themselues all seueritie, continu∣ally keeping scaffolds in readines, & prepared, to punish the seditious and rebellious; and their Treasury open, to reward the quiet, and the loyall; that Prince being vnworthy to com∣mand, that hath not the vnderstanding how to make him∣selfe be obeyed; neither can there be a more scandalous mat∣ter seene, not met withall in a State, then that the Prince should liue in jealousie of an Officer, which ought to trem∣ble before him. But it is the propertie of you the Princes of Christendome, making profession of Learning, and dire∣cting your selues by rules of policie, to call me Barbarous, and my secure way of proceeding, Tyrannicall, whilst in the meane time, yee suffer your selues to be reduced by your He∣roycall vertues of clemencie, and gentlenesse, to shamefull tearmes of enduring vnworthy things. It is not possible to deliuer, how much the Ottoman Em∣pire offended all the Vertuous of the sacred Colledge with his discourse, who standing vp, told him in great disdaine, how they could proue with present reasons, that all which he had said, were most wicked conceipts, vnworthy to be spo∣ken by any person that had a soule, or to be heard of men, that made profession of honour. Whereunto the Ottoman Empire answered, smiling, That others in the gouernment of Kingdomes might haue regard to Vertue, and I know not what, but for his part he would neuer be perswaded, but that the quiet and peace of States ought to be preferred before all other humane interests whatsoeuer. Then the Censor, to cut off so odious a dispute, turning to the great Duchie of Moscouy, said vnto him, That the most noble perogatiue of raigning ouer people, which were louers of Learning, and excellently Vertuous, was the second amongst the greatnesses of a Prince: Whereas he by so ende∣uouring to bring vp his subjects in a grosse ignorance, reaped no small blame, if not much disreputation; because euery one skorned him, for that, expelling the famous liberall Arts out of his State, he had onely permitted his people to learne the benefit of writing and reading. To this Censure the Duchie of Moscouy answered, That the dreadfull fire, which he had obserued Learning had euer kindled in those States, where it had been admitted, had made him resolue not to suffer in any sort, that so scandalous a Cockle should be sowed in his Duchie; for men being the heards of Princes, as sheepe the flocks of priuate persons, it were extreme folly to arme those gentle sheepe their subiects with the malice, which Learning engraffeth into their dispositions, that at∣taine vnto it; whereas otherwise, in regard of that harmelesse simplicitie, wherewith Almighty God hath created them, they may be commodiously ruled and gouerned, be they neuer so many in number, by one Prince alone: And how he held for infallible truth, that if the Germans and Hollan∣ders had been maintained by their Princes in the simplicitie of their ancient ignorance, and withall it had been prohibi∣ted, that the pure minde of those Nations might not haue beene contaminated with the plague of Greeke and Latine learning, without all doubt they had neuer had the judge∣ment, with such a ruine of their old Religion, and destructi∣on of many Princes, that before ruled ouer those Prouinces, to know how to frame those perfect formes of Common∣weales in their countries, whereunto neither the wit of So∣lon, the wisedome of Plato, nor all the Philosophy of Aristo∣tle could euer arriue. This answere so moued the Censor, and all the sacred Col∣ledge of the Learned, that with threatning lookes they said, how the reasons alledged by the Great Dutchy of Moscouy, were open blasphemies; and it seemed the Learned were rea∣dy to make good their words with deeds, when the greater part of the mightiest Monarchies were seene to betake them∣selues to their weapons, for defence of the Moscouite; who growing more audacious vpon the forward assistance of so many Potentates, boldly said, If any one would deny, that Learning did not infinitly disturbe the quiet, and good go∣uernment of States; and that a prince might not with more facilitie rule a Million of ignorants, then an hundreth lear∣ned, that were made to command, and not to obey, he lyed in his throat. The Vertuous vpon this daring defiance grew ex∣tremely incensed, and stoutly replyed, That the Moscouite had spoken with an insolence, worthy of an ignorant, and how they could also proue vnto him, that men without lear∣ning were Asses and Calues with two legs. Now were they almost ready to goe together by the eares, when the Censor cryed out, Forbeare, and carry due respect to this place, where we are assembled to amend disorders, and not to commit scandals; whereupon such was the reue∣rence euery one bare to the Maiestie of the Censor, that both the Princes, and the Learned, although they were transpor∣ted with anger and disdaine, became sodainely pacified. All being quiet, then the Censor said vnto the famous Venetian Libertie, which next was drawen out of the Vrne, That the hardest matter to be found in an Aristocracie, as she well knew, was to restraine the young Nobilitie, who with their licentiousnesse distasting the better sort of Citi∣zens, had many times occasioned the ruine of most famous Common-weales; And that he to his great griefe had heard, how the yong Nobilitie of Venice with their proud demea∣nour had offended many honourable Citizens of that State; who exceedingly complained, that whilest the insolency of the Nobilitie encreased, the chastisements for it decreased; And that therefore heremembred her, that it was a dange∣rous point in an Aristocracie, when those which were to glo∣ry for that they were farre from those dangers, whereunto such are subiect, as are to obey the humour of a Prince, be heard to complaine, that they are oppressed by many Ty∣rants. Hereunto the Venetian Libertie answered, That the disorder recounted by the Censor was true, and withall dan∣gerous; but that the authoritie of commanding, was so an∣nexed to pride and insolencie, that they seemed to be borne both at one birth: And that the licenciousnesse, which the Nobilitie of all Aristocracies vseth towards the Citizens, was by all the greatest men, that haue discoursed of Com∣mon-weales, reputed a desperate cure; for although it was most necessary, that insolencies should be restrained with se∣uere paines, yet on the other side, an Aristocracie was to ab∣staine as much as possibly might be from publike punish∣ments of Noblemen, albeit seditious; to the end that their shamefull suffering might not be an occasion to disinherit the whole Nobilitie it selfe of that respect which is due to them from the people; for hauing the gouernment of the State in their hands, the interest of the publike conseruation thereof requireth, that they be held in highest reputation: And although in her Venice, disobedient and insolent No∣blemen were not seene to be so often punished, betweene the two pillars in the Piazza of Saint Marke, as it seemeth ma∣ny desired, yet by the great Councell the Pregadi, the Col∣ledge, and other supremer Magistrates, that dispence the publike Charges, those seditious Noblemen, which were dis∣couered to carry a tyrannicall minde, were cruelly afflicted with the torment of shamefull repulses: And that many subjects of most Noble Houses are seene in Venice, whose an∣cient reputation for their demerits was maimed by Arque∣buses charged with bullets of paper; and that being struc∣ken downe with such kind of shot, they could neuer rise since to honours and dignities; things wherein consisteth the life of the Noblemen of an Aristocracie: And that to excruciate a body, a greater torture could not be deuised, no not by Perillus himselfe, then that which once a Noble∣man of Venice experienced, when in a concurrence of the Ho∣nourablest charges, he saw one yonger then himselfe passe before him, onely because he was knowne to the Senate to be more deseruing. Castiglione did not onely admit the justifi∣cation of the Venetian Libertie, but also did infinitely com∣mend the circumspection and seueritie which shee vsed in punishing her Nobilitie, vpon occasion of any demerit or defect. Then the Censor said vnto the Duchy of Sauoy, That his State being seated in the Confines of France and Italy, he was necessited with all carefulnesse to maintaine himselfe neutrall betweene those Princes, with whom hee confined; but in those last rumors of France, by discouering himselfe openly to be wholly Spanish he had put, not onely his owne, but the States of all the Princes of Italie in great trouble: And that whilst with the bellowes of his forces he blew the fire of the French vprores, kindled by the Spaniards ambiti∣on, hee ought to beleeue, that that flame was to burne vp friends and kinred, before euer it could get to the other Itali∣an Potentates that were enemies. The Duchy of Sauoy an∣swered the Censor very readily, That the adherence of his last Duke to the Spaniards, was true, but the faire occasion hee had of three seuens in his hand, euen forced him to set vp his rest, hoping to encounter the most famous Primiera, that euer any other Prince whatsoeuer had at Cards; to which venture he was the rather carryed, because he was assured hee could loose but that money, which at that game he had won before: That afterwards, though by his ill lucke the fourth Card, which was dealt him, proued to be a Coat of affront, wherewith he had made the worst hir, that could be encoun∣tred on the whole pack of Cards, neuerthelesse he knew, that the brauest mindes would confesse, that albeit the resolution was very dangerous, yet not to wrong the Cards, they would haue played no otherwise themselues. The Censor appre∣hending the Metaphor, very much commended the Magna∣nimous resolution of that Duke; who, for that hee might from a small feauer haue receiued in gift the Empire of the greater part of the world, not only without any note of im∣prudence, but to his infinit glory, at such time as so resolute∣ly he cast the Dye of all the greatnesse of his fortune vpon the Table of Chance, he might well speake those famous words anew, Or Caes r, or nothing. Then the Censer turned him to the Noble great Dutchy of Toscan, and sharply reprehending him, for going with his Galleyes as it were prouoking of Waspes, hee recorded vnto him, the misery and calamities which the Knights of Saint Iohn suffered at Rhodes, at Tripoli, and the great dan∣ger, that lastly they ranne at Malta, onely because they would imprudently haue tyed squibbes to the Buls taile; And that euerywise Christian Prince ought rather to fauour the pre∣sent carelesnesse of the Turkes, then to waken them with in∣juries of little profit; nay, such as brought others much dam∣mage, and necessite them to apply their mindes anew vnto maritime affaires, which in these times they had euen aban∣doned: Also he remembred him, how infinite people daily complained, for that, by his hindering Italy of the trade of the commodities of the L vant, all drugges that came from beyond the Seas, were growne to an excessiue rate. To this correction the great Dutchy of Toscan answered, That the power of a Prince could not be termed perfect, which with a number of armed Vessels had not some Dominion on the Sea: And that his Galleyes were not onely very necessary for the Toscan greatnesse, but also for the securitie of the Li∣bertie of all Italy, as seruing for a Schoole of Mariners, for a Seminary of Captaines and Souldiers at Sea: That he con∣fessed the dammage, which they did to the Trade of Mer∣chandise, but withall, he desired it might be considered, that the mysterie of Warre, either by Land or by Sea, could not be learned by Souldiers, nor exercised by Princes without prejudice to others: And that Toscan breeding much filthi∣nesse of fantasticall vnquiet braines, and extrauagant hu∣mours, he had therefore great occasion for those Gallies, that might serue, as it were, to carry forth all the filth of his State, and thereby keepe it cleane, imploying such onely for Gal∣ly-slaues in them, as had done euill before, and that in regard of their vnquiet nature, were like to doe worse after. This excuse of the Great Dutchy of Toscan was approo∣ued both by the Censor, and all the sacred Colledge. Where∣vpon the Count said vnto the Libertie of Geneua, who was last drawne out of the Vrne, That the excessiue vse of Ex∣changes, which shee permitted vnto her Nobilitie, caused that great disorder of inriching the priuate, and withall of impouerishing the publike, whose reuenues would haue risen to huge summes of Gold, if the reall riches of her Nobilitie had beene imployed in a iust Trade of Merchandise. The Genouese Libertie with a readinesse, that gaue a parti∣cular gust to all the Learned, answered, How it was true, that Exchanges doe worke that effect, which the Censer had men∣tioned, and therefore were most pernicious in any Monarchy whatsoeuer; howbeit that notwithstanding they might bee permitted in a well-ordered Common-wealth, without any prejudice of the publike interests; because the richest and se∣curest Treasures of a free State, are the riches of the Nobility, and Citizens together; a matter which falleth not out in a Monarchy, where betweene the commings in of the Prince; and the meanes of priuate men, there runneth a long wall of eight Stories high built by Mine and Thine: Further, that in a Monarchy the mutation of the State commonly followeth with little or no prejudice to the people, onely changing the name of Matthew, to that of Martin; but in the subuersions of Common-weales, where liberty is changed into seruitude, there the proper substance of priuate men, is the publike trea∣sure; for then will they profusely spend all that euer they haue, for to defend their owne libertie euen to the last gaspe. CHAP. 9. The Monarchie of Spaine inuiteth the Cardinall of Toledo, to be her Theologian, which he re∣fuseth, and why. THe report goeth in this Court, that the Mighty Mo∣narchy of Spaine, by her chiefe Secretarie inuiteth the worthy Cardinall of Toledo, with allowance of a large pension, to assist as her Theologian in the Royall Coun∣cell of State, to the end that nothing should be determined there, which might be against his conscience: This matter filled the whole Court with maruell, in regard euery one knew how little that Prelate in the rebenediction of the most Christian King Henry the 4. fauoured the affaires of his Prince; for which cause no man could imagine the oc∣casion, wherefore so wise a Queene in a businesse of such weight, should vse the seruice of so diffident a subiect. Those which make profession best to vnderstand the man∣ner of proceeding of the aduised Spanish Nation, euen in this resolution acknowledged the inueterate prudence of the Kings of Spaine, whose proper custome it is neuer to be at quiet, vntill that with pensions, with honourable char∣ges, with all kinde of louing demonstrations, and humane deuices, they haue drawne vnto their party all such great subiects, as they see to be alienated from their Interest, and from whom they know, that one day yet they may receiue seruices. The chiefest Confidents of so great a Cardinall, de∣liuer, that his Lordship very gladly accepted the noble Charge propounded vnto him; howbeit with this condi∣tion, (which by the Spaniards was presently reiected) that whensoeuer with the authority of the Sacred Scriptures, with the Doctrine of the holy Fathers, with the ordinances of the Canons, he should make the Royall Councell capa∣ble, how the resolutions made in it, were disagreeing from the Lawes of God, and men; hee alone then would haue power to hinder the execution of them; and all to the end, the world might know, That the Royall Theologian in that Councell was only to helpe the conscience of his King with the will of God, not to serue for a maske to establish the Dominion of Kingdoms ouer men; for it seemed too shamefull a matter vnto him, that such a one as he should be imployed to authorise the diabolicall impiety of the mo∣derne reason of State, and to make most stinking Assa fetida appeare vnto simple people very excellent Muske. CHAP. 10. The Spaniards attempt the acquisition of Sauoy, but doe not preuaile. SEeing that for to draw the French naile out of the table of Milan, where it was fixed, the ill-aduised Italian Princes had made vse of the Spanish pickaxe, which entred in such manner into the very table it selfe, that it was neuer possible since to draw it forth with any kinde of pin∣cers whatsoeuer, all the Potentates of Europe, and especially the Italian Princes, which perceiued, that the Spaniards af∣ter the seruitude of the Milanesi, openly aspired to the ab∣solute Dominion of all Italy, to the end they might secure that remainder of liberty, which is yet resting in her, agreed amongst themselues, that euery fiue and twentieth yeare, the Chaine which the Spaniards haue forged for the Italian ser∣uitude, should with exact diligence be measured by persons thereunto deputed. And comming (a few daies since) ac∣cordingly to measure it, the Italian Princes to their infinite amazement found, that so odious a Chaine was increased with fiue most preiudiciall links; presently whereupon the Politicall Smiths were called, who very carefully made an assay of the yron added to the Chaine, and they found that the first linke was forged at Piombino, the other at Finale, the third at Correggio, the fourth at Porto Lungone, and the last at M naco. Greatly did the Princes maruell at the strange∣nesse of this accident, and many of them were ashamed, that through their carelesse simplicitie the Spaniards had increa∣sed the Chaine of the Italian seruitude, much more in peace, than they could haue done in war with foure Armies. With these strange exorbitances, the Italian Princes were so in∣censed against the Spaniards, that they told them freely, how if they did not containe themselues within the bounds of honesty, and modesty; if the Italian files would not suffice to reduce that miserable Chaine to his due measure, they would make vse of the French; and if with them neither they could obtaine their intent, they would procure enough from England, and Germany; yea, and in case of desperation they would not sticke to furnish themselues with those excel∣lent damasked ones, that are made in Turkie. Whilest the Italian Princes were in this contestation, there arriued a Poste, which in all haste had beene dispatched out of Italy vnto them with this certaine aduertisement, That the Spa∣niards were forging another linke in Sauoy, to be added vn∣to the Chaine of their seruitude: in regard of which newes, the renowned Venetian Liberty instantly opened her fa∣mous Arsenall, and all the Princes of Italy ran to arme them∣selues; the warlike French Monarchy commanded her No∣bilitie to horse, all Germany put themselues in order to passe the mountaines, and the numerous Fleets of the English, and Hollanders, set saile towards the Straits of Gibraltar; when iust in the nick, euen as all the World was in Armes, a new Poste arriued, who pacified the minds of men with this in∣telligence, That indeed it was true, how the Spaniards had laboured with all possible industry to forge that most impor∣tant Linke of Sauoy, but that they had sweat in vaine, be∣cause in the soldering, it broke. CHAP. 11. The Duke d'Alva being arriued at Parnassus, in complementing with Prospero Colonna, they fall foule about defrauding the Colones of their Titles. DOn Hernando de Toledo Duke d'Alva, a few daies since, arriued at Parnassus, and by expresse order from Apollo, a diligent examination of his actions being made by the military men, he was found worthy to be admitted into Parnassus amongst those famous Captains, which without effusion of bloud, knew how to vanquish an enemy, more by patience, and art, than by open force, or valour; that durst hazard the fortune of Kingdoms vpon the doubtfull chance of a Battell. But because Lodouic Guicci∣ardino, an vnderstanding Writer of the affaires of Flanders, had preferred a Complaint, how that for certaine matters not very pleasing, which he had written of the Duke, hee had beene ill intreated by him, therefore he staied a long time to cleare himselfe of such an imputation; for there was an Edict of Apollo very rigorously obserued in Parnassus, whereby that Prince, or priuate man, was declared to be in∣famous, which durst offer any wrong to any Historian, or other Writer, for things written by him not very honoura∣ble, but yet true: Howbeit, of such power were the Dukes friends, that Guicciardino was contented to reuoke his com∣plaint, whereupon with all the greatest solemnitie hee was admitted into Parnassus, and had a place in his Maiesties Company of men at Armes, which was commanded by that famous Quintus Fabius Maximus; who for the excellencie of his well-aduised warinesse, was surnamed Cunctator. And it hapned, that amongst the other Princes, and Captaines, which the said Duke visited, one was the most excellent Lord Prospero Colonna, by whom he was receiued with all kinde of honour; and so much the more, because hee vn∣derstood that the Duke made a publike profession of being the disciple, follower▪ and imitator of his slow, but sure way of making warre. Howbeit, a strange and troublesome ac∣cident fell out in this visitation; for at the first meeting, the Duke hauing giuen the Lord Prospero the Title of your Ho∣nour, he was so incensed with disdaine, that taking himselfe to be highly wronged by so vile a title, with an angry voice he said; Duke, I had thought thou wert come hither, to honour one that is greater than thy selfe, not to vndervalue him; but because it is the fashion of the Colonesi to answer the iniuries of words with deeds, goe out of this house, and in the street (with my sword in mine hand) I will proue vn∣to thee, that all those, which vse such base termes to men of my ranke, deserue not to be admitted into the company of honourable persons. The Duke remained much astoni∣shed to see that great Captaine take the matter so hainously at his hands; and going to withstand the Lord Prospero, who offered to thrust him out of the chamber, they fell to grapple one with another: And because the Spaniards, which were in company with the Duke, seeing him in such termes with Colonna, entred into the chamber to assist him, the Italians which belonged vnto the Lord Prospero did the like; whereupon in regard of the number of persons in so strait a place, there ensued a cruell fray; the noise whereof comming into the street, was the cause that the newes of so dangerous an accident was suddenly carried to Apollo; who in all haste dispatched thither the Regent of the Vicaria with the guard of Archers, who freed the Duke out of the Lord Prosperoes hands: and the vprore being quieted, he com∣manded the Spaniards, that had beene very ill handled, to returne home to their houses; Thereupon the Lord Prospero, to preuent any sinister information that might haue beene giuen against him, presented himselfe before Apollo, vnto whom (the same goeth) with a troubled countenance hee vsed these words: Sir, it is well knowne, that men of the family of Colonna, of the quality I am of, haue alwaies in∣ioyed the title of Excellencie, Antequam Abraham fieret, and ere the Spaniards were in rerum natura; wherefore for that Nation to abuse a man of my ranke, as the Duke d'Alva did me but now, is most insupportable; for if the vilenesse of him that offended, doth infinitely aggrauate the iniurie with him that is offended, how is it possible, that an Italian Baron of my quality, should containe himselfe within the bounds of modestie, seeing himselfe vndervalued by that Nation, whose miseries, not aboue foure daies agoe to speake of, so moued the whole World to compassion, that thorow∣out all Churches they were recommended to the charitie of well-disposed Christians, of whom almes were gathered, to free them from the miserable seruitude, wherein they were so grieuously oppressed by the Moores of Granada. The Spaniards enioy the dominion of the greater part of Ita∣ly; where, by such as I am, notwithstanding that daily they threaten it with a cruell, and vniuersall seruitude, they are loued, honoured, and euen serued. With their prodigious auarice they haue depriued vs of our wealth; and in that la∣mentable sacke of Rome with their vnexpressable lust they violated the honour of our chastest Matrons. And now, in exchange of so abiect a patience, they would also take from vs this little honour of breath we enioy, and these misera∣ble Titles, the vnhappy remaines, and deplorable reliques of the Italian reputation: Which is a matter so hard to bee digested, that by euery honourable Italian Baron it ought to be reuenged, not with complaining words, as I doe, but with daggers points. It is reported by them that were then present, how all the while the Lord Prospero was speaking, Apollo did nothing but smile, and that when vpon his conclusion he burst out into those words, how the Spaniards abuses towards the Italians were to be reuenged with daggers points, he fell to laughing out-right, and said, Prospero, thou art, and euer wert too much giuen ouer to choller: and I am inforced to tell thee, how it infinitely mislikes me, that such a one as thou, who hast alwaies made a particular profession of pru∣dence, shouldst maruell, that slaues, which for twenty yeares together haue beene fed in the Gallies with course and mouldy Biske , when they light vpon a batch of new white Mancher, should fill their bellies till they are ready to cracke againe: Whereas that raging appetite of theirs, and euery other dishonest act, which they vse, to asswage their hun∣ger, ought to be so farre from seeming odious vnto honest men which behold it, that it should rather moue them to pitie. Therefore doe yee Italians likewise permit, that the Spaniards, men but new in this World, and lately got out of the seruitude of the Moores of Granada, may glut themselues with meat so delicate to their taste, as are the honourable Ti∣tles, which they haue found in Italy▪ for I assure thee, that when they shall be cloyed with such vanities they also will become, as the French are, such courteous Gallanes, that they will willingly giue the Title of Excellency euen to their horse-boyes, much more to such as thou art. And I tell thee, that if thou hadst that prudence, and that perfect knowledge of the World, as I wish thou haddest, thou wouldest very well perceiue, that those exorbitances, and that so odious manner of proceeding, which the Spaniards vse in Italie, whereof thou so complainest, is euen as so much sweet su∣gar for you Italians, and bitter poyson for the Spaniards; who if to their valour to their aduisednesse, and vnspeakable ambition which they haue to raigne, they had affable and courteous manners annexed, with the vtter destruction of that remnant of Libertie, which is yet out of the Lions iawes, they would soone become absolute Masters of the World. All which are in olencies, that with daggers points, not by you Italians, but by the Monarchy of Spaine her∣selfe, ought to be reuenged with all kinde of cruelty on her Spanish ministers, who with their vanitie distaste the good seruants of so great a Queene, and make her gouernment nothing acceptable to her subiects: A disorder that bring∣ing much difficultie to the substance of that vniuersall Mo∣narchy, whereunto it is not possible she can arriue with the publike hatred of all Italy, hath high need of remedy. With this answer Apollo returned the Lord Prospero ex∣ceeding well satisfied to his house, after whom the Duke d'Alva appeared before his Maiesty with all his family won∣derfull melancholy, which cast such milke in their faces, that the Spaniards seemed not so blacke, as ordinarily those Moores that come out of Granada vse to be. Then Apollo interrupting the complaint which the Duke was about to make against the Lord Colonna, said; Duke, I am much displeased with the disorder, which I vnderstand hath h p∣ned, and so much the more, by how much the cause of such an vprore is not very iust, nor withall very honourable on thy side: And vpon this occasion it pleaseth me to remem∣ber vnto you Spaniards, that to be not only niggards, as to all men yee are knowne, but not to vse prodiga itie in giuing vnto oth rs those Titles, which are desired, is a manifest signe of malignitie, because the ingenuous nobilitie of a Baron is knowne, by shewing little couetousnesse in receiuing Titles, and much liberalitie in giuing them: For euen by ouer-much, not by due honour, doth greater reputation accrue to him that giueth, than to him that receiueth it. And you Spani∣ards that vse such austeritie in desiring great Titles only for your selues, are not a whit increased in reputation, but rather are become so odious and ridiculous to all men, that the Ita∣lians in their Comedies, haue deseruedly introduced the per∣sonage of the Spaniard to represent vnto the world a perfect Braggado hia, I wonder ye should not perceiue, hat in think∣ing to arriue vnto the Dominiō of the earth by abusing m n, is the wrong way to the wood; The minds of men (Duke) are taken with the bait of humanitie, with the whistle of gra∣titude, of courtesie, of gentlenesse; and that Fowler would shew himselfe very ignorant, that should go with a drumme into a Doue-house for to take Pigeons, as I see you Spaniards foolishly doe. Moreouer, I tell you, that if euer any Nation were to make a bait of dignities, for to allure the Italians to fall into the nets of your Dominions, and light vpon the Limebush of your seruitude, it is you Spaniards, for the ends which ye haue vpon Italy: Withall yee are to consider, that the States, which yee possesse, of Napl s, and Milan, are fast∣ned vnto you with waxe; for ye shall command ouer those two members no longer, then til the Italians resolue to chase you from thence; who if they could be assured, that after your ruine, they should not fall into the power of the French, ye should quickly know, that only with a little disturbance, which they could giue you in the Port of Genoua, they would put you into a thousand intricate difficulties: all matters that should admonish you to giue satisfactiō, at least wise in words, to them, whom in regard of your interests in Italy, yee are ob∣liged to respect. As for the iniurie, which you say you haue receiued from the Lord Prospero, I tell you plainly, that what∣soeuer affront shall be done you vpon any such like Titular occasion, I will not only be insensible of it, but I will thinke you haue desirously sought it. Then the Duke would haue excused himselfe with saying, that from his King he had in∣struction how to carry himselfe towards the Italian Barons in the particular of Titles, when Apollo told him, that the Spanish abuses to the Italians were not to extend but only to the Neapolitans, and Milanesi; and his Maiestie also added, That if too much passion did not blind the Spaniards, they might easily see, how their Grandes, whom Spaine it selfe could not containe, and that in Italy, would play the Giants, compared with the Romane Barons; and those of meane sta∣ture would proue but dwarffs. Hereupon a cloud▪ as white as snow, beginning by little and little to couer the person of Apollo, the Priests that were about him perceiued how his Maiestie would prophecie; so that euery one falling pro∣strate on the ground, and with the rest, the Duke and his fol∣lowers; out of that hollow cloud proceeded the diuine voice of his Maiestie, which with a pleasing sound spake in this sort: I foretell vnto you Spaniards, that with your rough and odious manner of proceeding, yee will one day compell the Italian Nobilitie, which is the Mistris of the cruell Sicilian Vespres, to plot some bloudy Neapolitan Euen∣song against you; it being the proper custome of the Itali∣ans, with greater rage to reuenge the abuses of words, than the offences of blowes; as they that hauing short patience, and long hands, are borne not only with an heart most in∣clined to great resolutions, but that doe not vse to reuenge iniuries with all kinde of cruelty, before they are quite for∣gotten by those that did them. And with your owne ru∣ine, you will then finde them, with swords in their hands, to be Paladine Orlandoes, when ye shall perswade your selues they are become most suffering Asses. The Poste of Parnassus to the READER. THese Papers comming by chance into my hands, I perceiued there was something in them that I could not perceiue; wherefore I thought best to communicate them with better vnderstandings; for my part I could see no hurt in them, but did imagine by that little good which I saw, there was much more that I could not see, and therefore iudged them fit for all mens eyes. Yet finding the names of Spaine and Austria, or Austria and Spaine, (pardon me, politicke Reader, for I am not certaine which should haue prioritie; and I know in such Catholike points, a little error is deadly) so often inserted, I durst not be too bold with sacred things. For I well saw those two names iointly considered, are now growne of such estimation, as all Nations & Kings bend their knees, & doff their bonnets at the naming of them, more superstitiously for destroying, thā reuerently at the Name of Iesus for sauing. Therefore I could not resolue, whether it were treason or sacriledge, or I wot not what greater sin, to touch sacred things profanely with common and vnwasht hands; especially when I saw all such as had done the like, or lesse then thus, made miserable ex∣amples of disobedience, as if they had offended Adam him∣selfe, or a house miraculously raised vp by God, or rather o∣riginally created in nature, to rule ouer all the world in Adams stead; and that to be the son of a King, could not protect an offendor in this kind from punishment, yea, from being cast out of his paradise. O (thought I) when I saw this, how worthy is he, that doth thus to be counted only the Ca∣tholique King: for he is a King of Kings indeed, fit to be the executioner of his Holinesse diuine Decrees, and to con∣sume all with Lightning, where the sacred fulminations went before. Tremble all Princes, and looke to your Crownes; especially you petty ones in Germany, that are but fatted to be swallowed one after another, as his stomack can digest, or your turne comes to be serued vp. You see it is safer being his seruant, than the sonne of any Potentate besides. Therefore striue for place and preferment there, and helpe with all the speed yee may, to betray one another to ruine. Your that are Protestants or Lutherans, it is no mat∣ter for Religion; hold some the stirrop, and let others lift Spaine into the saddle, to ride one another like Poste-horses by turnes. You see how honourably he deales with that Prince, whose peaceable patents made him easie entrance; and how fauourably with the Palätinate, whom he rides in bloud, and spur-galls on both sides, whilst you stand laugh∣ing on, and see not that your day is comming. Thus I thought, and thought withall to be silent, and to keep these papers from flying abroad, for feare of hauing my owne wings clipt. But when I saw in defect of greater, God had raised vp petty Princes to defend the Faith, and put that spirit into the Prince of Orange, the Count Mansfelt, and the Duke of Brunswicke, which he had taken from Saxo∣nie and Bavaria, and others, it made me resume courage, be∣holding the immediate hand of God in this worke, and to thinke, surely God will haue all the glory to himselfe, that he imployes such instruments, whose estates, in comparison, are but drops to the Spanish Ocean: I will not therefore be guilty of so much cowardise, as to reserue my selfe, where these men fight, and seeme prodigall of their owne liues; or at least, not of so much dishonestie, as to conceale what God hath sent into my hands, perhaps to publish for the generall informa∣tion and benefit of all Christendome. Goe out therefore, and prosper in Gods name. THE NEW-FOVND POLITCKE. THE THIRD PART. CHAP. 1. After an exquisite Examination and triall made of those Wits, which ought to haue the charge of Prouinciall Gouernments, a ranke of Go∣uernors are published in Parnassus, and whole∣some auisoes for all Gouernors, Iudges, and vnder-Officers of State. A Fter a long time spent in expectation, ye∣sterday, finally to the satisfaction of all men, the Distribution of this States go∣uernment was published. It is not pos∣sible to beleeue the diligence and exqui∣site circumspections, which were taken by his Maiestie and his Ministers in the choise of those be∣ing exact and worthy of so great a businesse. For first, they tooke into their consideration to make choise of ancient men, experimented in State affaires, onely to the end, that Colts should not be put to be tamed by knauish house brea∣kers; and it is worth the obseruation, that in so great a num∣ber of concurrents for places, they had elected persons of a slow Genius, of cold constitutions, and in their actions per∣plext, irresolute, and addicted to drowsinesse, euen almost to disability: and on the contrary, that they had excluded those which for the quicknesse and viuacity of their wits, appea∣red to be far fitter, and more worthy of employments than others. And it is thought the reason was, because that wise men, which are promoted to businesses of examinations and trialls of wits doe firmely beleeue, that those wits which are ouer liuely, nimble, & fiery, proue very vnapt to rule others, hauing great need themselues of a curbing-bit, and a head-straine to saue them from falling downe headlong into dit∣ches; it being also manifest by long experience, that these by their foole hardy, and ouer-resolute spirits, doe sooner dis∣quiet people than become good instruments to maintaine them in that sweet peace and correspondent satisfaction, which indeed ought to be the principll care of all those which should be admitted to mannage the affaires of pro∣uinciall Gouernments. And it is apparant to all men, how those Princes Electors hold it for an irrefragable maxime, that, Hee makes a happier progresse with very good suc∣cesse, who being of a slower genius, of a soft spirit, knowes best to accommdate his passions to stand as still as a Signe at a Tauerne; because the world, which requires good go∣uerment, turnes quickly seditious and imbroyled with the phantasticall Chymeraes of certaine hotspurres, which in all their affaires by seeking to become ouerwise in their owne conceit, they doe in stead of quenching and appeasing trou∣bles and combustions, kindle them the more by vnseasona∣ble remedies. Intempestiuis remediis delicta accendunt. Fifteene daies since, by a most rigorous Triall, which was made for so great a businesse, not the ignorant (as many thought) but those capricious Proiectours were excluded, whose pates being full of or others and new inuentions, are enemies to those ancient customes and ingenuous orders, whereto people haue beene enured as another nature, yet these subtle heads would better them with moderne and new lawes. Tis true, they greatly laboured to finde out pliable subiects of a milde and flexible disposition, which knew to apply their owne nature to another bodies nature conformable, as wiues ought to be to their husbands. Nor did they admit at any hand an Officer, which had not studi∣ed for the space of foure years continually, that most impor∣tant point of Philosophy, to liue as not to liue: The very Basis and ground-worke, whereon the quietnesse of people securely consisted, and the safety also of that good gouernment, which might be hoped at the hands of an ho∣nest wise Gouernour, in whom they did not so much re∣gard his insight and knowledge in the Lawes and Statutes, as that he should be well seene in that prudent mystery, in that mild manner of proceeding, and in that dexterity of vn∣derstanding, as is not as yet found registred in Bookes. A consideration so necessary, that some great Lawyers, which haue had the charge of Prouinces, lighted vpon most sim∣ple successe, as that lanthorne of the Lawes Bartolus can beare testimony, who was forced to leape out of a window at the Palace of Todi, for all his rare iudgement and skill in the Lawes because he would not be taken and torne in pie∣ces by some that could no longer brooke the impertinent cu∣riosities of one that was so wise of his tongue, and so impru∣dent in his braine. Likewise this is certaine, that they re∣iected, euen with the bastinado, those great Beasts, which with open ostentation, to Peacocke-wise vsed to looke big with austere & terrible countena ce, taking delight to threa∣ten his Maiesties Subiects, made by the Creatour of the same mould as themselues, more like tyrants, than ciuill Iud∣ges, which many of them counterfeit for some other sinister respect, and aboue all things they had a care to exclude those tyrannicall Butchers, who Busyris like, being bent to shed humane blood, would make men beleeue, that they went a∣bout to set the crooked World right againe with Pillories, with Gibbets,, or at least with stupendious ines and mulcts worse than a Thunder-bolt, such as were neuer imposed in more ancient times. Aboue measure they loued those Iud∣ges which tooke more care to hinder misdemeanours, than to punish them, and which neuer subscribe to the sen∣tence of Death, the Greeke letter Θ, without the Inke of Teares. The next day after, all the Presidents and Iudges appea∣red before Apollo, who caused Salust Crispus, chiefe Nota∣ry of the Collaterals, to minister the oath vnto them, which was, That they should faithfully leaue the world as they found it, and not alter any of the ancient Priuiledges. After the Oath thus ministred, the said Salust tooke aside the Gouernour of Libethrum, a Fauorite of his, and gaue him these admonitions. First, to begin his Gouernment with a kinde of carelesnesse, and to continue it with dili∣gence by degrees, entring in as a Lambe, and playing the Lyon towards the end, but alwaies generously inclined, remembring that Principle of Cornelius Tacitus, Acribus initiis incurioso fi e. Secondly, that in all causes betweene the Common peo∣ple he should doe most exact Iustice without exception of persons: but in suits arising among the Nobler sort hee should mingle with the rigour of Iustice the dexterity of a wary iudgement, remembring alwayes, that the accusations of great persons were so odious to Princes that they laid vpon Officers Gownes an aspersion, like the tainting spots of corrupted Oile which could neuer bee washt away with the purest sope of innocence. Therefore among those great spirited men, a Iudge had need with the sword of Iustice, to imploy like a wise Fencer, the target of a nimble wit and a cautelous care, that neither of the one side nor of the other, he be exclaimed vpon for any distasteful or∣der. For Princes hauing cause to vse their helpe for coun∣sell, force, or purses, they desire to hold them well satisfied. And therefore in controuersies falling out among them, a Iudge had need to learne some easie way to draw out rotten teeth, and with the hand of dexterity to fill vp the place with the finest Cotten wooll. Thirdly, a Iudge must enforce himselfe to know all things, but not to execute al which he knowes. Omnia scire non omnia exequi. For to attempt needlesse and brabling matters, were to goe about to set straight the leg of a Dog, or to lose his braine in the Alchymie of Fooles. And in this corrupt Age it is good counsel for an Officer to tolerate in people some stale disorder, then with any ill satisfaction to the generalitie to torment himselfe to seeke to bring in that, which he cannot execute without commotions and heart-burnings. Fourthly, that with other Iudges and officers subiect to the same Prince, he should not contend nor contest for mat∣ter of preheminence or right, nor looke to be his owne Car∣uer, or to right himselfe in his Court by vsing any strict course with inferiour officers for matters of prerogatiue of Courts, but either to acquaint the Prince himselfe, or to winke at the affront, if another Court seemes to iustifie the subiect, or els to take in hand the weapons of a gowned man, the pen. But if the Iudges authoritie stretch to the Confines of another Prince, hee must not seeke differences, nor auoid them. But if they proceed from Souldiers or Pyrats, he must defend his Borders and Iurisdiction with Armes. Yet so, that towards all princes subiects in league and amitie with his Prince, he behaue himselfe as temperately regardfull, as zea∣lously affected to his owne Princes honour. Fiftly, that in some occasions he preferre the publicke peace of his gouernment before that strictnesse of Iustice, which is mentioned in Bookes. Sixtly, that for any impertinent thing, which hee sees or heares, which be not extraordinarily altered in mind or countenance; and that if he cannot doe this, yet that he re∣fraine himselfe from speaking of it, and in any case to beware that he deliberate not, nor study for reuenge or reformation in heat or anger, but in cold blood after a long times delay. Seuenthly, that in supreme and waighty matters hee take heed of making any shew of vndaunted, of a fiery, and re∣solued mind, but rather that he content himselfe to hunt Waspes and Hornets out of their holes, with the hand of the Prince armed with the gauntlet of a higher authority; for al∣though an Officer findes that he hath ability and power enough to execute a greater enterprise, yet for feare of emula∣tion in Court, or some casuall blocke in his way, which the wisest man could not foresee, oftentimes it is not expedi∣ent to put in execution all that which his authority might warrant him. Eightly, that he deale in all ordinary matters concerning ordinary men, entring into strict friendship with no man re∣siding within the precincts of his command, but to beware of that wresting and wiredrawing occasions, which might reach vnto the hatred and hindrance of another, and to auoid domesticall familiaritie, which causeth contempt. One∣ly let him vse that decent grauity which may procure respect and an awfull loue. But in any case, that he shunne the con∣uersation of base and riotous persons, and that he keepe com∣pany for the most with men of his owne ranke, yet so, that he make not any man so endeared and so bosome a friend vnto him, who might afterwards by prying into his dea∣lings, and diuing into his secrets, turne to be his capitall ene∣my. For sometimes contemptible persons, not suspected for craft, may in the twinkling of an eye, of low and earth cree∣ping mushromes, become tall Cedars at least in their owne ouerwe ning conceit. Ninthly, that he force his noble nature to endure the stin∣king pride of Lawyers, although most odious to God and all good men, and to beare with their impertinent discourses, and wrangling bawling, who take vpon them to become Lambes at home and Lyons abroad, onely to maintaine the glory and reputation of the Bench, but commonly it is to fill their owne purses with the ruines and spoyles of honester men than themselues. Wherein I wish him to remember that golden saying of Tacitus, that it is a most profitable, as al∣so most pithy in the choise and free will of Good and Euill things to consider, what thou thy selfe wouldest or wouldest not endure vnder another Gouernour or Iudges power, Vti∣lissimus idem, ac r uissimus bonarum malarum{que} rerum dele∣ctus, cogitare, quid volueris sub alio Principe, aut nolueris. Tenth, that he take heed with great circumspection he fall not into the other extremity in seeking to auoid the defect of his predecessor, as a certaine Prince very heedlesly did, who perceiuing that wise men fou d fault with the late Prince for too much lenity, turned an odious Tyrant. The golden Meane is euer best. Eleuenth, that with extraordinary seuerity he take more care to bridle the disorders of his own house, then the sediti∣ons of the common people; for the immodest and vnciuill carriage of a Magistrates domesticke gentlemen, whom some call Countrey-Courtiers, is a farre greater blemish and scan∣dall to their Master, then the brutish insolence of rude Clownes and ill-bred Swaines. Twelth, that he hate, as the horrour of Hell, all kind of fore-stalling and engrossing of commodities, and that he ac∣count as the Capitall enemy of his reputation such detesta∣ble gaines. But specially, that diuelish gaine, which is in these dayes much practised, and one of the chiefe causes of our Creators anger towards many States, by the sale of Offices. A most perillous Charybdis, a rocke so dangerous in the Sea of worldly businesse, that Iustice being fled backe into Hea∣uen, these petty Chapmen, who neuer dreame of another world but this earthly one, turne all things topsie turuy to make themselues sauers for their dear-bought places. Where∣as a noble spirit should firmely beleeue, that the Merchandise of a Christian is ingenuous simplicity and plain dealing, and being honestly called to beare office in his countrey, then his richest lucre worthy of an honourable Officer is to ingulfe himselfe in the Trade of honour and vprightnesse of Iustice, which being by the trumpet of Fame blowne into his Prin∣ces eares in a short time, God inspiring the heart of the Prince, he shall be preferred from Office to Office, vntill hee arriue to a contented fortune correspondent to his Heroycall worth and magnanimous minde. Thirteenth, that perpetually he haue his eyes fix on his vnder-Iudges hands, and that he looke as narrowly to them, as if he held a biting serpent in his owne hand, that iniustice being a very dangerous member which hazards his credit by the Diuels temptations to blurre his masters honour by playing the base Mechanicke in the sacred seat of Iustice. And because no Iudge receiues bribes but sinisterly by his wise, seruant, or without witnesse, sauing the party himselfe, his supreme Iudge or Prince ought to proclaime rewards to the discouerers, and vpon the least euidence to remoue such theeues of the Deity; seeing that Iustice is one of the prime Diuine Attributes. Fourteenth, that he accommodate his Genius & Nature to the nature of his prouincials, shewing himselfe mild to the peaceable, and seuere to the seditious. And to take speciall care to weed out idle persons; if they refuse conuenient labor, which he ought to see them put vnto; and if any Drones be found with honey, to examine them from whose hiue they stole the same. Fifteenth, that to the end his Prince may conceiue well of his worth, he acquaint not his highnesse with slight occur∣rences, nor trifling matters, which fall out in his gouern∣ment. Nor yet must he refraine to certifie vnto him all the most important affaires, chiefly, all proiects tending to his honour or profit. Sixteenth, that he beleeue how the penalties and punish∣ments in the power of a wary Iudge, consists more in threats then in inflicting of them, & that he neuer forget this lesson: How Officers gouerne men full of a thousand imperfecti∣ons, subiect to infinite errours, how they are not Angells of Heauen which cannot sinne; and therefore in his gouern∣ment hee affects more the report of a sweet natured Iudge, like his Creatour, who bearing with our trespasses, Si quoties peecant homines, toties sua fulmina mittat, and not the repute of a tyrannizing Minister. Seuenteenth, that he frequent not Reuels, Dances, or any publike Feasts, mournfull spectacles, and tragicall in the end to wise Officers, as instruments, which vilifie his fame, and bring his personall presence into contempt among the vul∣gar, and might bring his grauitie into question among his equals. Eighteenth, that he know how the shamefull acts of the Nobles and principall Gentlemen doe waxe more cruell against them, which debase themseues to commit them, without touching or blemishing the generall reputes of their honourable families. Ninteenth, that he held it for a thing certaine, that it is better to dissemble and winke at some common infirmities and frailties, then to shew himselfe earnest to punish them, it not being the resolution of a wary man to enter into that naughty passage, out of the which he otherwise knowes, that the horse cannot draw forth his feet. Twentieth, that he vary not in opinion with his equals in office or vnder Officers, but vpon extremitie, knowing that his Prince had rather he should vse dexteritie and nim∣blenesse of wit in such actions, then rigorous Iustice. Twenty one, that with a pleasing sagacity he let the world see, how he had found all such as inhabite in his iurisdiction rather good people, then by any rigorous proceedings of his that he made them good, because whosoeuer glories and vaunts that he hath hanged and punished so many malefactors during the time of his office, he triumphs in their infamy and shame, which cannot redound to his honour, nor to that discreet carriage, which is required in a well foreseene Gouernour. CHAP. 2. The most Illustrious Monarchies resident at Par∣nassus, demand by what meanes the Venetian Lady got such exact obedience and exquisite secrecie of her Nobility, whereof shee giues them couenient satisfaction. THe Monarchies of Great Britaine, Prance, Spaine and Polonia, wondring that the Venetians had gotten the start and fame for their gift of Secrecie, and that the Spanish Monarchy could by no cunning intelligences, nor rich pensions corrupt any of their Parliament house, called the Pregadi, neuer as yet to disclose any of their priuy coūcel, they went with one consent to the Palace of the Venetian Lady, earnestly importuning her to discouer vnto them by what meanes or pollicie of State she had arriued to that hap∣pinesse, as to obtaine such Secrecie and rare Obedience in so many mouthes and hearts, which they could scarce meet withall in one or two of their trustiest seruants. To this the Lady answered, that she had allured and wonne her Nobility to this vertue of Secrecie, with rewards and hopes of promo∣tion, and for the crime of disobedience she scared them with punishment. To which the aboue-named Monarchies replied, that they also wrought and vsed the same meanes, but could ne∣uer as yet obtaine that wonderfull effect and rare end. Then said the Lady that hapned, because in comparison of those ewards, which are conferred vpon well-deseruing persons in a Common-wealth rightly ordered, the rewards of Mo∣narchies were poore, and punishments more sparing. Where∣to the Monarchies made answer, that with them it was cleane contrary, and that the rewards of Free-States, to bee paraleld with the wastfull liberalitie, which great Kings extended towards their Ministers, was but beggery. For they neuer heard, the Venetians had beene so liberall as to re∣compence any of their Senators seruice and fidelity with pre∣ferring them to be owners of Cities, Townes, Castles, Lieu∣tenantships, or Lands in Fee, as Kings haue diuers times ad∣uanced their Subiects vnto: And that the greatest reward, which the Venetians accustomed to bestow at any time vpon their Senators, was to prefer them to some Offices, which they were forced to labour hard for, and to passe many base and inferiour Offices by degrees and steps, euen from their youth vp, before they could arriue to any supreme place of command or profit. Besides that, the most part of their Offices were rather hindrances than gainfull: onely they caried a colour of some reputation to them that knew no better, nor saw the glory and pomps of Monarchies. And for punishments, without any comparisons, those were far more terrible and cruell, which proceeded from the resolued will of a Prince incensed for some grieuous cause, than the punishments of the Venetian Senate against any of their Senators, which ordinarily were more slow and warie, than sudden and quicke. And that there was a great diffe∣rence in proportion betweene a Prince, which iudged his v ssall, and a Senator which by his suffrage and voice puni∣shed his equall, his friend, and kinsman: That the Veneti∣ans knew not but banishment, and one kind of cruell pu∣nishment, called, Iltremendo Canal Orfano, to sowe vp their Traitors in a Sack, and to drowne them in their Lake, which they seldome doe but in desperate cases: Whereas in Mo∣narchies, the Iudges sentenced some to be hang'd, drawne, and quartered, some to be burnt, some to be rackt and tor∣tured, a thing common in Spaine, practised vnder pretext of heresie towards other Princes sub ects; and if any of their Nobilitie were condemned for high Treason, they escaped not the axe, the kindest fauour England affords to offendors, sauing one only example in the Chronicles, of Queene Anne Bullen, for her greater grace and honour was beheaded with the sword of Calice. At these speeches the Venetian Dame smiled, and said, that in stead of those rewards of Honour and Estates in Fee, which Monarchs bestowed vpon their well-deseruing Creatures, shee also requited her best and wisest Nobles with places of great authority and command, with most absolute power and dominion; One with the Noble Kingdome of Creet or Candy; others with Corfu, and other Ilands subiect to her State: Some shee preferred to be her Viceroyes in Dalmatia and Istria; some shee appointed Gouernours of her neighbouring Territories on the Continent, of Nova Palma, Forum Iulij, Harca Trevisano, Padua, Vincenza, Ve∣rona, Brescia, Bergamo, Crema on the Frontiers of Milan, and the rest of her Nobilitie shee reserued perhaps to their far greater contentment in the Senate-house at home in Ve∣nice, which might be termed the Maiesticall Miracle of Cities. So that her Nobles might better be called Kings and great Princes, than priuate Gentlemen or Subiects, who in all affaires of moment, hauing euery one a speciall interest, must needs be faithfull to their owne selues; whereas the seruants of Princes were faithfull vnto them not as sons but as vassals. And the feare, which frights our Nobles of Ve∣nice from selling the Secrets of the State, to forraigne Princes ariseth from this infinite disparity and disproportion, that is betwixt that which is lost with treachery, and that which is gained with fidelitie; betwixt that remorse of conscience, which a Subiect feeles for betraying his Prince, and the feare which a Senator is possessed with for prouing disloy∣all to a Free-State. There is great difference in the loue of a Free-borne Senator, and the loue of a cringing vassall, howso∣euer he be gilded with the bare title of a Nobleman. What will it then boot one of our Senators to bewray the secrets of our State to his owne hindrance and perpetuall disho∣nour? Finally, the Venetian Dame told them, that the re∣wards which Princes conferred vpon their Counsellors and Secretaries, occasioned oftentimes pernitious effects cleane contrary to their Masters meaning which trusted them; because those rewards so giuen not onely cooled them in their good seruice, specially at that time, when they had no more, than they might hope for of him for their cares and paines: but the good will of the Prince being commonly mutable, and subiect to change and nouelty, the treacherous machinations and emulations of some Courtiers being fre∣quent and rife, it sometimes falls out that the Ministers to assure themselues of their places and high commands, which they purchased by their honourable deserts, or perhaps by the helpe of their purses, or by other meanes, suspecting a remouall from their Offices, or some disasters by their ad∣uersaries, they proue vnderhand false, and to make vp their market, or perhaps to make themselues sauers; if they bought their places, they fell their Princes secrets, and may be af∣terwards tempted to doe him a worse mischiefe. But such is the ardent affection, which kindles in the hearts of all our Venetian Nobles, that they will hazard to liue with po∣uerty, shame, and disdaine at home, than to be hired abroad by strange Princes, or to betray their natiue Country by reuea∣ling any secrets which might redound to the common hin∣derance: so that I may rightly liken a Nobleman of Venice to a Fish, which being bred in that Lake in the water of li∣berty, knowes not how to liue abroad out of Venice in the element of seruitude. CHAP. 3. The Romane Monarchy demanding of Corne∣lius Tacitus the resolution of a Politicall Que∣stion, receiues full satisfaction of the Shep∣heard Meliboeus, who casually was there pre∣sent. THE ancient Romane Monarchy euer since shee was ransackt by the Gothes, Vandalls, and other Northerne Barbarians, liued neere this Court vnder colour of going a hunting continually disguised for the same pur∣pose the other day repaired to Cornelius Tacitus, who for his recreation had retired himselfe out of Parnassus into the Country. To whom shee said, that she came vnto him pur∣posely to be resolued of one maine doubt, which troubled her minde continually, the which she had imparted to ma∣ny Politicians, but could neuer as yet be satisfied by any of them, and therefore she repaired to him, as to the prime and grand Statesman of all others. The matter which thus perplexed her was to know why the Kingdomes of Greece, Asia, Egypt, France, Britaine, Spaine, and the Common-wealth of Carthage, with many other great Prouinces, before they became vnited to the State of Rome, were of themselues power∣full-enough and formidable, but being sithence subiected and vnited together in her proper person, they missed with all their forces to make her strong and durable. To this Cornelius Tacitus answered, that this was a difficult Question, and could not suddenly be resolued, but the next day after some pause and studie he would returne thither with his best reso∣lution. The Monarchesse rested very well satisfied, and as shee was ready to licence his departure, Meliboeus that fa∣mous Shepherd recorded by the Poets, who that morning had brought to Tacitus a present of fresh cheese and creame, and a couple of dainty cheeses, and stood all the while at∣tentiuely listning to this Question, seeing them now ready to take their leaue, he interrupted them, desiring Tacitus not to depart, for he would instantly without any study giue the Lady sufficient satisfaction. The Lady and Tacitus laughed very heartily, and bade him not to beat his braine about such deepe matters, but to goe home and looke to his sheepe. Meliboeus replied very earnestly, that no Race a∣mong mortall men could better discourse of true and solid State-businesse than Shepherds; and that Princes should be most happy, if in gouerning their Subiects, they could imitate Shepherds in charity: And so should the people bee, if they could obey their Prince, as sheepe did their shepherd. The Monarchesse and Tacitus confounded with maruell at the sudden and extemporary words of the Shepherd, wil∣led him freely to vtter his resolution. Whereupon Meli oeus began in this manner: Most mighty Princesse, I am (as my Virgil well knowes) his Mantuan Shepherd, and it were a great shame to these siluer haires, which you see on my head and chin, if I were not exactly experienced in my owne occupation; I say then, that in so many yeares which I haue spent in gouerning sheepe, I haue gotten this knowledge, that the greatnesse and power of a Shepherd doth not con∣sist (as many ambitious and conetous men beleeue) in pos∣sessing of thousands of sheepe, but that he be owner of so many sheepe onely, as a good Shepherd can watch with his eye, gouerne with his rod, and rule with his whistle. And the reason is cleare, for in too small a number of sheepe we see Shepherds poore, because their great pouerty compels them with too much seuerity to milk their flock, and too of∣ten to sheare them. In a moderate and meane number, where the true perfection lies, Shepherds become alwaies wealthy and happy; whereas in the excesse and ouer-abounding number of sheepe, by reason of the difficult and hard means to gouerne them, being thus from the golden rule of pro∣portion so far remote, and indeed beyond the power of one man, they cannot chuse but incur manifest danger. Whence it comes to passe, that the miserable sheep of his flock being too many in number, by the couetousnesse and carelesnesse of him, that vndertakes to gouerne them, doe pine away at first, and at last they dye of meere necessitie and want. How is it possible, but that confusion should happen, where mul∣titudes abound out of the Owners view and reaches: For it is the Masters owne eye, which fattens and makes his flocke to thriue. Right happy were many great Potentates and States, if our Creator had bestowed on them the propertie of Camells to bow and kneele downe to the ground for the receiuing of the burthen of Gouernments, and had the dis∣creet moderation to set meeres and bounds vnto their ambi∣tious minds by rising and standing vp (as is the manner of those beasts ) when they feele themselues reasonably well laden; and to receiue no heauier charge on their shoulders, though stronger than Atals, at such time as they know them∣selues sufficiently charged with states proportioned accor∣ding to their abilities in true wisdome and prudence. There are past now 1626. yeares, since I became a Shep∣heard in Arcadia, and euer since my comming and being here, I haue contented my selfe with fiue hundred sheepe in my flocke, which haue yearly yeelded mee fiue hundred Crownes, which is more than sufficient for my owne main∣tenance, and my families. And this most fortunate gaine is so sure vnto me, that I am respected of all men in Arcadia, and reputed for the best Shepherd in all the Country. Yea, the wisest in Parnassus doe hold me to be a happier man than Alexander the Great, who was not ashamed to wish for more worlds to conquer. That Shepheard, whose ambition prouokes him to keep many flocks in hope of gaine is much deceiued, for where his owne eye cannot ouersee, he must needs commit the charge of them to others, commonly, to Louts, Knaues, Theeues, and Villaines, who as people borne altogether for their bellies, and other carnall and worldly pleasures, will not only sheare but slay their Masters flocks. Besides, who knowes not whether he must sometime or other vndergoe a greater charge than all his Flocks amount vnto in warlike prouisions and garrisons to defend them from Pirates and wilde Tartars, or from his malicious neighbours? For example, I will instance in my neighbour Menalcas, who being my capitall enemy, and bearing great enuy and emulation in seeing me prosper with my fiue hundred sheep aboue him and others, and verily beleeuing, that he should supplant me, if he could enioy more flocks than I kept, not content with the like number of sheepe as he formerly possessed equall vnto mee, but thinking to make himselfe absolute Monarch of all other Pastors in Arcadia, he tooke vp money at vse, and at the extremest interest, sold the grea∣test part of his Patrimonie, and hauing got together a large masse of money, sent into England, Spaine, and to strange Countries, where he vnderstood the fairest wolled sheep were, and with excessiue cost transported them hi∣ther, and made three seuerall flocks of fiue hundred in each flocke. But it fortuned so, that those sheepe being forraine, and not acquainted with the language and whistles of our Shepheards, nor with our kinde of pasture, they stragled here and there into vnknowne places. Whereupon Me∣nalcas was forced to substitute Deputy Shepheards and many Dogs to looke vnto them and to fetch them in. But such was the naturall hatreed of the sheepe towards the Dogs, and the implacable moodinesse which they concei∣ued to be continually hurried vp and downe, that they fell into an inward conceit of languor and despair, and so into flat disobedience to abhorre both their Shepheards and the Dogs, insomuch that when they were to bee milkt and shorne, they hid themselues in woods and deserts. And then it was known throughout all Arcadia▪ that Despaire and strange vsage can turne Conies into Lions. Yea, it was sound, that at that time the Spanish sheepe, which Menalcas had brought thither, proued so rauing mad, that they attemp∣to bite their Shepheards. Menalcas thus perplexed for the losse and escape of so many sheepe, hired out of Spaine and Swizzerland, the valiantest Dogs hee could haue for money, which considering the infinite charge he sustained in conducting them into Arcadia, and the nature of these Dogs being continually accustomed to hunt these sheepe, they came at last, what for want of their due allowance, and what of a wanton and greedy disposition, they turned like Wolues, and preyed so long vpon these silly sheep, that the rest which were left aliue pined away with griefe, rather to endure such continual hurrying and troubles vnder strange Pastors and rauenous Dogs. Poore Menalcas vpon the report of this tragicall euent became the by-word and subiect of laughter to all Arcadia for this his ambitious enterprise; and was pointed at with the more fingers, euen of very boyes, when afterwards he was faine to turne a petty merchant of skins, the vnlucky relicks of a lamentable charge, and the presaging tokens of his owne Funerals; for indeed the mans heart-strings brake of very sorrow and melancholy, leauing his house, that sometimes flourished among the best of vs in Arcadia, now desolate and most miserable. CHAP. 4. Many people hauing wasted their meanes by glut∣tonous feasts, prodigall fare, and pompous appa∣rell, for the moderating of such lauish expences doe desire a Statute of their Princes, but they misse of their purpose. SOme Nations subiects to certaine Princes which are resident here at Parnassus, hauing tryed, that super∣fluity of belly-cheere, excesse of drinking, and the va∣nities of apparell and new-fangled fashions, are now a dayes besides the wrath of their Creatour iustly incurred for the breach of these vowes, which were vndertaken for them at their Baptisme, many men were transformed into Swinish qualities, to their healths impaire, the ruine of their estates, and soules danger. And for their outside, they garnished themselues like peacocks, so gay and trimme, that no patri∣mony how rich soeuer, can now supply the ambition of men, nor the vanities of women; & that they also obseruing in these proud times, how this excesse proceeds yet further, that all the portion which is left vnto young Gentlewomen, whom ciuill modesty heretofore was wont to be their chie∣fest ornament, how great soeuer the same might be, did not now suffice to buy them Carkanets and Iewels, and imbro∣dered peticotes, so that Fathers are not able to marry them according to their rancke; and to match them with thrifty persons were almost impossible, for hauing knowne them for such vaine creatures, they will not be troubled with their company, and to let them runne headlong according to their vnbridled fancies, they must either marry with vnthrifts, like themselues, or liue vnmarried, to the hazard of their chasti∣ties: so that except some Law be enacted for the curbing of this excesse, they may well be said to hold the Wolfe by the eares. Vpon these considerations, fearing their vtter ouerthrow, with one consent they presented their supplications to their Princes, who seemed very glad to entertaine their motion so much tending to the publike good, and like good Polititi∣ans knowing how profitable it is to strike the iron while it is hot, & at that time to publish a Law, when the subiects them∣selues become sutors for it, must needs fall out very luckily, & with good fruit in the effect, they out of hād, while their sub∣iects were in this humour of thirft, ioyned together to cut off all superfluous customes in feasts and drinkings, and all new fashions of attires, tying themselues to one fashion onely, not to be altered for many yeares, allowing what is decent and comely to euery seuerall vocation. But the Euening before this most laudable Statute was to be signed and published, accidentally it came to the eares of the Princes, Farmers, and Officers of the Customes and Im∣posts, who being likewise backt and whetted on by the Mer∣cers, Vintners, Grocers and other Tradesmen which liued vpon the spoile of the richer sort, they repaired in all haste to their Princes, and very cunningly intreated to defaulke and abate a great part of those yearely summes which they were to pay them for such Wines, Spice, Sugars, and such other forraine commodities, as by way of Customes and Imposts, they were to receiue to their vse. The Princes stood confoun∣ded in their iudgement, hearing speech of so great losses and defalkments, as they very craftily insinuated and pretended in Foxes habits to be most true, and although most of the stuffes were wrought in their owne Countries, at least the most durable and best befitting euery Nation, yet they made their Princes beleeue, that there came from Naples, from Ge∣noa, from Millan, and from Spaine, so many kinds of stuffes, silkes, gold and siluer lace, which if the Statute of thrift went currant, they could not but sustaine exceeding great losses in the publike Customes; whereupon the Princes sent for the Committies and Deputies of their People, and told them what their Customers had proued before them on their ho∣nest words, so that they could not hinder their owne interest and profit, lest they should make themselues leane in going about to fatten them. With this answere sauouring of the Princes gaine, the people departed much grieued and affli∣cted, and confessed all of them, that to heale any disorders with that medicine which might offend the publike Cu∣stomes and Imposts were desperate Cure, and incurable Cankers. CHAP. 5. Terence the Comedian being imprisoned by Ia∣son the Pretour of Vrbine, for keeping a Con∣cubine, is deliuered by Apollo with very great dishonour to the Pretour. PVblius Terentius liued in a little house, but very well furnished, in the Comicall quarter, with no more me∣ni all seruants about him, then Bacchis his maid & Da∣vus his ancient attendant. And although Bacchis in the floure of her age, being then a very beautifull creature, had bin gra∣ced with her Masters bed, yet now being aged, she continued in his house without scandall, and very modestly disposed, not ministring the least cause of murmuring or dislike to any of the neighbourhood. But it happened about tenne dayes since, that Iason the great Lawyer being Pretour of Vrbine, to get him some repute in his new Office, directed a Proces vnder a penaltie to Terence, commanding him in his Ma∣iesties name, all excuses laid aside, immediately to put Bacchis out of his house, vnlesse he would incurre the danger of a Concubine-keeper. But Terence did not onely disobey the contents of the Mandate, but other Writs of Iasons court. Whereupon the Pretour forbare to send any more warrants of orders and injunctions; and yesterday without any more adoe caused Terence to be apprehended and imprisoned; but with so great displeasure to Apollo, that in an extraordi∣nary great chafe he publikely exclaimed, that by his officers, yea and that in Parnassus, men more malicious then igno∣rant, that wicked abuse of being quick-sighted in apparance and shew, but blind in matters of substance was lately intro∣duced and practised to the dishonour of his Court. Then commanding Terence to be discharged out of prison, he cau∣sed Iason himselfe, for all his famous Bookes of the Law to be there shut vp in his stead, and also to his greater affliction, appointed Philip Decius his Aduersary, to be Pretour in his roome. Whereupon yesterday the Rod and the Standard, being the Pretorian E signes, were deliuered to Decius, who going to Apoll es presence his Maiestie spake these words vn∣to him: By the correction inflicted on Iason, learne to know that Reuerend Iudges, which in the administration of Iu∣stice, doe more attend the true and reall seruice of God, than by formall trickes and gibes to play vpon their Inferiours, they ought first to hunt out of his owne house malice and bribery, and then to chase out of other mens houses young harlots, as Thai , before hee proceeded to expell an aged Bacchis. CHAP. 6. Domitius Corbulo for certaine words spoken by him during the time of his gouernment, which sauoured of Tyranny, is called in question by the Criminall Magistrates, but in the end to his greater glory dismissed. BEcause the Citie of Pirrhus, and all that most populou Territory by the mildnesse and ouer much lenity of cer∣taine Gouernours, became more insolent then in for∣mer times, and full of Malefactours and perillous Factions, which disturbed the peace of the vertuous, Apolloes Maiestie, to bridle with some exemplary punishment, the licentious∣nesse of his seditious subiects, about two moneths past sent into that gouernment, the rigorous Domitius Corbulo, who in few dayes did so demeane himselfe, that from a seditious State, he reduced the same to a peaceable course of liuing. Within a while after, it chāced, that Corbulo discoursing with some of his familiar friends, enquired of them, what conceit they had of him: they freely answered him, that the rigor and seuerity which he had lately vsed against many of the sediti∣ous, had terrified the whole Citie and Countrey, that all did hate him. At which answer, Corbulo reioyced beyond mea∣sure, and told them againe: Theres no matter, Oderint dum metuant; let them hate, so they stand in feare of me. The which words were afterwards carried by some pick-thanks to Apollo who taking in ill part the accusation, referred the same to his Court of criminall causes. And because by an ancient Decree published by his Maiestie, it was knowne and declared, that whatsoeuer Prince legitimate, naturall, and hereditary, presumed to vtter such arrogant and rash words, he should incurre this penalty, to be reputed a Tyrant, and if any Officer should let slip, though vnawares, and by chance, any such dangerous words out of his mouth, he should be capitally puni∣shed. Corbulo was summoned to appeare vpon this Informa∣tion before the Iudges, who according, came the next day to answere with all humility; where the case was throughly canuased, and while all men expected to heare some rigo∣rous order to be taken with Corbulo, by extraordinary fauour the cause was remoued by a Certiorari before Apollo him∣selfe, where to all mens admiration he was pronounced cleare and guiltlesse, and remaunded backe into his gouern∣ment with far greater authority and grace then before. The sentence contained, that in a Prince which had the Honey of Grace in his power, those words were shamefull, and expresly Tyrannicall; most honourable in that Officers mouth, which had nothing in his hands but the odious sting of Iustice: that Prince being miraculous indeed, which causeth himselfe to be beloued and reuerenced of his people, and that Officer most sufficient which hath the Genius and nature, to make himselfe to be feared and obeyed. CHAP. 7. By the promotion of Diogenes the Cynick, vnto a higher place, the honourable chaire of the Tran∣quillitie of a priuate life being vacant, Apollo preferres the famous Philosopher Crates to that charge, who refuseth it. DIogenes the Cynicke, who for so many yeares with much fruit to the vniuersall good, and his owne infinit glory in particular had vndergone the charge of com∣mending in the Chaire of the publike Schooles Pouerty, Solitarinesse, and that contented quietnesse of mind, by whose perswasion Attalus himselfe the King of Treasure be∣came of that admirable resolution to put away his riches, the easier to embrace the austere Sect of the Stoikes, which is much edified now in Parnassus, about two moneths past he was promoted for his singular great merits to a more sub∣lime Dignitie, euen to be the Archcriticke of the sacred Muses. Whereby the noble Cynicall place left vacant his Maiestie bestowed it on the famous Crates, who yesterday morning went to Apollo, and contrary to all mens expectati∣on refused to accept of this renowned Charge, freely affir∣ming, that by the aduancement of Diogenes to that late tran∣scendent Dignity, the Chaire of pouerty and contentment of mind, being now become vilified and much hindred, his heart would not giue him to exercise that Office with that candour, feruencie, and ingenuous simplicity of mind, as the affaires of that place required: because the very first day, when he should settle himself to his milde Lectures & peace∣able Meditatiōs, of necessity he could not but be swoln with some ambition, and be possessed with the like ardent desire & glorious hope to be enstalled in the same or such another Dignitie, as his Predecessor had obtained, who had cashired & cast out of his hart, though extraordinarily composed, that honest simplicity, which makes wise men to reason, and like a calme wind to breath with their harmlesse thoughts and not with the tongue, which oftentimes trips and deliuers, like a clattering clapper, more noises and gall, then honeyed ad∣monitions. To this he added, that the necessitie of ambition and the violence of desire did arise and flow, not from vice but from that honourable zeale, which also Philosophers, yea, the most mortified of all others in Parnassus, doe hold as the most earnest and intentiue spurre of their Reputation. The reason is, because when they should not receiue in progresse of time, the same or the like preferments at his Maiesties hands, as he had conferred vpon Diogenes, the world would iudge all that came to passe, not by their professed humility, nor because they with all their hearts and soules preferred the priuate life before publike Offices, quietnesse before busi∣nesse, and pouertie before riches: but because his Maiestie had not found in them those abilities, worths and deserts, which he had knowne and found in Diogenes. Therefore Crates foreseeing these inconueniences incident to this Of∣fice, his conscience would not permit him with such a trou∣bled mind, so subiect to the violence of ambition, with any hope of doing good to reade Lectures of humilitie, the con∣tempt of riches, and the vanitie of worldly greatnesse: it be∣ing a thing impossible to find any man so powerfully elo∣quent, which shall be able to perswade others to follow that kinde of life, which the hearers know to be abhorred and misliked of the Preacher himselfe. CHAP. 8. A Controuersie hapning betwixt the Gouernors of Pindus and Libethrum about matters of Iurisdiction: Apollo punisheth them both. IN the Territorie of Libethrum, a hainous misdemeanure being committed, the Gouernour of the place pursued the Offendor, that fled to a Country mans house adioyning to the Territorie of Pindus, and threatned to burne the house, except he yeelded his bodie. In the meane time the Gouernour of Pindus vnderstanding that this place was in his Iurisdiction, hastned also thither. But before his arriuall the Party had submitted himselfe prisoner to the Gouernor of Libethrū: wherupon he of Pindus required the prisoner as his due being taken in his Liberties: but the other claimed the place, where the prisoner was apprehended, to be in his Patent or Commission. After much debating the question and difference, both Gouernours not being able longer to contend in words, fell to blowes, and their men so sided with their Gouernours, that there was much bloudshed on either part. Apollo hearing of these affronts sent for them both, and after long patience in examination of the diffe∣rence, his Maiestie finding that the Gouernour of Libethrum had profferd the first wrong in rashly disturbing the Go∣uernment of his Fellow-subiect, the place appearing now to be clearly in the Gouernment of Pindus, though before somwhat litigious, he depriued him of his Gouernment, and declared him incapable of bearing any charge from thence∣forward. And for the Gouernour of Pindus, whom his Ma∣iestie found to haue most right to the Place and Prisoner, he condemned him for all that to the Gallies for ten yeares, ag∣grauating this execution for example sake, to teach him and all other Officers, that they which serue the one and the same Prince or State, ought to defend the reasons of their Iurisdictions with the Pen, and not with the Pike, reseruing armes and force for strangers, which might inuade their Country. A case remarkable, and to be regarded of all such Officers bearing charge on any Frontier Townes, if not of Iudges of Courts, who though they be subiect to one Prince and the same Lawes, yet for matter of Iurisdiction do some∣times contend, punishing the poore Subiects for their am∣bition and ouersights. CHAP. 9. The Vertuous of Parnassus doe visit the Temple of the Diuine Prouidence, whom they hum∣bly thanke for the great Charitie which his supreme Maiestie from time to time hath vouchsafed to shew vnto Mankind. THis Morning according to the ancient stile of this Court, the Temple of the Diuine Prouidence was visited by all the Scholasticall Princes, and learned Barons of Parnassus. And there Iovianus Pontanus with an excellent praier thanked our great Creator for the infi∣nite charity and loue he hath shewed to Mankind, in crea∣ting Frogs without teeth; because it would haue beene an vnprofitable benefit for Mankind, that this world couered with so many Heauens, full of so many Stars, had beene created the chiefe and soueraigne height of all the most de∣licious pleasures, and not also as abundant of things more necessarie, when Gallants which should spend their time in defending themselues and vs from the bitings of such fasti∣dious and importunate creatures, were like to walke with an insupportable impediment of iron boots: whereas now against such troublesome vermine, which haue no hurt in them sauing their croaking noise, a rampart of a good paire of eares sufficeth, which will not care for that ill-pleasing noise, which they know to be without danger. CHAP. 10. A Contention hapning betweene many Learned men, which might be the most notable Poli∣tick Law, or most excellent Custome worthy of commendation in the flourishing State of Venice, the same is finally decided and deter∣mined by the Venetian State herselfe, to whose arbitrement the Question is referred by their generall consent. VVOrthy of Record is that vertuous Contention, which about six daies past arose betwixt certaine Learned men of this State; who while they dis∣coursed of the notable orders, the most excellent Lawes, and other mostrare Decrees, which maintained the famous Common-wealth of Venice in such height of greatnesse, they fell into sundry opinions, which of them ought to beare away the victory. And because euery one of them did obsti∣nately defend his owne opinion as the best, to the end so great a difference should be decided without commotion of minde or passion, they vnanimously agreed vpon this re∣solution, to appeare all of them before the State herselfe, to whom they should first declare their seuerall reasons, and that shee should afterwards adiudge which of them had ai∣med next vnto the marke. This they made knowne vnto the Soueraigne Lady, who gratiously vndertooke to giue that satisfaction which they expected. Petrus Crinitus then was the first, who said, that it being a most assured rule, that all things whatsoeuer subsist vnder the Moone, doe spring at first and then grow, and waxing old at last they faile: it seemed a thing vnto him worthy of admiration, that the Venetian State alone did notwithstan∣ding her yeares become more youthfull and fresh euery day than other, and that those Lawes, Orders, and Decrees, which in other Principalities after long forbearing of their execution, were at length vtterly forgotten, did only in Ve∣nice so flourish with seueritie, with greater obseruance, and exacter diligence, working that efficacie and benefit, that in this Common-wealth no such reformation, nor innouation euer hapned, as heretofore wee read haue chanced with infinite tumults and hurliburlies in the ancient Romane State, and now of late in the Florentine Common-wealth; it being a peculiar vertue vnto the Venetian Senate, perpe∣tually to preserue their flourishing liberty, with a seuere exe∣cution of their ancient Lawes; whereby none of those de∣faults euer hapned in this State, which other Potentates and Free States could no way shun for all their exquisite care and diligence, but that they fell into such carelesse negligence, that they lost both their liberty and liues. Therefore not without good cause he dared to affirme, as a thing most cer∣taine, that the Venetian Common-wealth for their prudent care in the rigorous execution of their ancient Lawes ought to continue and prosper eternally, as long as the world lasteth. Next spake Angelus Politianus, that he did truly admire both what Petrus Crintus had recounted, and a thousand other orders in that most prudent Common-wealth. But the rarest thing which he obserued, was how an Aristocra∣cie, the true foundation whereof, as the most vnderstanding Writers haue deliuered, was the equalitie of fortunes among the Nobilitie, could haue beene able to maintaine it selfe in such peace and greatnesse, consisting in that disproportioned inequality of wealth, wherewith the Venetian Nobilitie is endowed, wherein although there were two such dangerous extremes found, as immoderate riches with some of them, and much pouertie with others of the same ranke in Venice, notwithstanding there appeared not that defect, which in humane probability and according to the common course of the world, the best Lawes could not prohibite, that the richer sort did not trample the pooror vnder their feet, who though they greatly enuied the condition and state of the wealthy, yet notwithstanding either by reason of their affe∣ctionate charity, which reigned in the Venetian Nobilitie towards the publike good, or else because those infinite riches, which some of them so possessed, were not abused to∣wards their Inferiours; both poore and rich liued mo∣destly, peaceably, and contented in this most Fortunate Countrey. After him followed Iulius Caesar Scaliger, and said, that the greatest wonder in the Venetian State, which amazed the world, was that the Nobilitie themselues which bare sway, did not onely most patiently pay the vsuall ancient subsidies and tallages belonging to the Exchequer, but with incredible alacritie of minde and speedy performance, they assessed on themselues other new impositions of money, which with great diligence and rigour were afterwards ex∣acted and called for at the publike Receiuers hands. Yea and oftentimes in important affaires concerning the Com∣mon-wealth, before they burthened the common people with any new Customes and Taxations, they haue yeelded supplies out of their owne purses, and that so liberally and cheerfully, that this one act of theirs deserued place before all other wonders and remarkable orders in this State, as such a one, which euery man must acknowledge to be an act of that excellent quality, which renders the Venetian Com∣mon-wealth for euer glorious; for hauing such a Nobilitie so dearely inamoured of their Free-State, that they more readily preferred the publike interest before their owne pri∣uate particular. Then succeeded Bernardo Tasso, and said, that he had for a long time soiourned in Venice, where he maruelled at nothing more than to see the Nobilitie, who glutted their mindes with continuall pleasures, delights, and idlenesse, gouerning the affaires of the Republike with such admired vertue, that they seemed vnto others to be men of an exem∣plarie and regular life, and also Rulers borne to perpetuall cares and burthens. After the opinion of Tasso, Francis Berni, according to his manner, with a pleasing grace, which gaue good con∣tent to the most Excellent Venetian Lady, said, that the most rare and wonderfull thing, which great wits ought to admire in this State, that notwithstanding the marshes and chanels did abound with crabs and creuices in all places about the Citie, the Venetian Senators tooke so few of them, that of all other Nations they were reputed, and that iustly, to be the Salt of the Earth. Next vnto him, said Sabellicus, that while he wrote the Venetian Historie, hauing most diligently obserued the no∣tablest Lawes and Customes of this renowned State, hee wondred at nothing more, than at the Publike Treasure, which carefull Senators managed with so great fidelitie, that among the Nobilitie it was held not only a capitall ex∣cesse, but exceeding great infamy to defile their hands with one penny of their Patron S. Marks Treasurie. After him spake Sannazzarius, that the strangest thing vnto him was, that seeing there were many among the No∣blemen of Venice poore and ill prouided of the Goods of Fortune, yet neuerthelesse they endured with vnspeakable patience all their miseries and crosse fortunes, without ha∣uing the least thought of affecting any of the publike goods to be gotten either by ingrossing of corne, or by some vn∣equall diuision of lands, matters which mightily perplexed the State of Rome. And that it seemed vnto him a thing worthy of commendation to see a poore Nobleman in Ve∣nice so striue and force himselfe only by the helpe of Vertue to comfort himselfe in his miseries, hoping in time to de∣serue some honourable and profitable place of imployment in his Country, whereby at last it chanceth, that the vertue, valour, and bountie of the minde doe serue an impouerished Nobleman of this State in stead of a wealthy Patrimony. Iouianus Pontanus said, that they which passed were great maruels, but in his opinion this surpassed all things in the Venetian State, that the huge estates and infinite wealth of some Noble persons wrought not those pernitious effects to puffe them vp with vaine-glory and pride, as haue beene noted in many other Common-wealthes. And that it was a most laudable custome to see these Rich Senatours possessing Princely Treasures liue very priuately at home, and to shew themselues abroad little differing from ordinary people. Whereby all men may conceiue, that the Venetians onely doe know the true way and meane to distinguish and seuer from great riches those inconueniences of Ambition, Pride, and Popularity, which the famous Romane State neuer knew, or could not hinder in Pompey, Caesar, and many other power∣full Senatours. Assoone as Pontanus had ended his discourse, Hannibal Ca∣ro said, that aboue all other wonders he thought it a matter worthy of greatest admiration, to obserue the quality of the Duke of Venice, followed with obedience and reuerence, with Regall Authoritie, with a great command: And for all that to see his Royalty and Princely sway moderated with a set Rule, and the power of his will ioyned with modestie were tempers vnknowne to the prudent Lawgiuers of anci∣ent times, and a kind of wisedome luckily practised among the Venetians. Bartholomew Caualcanti, after him told his opinion, that as Pontanus had intimated, it was strange indeed, that their Senatours wealth and great Estates did not cause some of them to be puft with ambition: But it was a more strange thing to see that such were the Orders of this Famous State, such the sacred Lawes of this euerlasting Common-wealth, that the high places and supreme gouernments, which some of their Senators inioyed as presidents in remoter Coun∣tries subiect vnto their Dominion, did not sometime or other pricke them with ambition to rebell and vsurpe. And at that time when he lay there at Venice, he wondred not at the great Treasure of Saint Marke, nor at the Arcenall, nor at the Grand Canal, with the proud Palaces of the Cornaria, the Grimani, the Foscari, and other magnificent edifices built with such Royall expences in this renowned City being mi∣raculous things in the sight of ordinary persons. But farre more miraculous in his conceit was, that he saw the Noble Signior Sebastian Venieri, a little after he had returned to Ve∣nice from that memorable victory at Sea, which hee had gotten being Generall against the Turkes, liue retired at his priuate house, and when hee walked abroad to the market place, hee differed in nothing from these Senators, who had stayed behind at Venice, but went very plaine and simple in apparell. And surely it is a most singular Custome, which they haue, that their Nobilitie can vse that ciuility and modestie in their owne Citie, and being employed abroad in matters of import and of high command, that they can so∣dainly transforme themselues into most costly garments, with such magnificence, and Princely liberality, to let the world know them for no Citizens of an ordinary State, but for men borne for great enterprizes and for bra e Comman∣ders, as if they were subiects descended from Royall bloud; and also to make themselues famous vnto all other Nations by thus accommodating their affections and spirits to the nature of the place, and framing themselues as well to mo∣desty, ciuilitie, and thrift at home, as to pompuous authority abroad. A thing so true, that whereas other States for the reputation and countenance of publike Magistrates are wont to recommend to their Gouernours, that they maintaine the Maiestie of their soueraigne places, with magnificence and stately comportments both of courage and gorgeous appa∣rell. The Venetian State on the contrary haue enacted Sta∣tutes to forbid any of their Citizens, which supply Offices or charge vnder them in any of their Territories to grace their presence with glorious shewes, or to weare any costly suits of apparell. So great a care haue those politicke Sena∣tors of their Cities thrift and prosperitie. This spake Caualcanti, whē Flauio Biondo said, that whē he was at Venice, he became much astonisht to find in a pure Ari∣stocracie, that the Citizens and Common people liued with such cōtentment in this fortunate coūtry, that in many years of his abode there, he could neuer learne, whether the pub∣like State were better beloued and respected of the Nobility which cōmanded them, or of the cōmon people w ch obeyed. Next to him spake Paulus Iouius, that not onely vnto himselfe, but also vnto many great Princes, with whom hee oftentimes had conference, touching the wonders of Venice, it seemed a thing of great momēt that the Senate of this most famous Republicke, did altogether bend their endeauours vnto Peace, and to no other end at all, withall their vigilancy and care, not studying to make perpetuall preparations for the warres, as others did, whereupon they all concluded, that in this flourishing State alone, a man might find the Lady Peace armed withall exquisite appurtenances. After ovius ensued Iohn Boccace, who said, that the true salt, which preserued the Venetian State from the purrefaction and corruption of abuses, was the soueraigne Queene of all Lawes, that most excellent Order, so inuiolably obserued of her, that for the aduancing of a Senatour to a higher place, not the glory of his Riches, not the merits of his Father, or An∣cestors, nor the multitude of his Tenants or Friends, nor the fauour of great persons, but his owne worth and naked ver∣tue were had in most consideration. From whence it comes to passe, that in Venice the vitious and ignorant Nobles were onely accounted a number, as Ciphers in Arithm ke, while the Vertuous alone, and the best deseruing subiect, bare the chiefe sway, detur Digniori, with that prudent care and circumspection, as is knowne vnto all the world. But Leonardus Aretinus after he had extolled the opinion of Boccace, added, that the excellēt vsage of the Venetian State, in not granting to their Nobilitie, the charge and Offices at the first iumpe, but by degrees, was the true solid foundation, wheron their Greatnesse consisted most firmely built, & with∣all the eternitie of their Libertie. For this is one of their most admired Precepts, That euery Nobleman whatsoeuer, before he mount vp into the highest Dignity, must from his youth vpwards be forced, like an enfranchised Townesman, to beginne from the lowest Offices, and not leaping wise and sodainly. A most safe Custome, as that, which iustly distributed this important effect of vpholding the true and substantiall equality among the Nobilitie of an Aristocracie, which giues long life to a free State, because according to the certaine and vnderstan∣ding policie of true gouernment, the equality of goods made not Senatours equall in a Common-wealth, but that all the Nobles should be first compelled to walke faire and softly to the most eminent places of command from the inferiour steps, which I haue formerly shewed. The which if the Ro∣man Empire had practised, it had not shortned the life of their libertie, nor wrought those dangerous and fatall infirmities of tyrannies and tumults. Their grosse abuses in affording the Consular authority and the charge of armies vnto Pompey, the Caesars, and to other wealthy and powerfull Citizens in their greene and vnsetled youth, was no other then as if they had chosen some of the Bloud-Royall in a Monarchy, as Lords and Patrons of their liberty, rather then Senatours of a well ordered Common-wealth. By which vnwitting er∣rour all men may note, that the freedome of Rome got her mortall wound and vtter desolation. Albeit that the most excellent Lady of the State of Venice gaue apparant signes, that she seemed well contented with the opinion of Aretine, shee commanded notwithstanding th her Vertuous Statesmen, who aduanced themselues for∣wards, to proceed with their opinions. And then Benedict Varchi thus began: My Florentine State, which neuer knew the way of good fortune to bring in among her Noble Fa∣milies, that Peace, Vnion, and mutuall loue, which makes the liberty of a Common-wealth euerlastingly durable, in the end fell into the infirmitie of serui ude, puts me now in a great amazement, and I thinke it may surpasse all other mar∣uells in this State, when I consider with deliberation, that a Nobleman of Venice, although most grieuously offended for the life of his sonnes, and for his owne proper person, en∣forced more with a feruent charity towards the freedome of his Countrey, then terrified with the seuerity of Magistrates, had learned that difficult lesson of resolution, to forgiue at the instant the wrong which he had receiued at his Aduer∣saries hands, and that with a free heart. A resolution worthy of remembrance, and by so much the more wonderfull by how much it is cleerely obserued, that a Nobleman of Venice referres the reuenge of all receiued iniuries into the Senates hand with all willingnesse of mind, the which sensuall and brutish men, yea & many of the wiser sort without the length time and much strugling of nature cannot yeeld vnto God, to whom vengeance belongeth, and from whom wee must all acknowledge our liues, liuing, and liberty to proceed. This Varchi spake, when Lodouico Dulce began the deliuery of his Opinion, that if that were true, which all confessed, that the rarest and most prized greatnesse that might be considered in a Prince, was to disarme with facilitie and without danger one of his war-like Generals, and to receiue of him exact and conformable obedience, for all that that this Generall did a∣forehand know, and long before his returne, how his Prince grew in suspition of his loyalty, or in dislike of his seruice: Then this custome vsual in the state of Venice, deserued more to be wondred at then any other, to be able to disarme with great ease, their Generals and Admirals at Sea. Yea, and at such time when they vnderstood how the Senate was ear∣nestly bent to punish them at their returne, notwithstanding that they found themselues very strong, beloued of their souldiers, and powerfull enough to offend the State, or to de∣fend themselues from shame, it alwayes fell out, that assoone as euer they were sent for, they readily and presently obeyed, voluntarily they resigned ouer their charge, and publike command, and withall speed hastned to Venice, to be senten∣ced by their friends and Citizens, though with Capitall pu∣nishment, which they willingly endured, rather then to ha∣zard the losse of their Countrey by vnnaturall innouations, and ciuill warres. So deare vnto them is the care of the Common safetie. The most excellent Venetian Lady, who without answe∣ring any thing to the Vertuous aboue-named had attentiuely heard all these commendable Orders and admirable Prero∣gatiues said to Dulce, that the matter which he related, was indeed of great consequence, yet not so rare, but that the Ot∣toman Emperours likewise participated of the like benefit. Howbeit neuerthelesse, there was one singular Prerogatiue, which she most exactly possessed, and wherein she excelled all other Principalities, as well of the ancient, as present times, whereto she acknowledged and ascribed all her Great∣nesse, the which as yet she did not heare any of them as much as touch. Then spake Hieronymus Mercurialis, that while he read the Physicke Lecture at the Vniuersitie of Padua, hee knew some of the Plebeian and common sort at Venice, that went in their Gundoloes to disport themselues vpon the water with some young Courtezans, according to their common cu∣stome, and there being mightily misused by certaine young Noble-men, whom they casually met, it chanced that these Plebeians slew one of them in the affray. For which offence vpon complaint made by the parties friends, the Plebeians were sent for by the Iudges, who although they knew the power of the Law to be in the hands of the Nobilitie, whom they had offended, neuer fled, but trusting in the vpright∣nesse and integrity of the Senate and Magistrates, they doub∣ted not to appeare before them, and to yeeld themselues pri∣soners. Neither did their hopes faile them, for vpon consi∣deration of the cause giuen in euidence for their defence, how they were prouoked first by those young Noble-men, they were enlarged and pronounced innocent to the honour of the Venetians vncorrupted Iustice: so that neither power∣full parentage, greatnesse of friends, nor abundance of wealth can blinde and diuert the Iudges of Venice to wrong any man. Last of all, these vertuous States-men spake the most lear∣ned Hermolaus Barbarus, that in a free State Tyranny begins then to vsurpe and worke, when the most weightie secrets concerning the generall good of the Common-wealth, are communicated to a few Senators. And for this cause the most Soueraigne Lady of Venice, to auoid shipwreake on that dangerous rockie shelfe, imparted her Secrets, and delibera∣ted the designes and pragmatickes of greatest import, where∣in her state was interessed in her highest Court of Magistracy or Parliament of the Pregadi, a number cōsisting of two hun∣dred and fiftie Senators and vpwards; and to him it appea∣red to be a miraculous thing, how the Venetian State could finde among so great a number of Senators that Secrecie, which many great Potentates for all their exquisite diligence and large entertainment of gifts and rewards, had bootlesse sought in one only Secrtarie, or in a couple of Counsellors of State. At these words, the most excellent Venetian Lady laid her hand on the shoulders of Barbarus, and pronounced this verdict: Now thou hast hit the naile on the head, and named that most pretious Iewell, wherein I most glory, and prize my selfe aboue all other States, and for which indeed I ought to be iustly emulated and enuied at, seeing that nothing else appertaines for the true gouernment and managing of State-businesse, more necessary than Secracie. CHAP. 11. The Doctors of the Chaire hauing admitted in∣to their Vniuersitie some famous Poeticall La∣dies, Apollo commands them to be dismissed home to their Families. THe famous Doctors of the Chaire, about a few moneths past, admitted the most vertuous Ladies Victoria Colon∣na, Laura Terracina, and other learned Poeticall La∣dies of Parnassus into their Academicall Corporation, where they vsed times to resort to their publike exercises. But it chanced so that many Schollers enamoured with the beau∣tie of these Ladies, did not only flocke oftner than they were accustomed, into the Schooles, whensoeuer they vn∣derstood that these Ladies repaired thither, but also consu∣med their pretious time and wits in composing of amorous Sonnets, which they dedicated vnto these Ladies, as if they were Goddesses, with such rare conceits and lofty tunes, as eclipsed the glory of the Muses themselues. At length the sauour of these Sonnets, though fragrant and sweet in the Schollers apprehensions, offended Apolloes diuine nostrills worse than the stinke of a Blackamore. For which cause before the end of these Ladies probationship and their ma∣triculation, his Maiestie charged the Cathedrall Doctors to dismisse them out of the Vniuersitie. His reason was because he well saw out of his Diuine knowledge, that the true poetry of women were the Needle, the Distaffe, and the Wheele, and that the Schoole exercises of Ladies among Vniuersitie men might well be likened vnto the dalliance and playing of Dogs, which after some fained snar∣ling, catching, and gamesome tossing one ano∣ther, doe conclude their sport in riding and mounting vpon their play-fellowes backs. CHAP. 12. The Lady Victoria Colonna intreats of Apollo, that the infamie which women incurred for cuckolding their Husbands, might likewise ex∣tend to adulterous Husbands. Apolloes answer. THe most Excellent Lady Victoria Colonna a Princesse of exemplarie chastitie, about three daies past appea∣red in his Maiesties Court of Audience, and in the name of all womankind said, that they all loued the excel∣lencie of chastitie, which was naturally giuen them for a most particular vertue, that they did not awhit enuy Courage, a vertue attributed to mans sexe, because they well knew, that a Lady without the soule of chastitie, which renders her o∣doriferous to the world, was but a stinking carcasse: yet notwithstanding it seemed vnto them, that they had much cause to grieue and lament at the great inequalitie, which they saw betwixt the Husband and the Wife in the particu∣lar punishment of Adultery; so that women could not rest contented to see men in such wise free, that the punishment of shame, which alone was wont to terrifie honourable per∣sons, did now lesse serue to restraine them from committing against their wiues these beastly and libidinous defaults. In which dissolute courses they said, that they proceeded so far, that many Husbands were not onely not ashamed to keepe openly Concubines in their houses, but had oftentimes presumed to make them partakers of the sacred bed of Ma∣trimonie. These abuses came to passe, by reason that the Lawes had not prouided the like punishment against the of∣fending Husbands, as were thundred out and practised against adulterous Wiues. And that in this case, the Lawes shewed too much fauour vnto maried men, in allowing them to reuenge the iniurie with their owne hands at the time when they hapned to take their wiues in the adulterous act. By which notorious aggrieuances the Sexe of women being so much wronged, were now forced to repaire vnto the cleare fountaine of true Iustice, to the end that by publi∣shing equall punishment in the equalitie of the self-same fault, there might be some competent remedy ministred for their oppressions. And that if this did not stand with Apol∣loes good will and pleasure, there might be at leastwise the like liberty granted vnto them in this particular of Adultery to keepe amorous seruants, or to marry againe, as many men aduentured to doe. After which liberty granted them, they would not perhaps make vse thereof, but only in terrorem tantùm, vnder colour of law to be enabled to bridle their loose and lustfull Husbands. Vnto this demand of the Lady Victoria, Apollo answered, that the Law of Fidelitie betwixt the Husband and the Wife ought to be indeed equall, and that the defect and breach thereof ought to be punished no lesse in the one, than in the other: but that in the Wife a more exquisite and perfect chastitie was required for the great and weighty respect to know the certainty of their children, to which end Nature had assigned them the noble vertue of Chastitie, the which was so necessarie for procreation of humane kinde, that with∣out it the children should both lose their inheritance and their fathers affection. A thing so true, that Nature herselfe hath most prouidently allotted chaste wiues to all liuing creatures of the earth, where the Male concurres for the in∣dustrious hatching of the Egge, or for the nourishing of their young ones; all to the end that the carke of the fathers be∣ing imployed for their children welfare should proue some∣what pleasing, and that their charge should redound to com∣fort, and to great gaine in time to come. At these words the Lady Victoriaes beautifull cheeks were stained with an honourable blush, who with a Roman inge∣nuitie confessed vnto his Maiestie the simplicitie of her de∣mand, and said, that indeed it were a great shame and disho∣nour to the sexe of women, if in the pretious gift of chastitie they suffred themselues to be ouercome of those vnreasona∣ble liuing creatures, who although they pursue no other thing than pleasure, yet neuerthelesse doe they very religi∣ously obserue Chastitie, because they would not anger the fathers of their young ones by their wandring and inordi∣nate lust. And for the important reason, that Husbands de∣sired to haue their wiues chaste, the lawes against adulterous women were too fauourable, because the wound which the vnchaste Husband giues his Wife did only pierce the skin, whereas the Wife by her lasciuious deeds doth stab and kill her Husband with the poniard of euerlasting infamy, and also doth disparage her children. CHAP. 13. A Poetaster for playing at Cards and deuising the Game called Triumph or Trump, is brought before Apollo, who after he had deep∣ly entred into the mysticall meaning of the said Game, not only dismisseth him, but granteth him an yearely pension to instruct his Courtiers in that new Art. TO the end, that the Ignorant with the filthinesse of their most beastly minds should not profane the ver∣tuous places at Parnassus, Apollo many yeares since caused two companies of Skeltenicall Poets, dogrel Rimers, men that made verses at random, and very aduentrous at ruffianly conceits to come out of Sicily, whose office was to scoure the countrey and to cleare the coast, of vagabonds. These, about eight daies past, tooke prisoner a Poetaster, that had beene capitally banished from Parnassus, who al∣though he was forbidden the vse of all books, and the ex∣ercise of his pen, notwithstanding as it were in despite of Apollo, and in contempt of the sacred Muses, he defiled pa∣per with his dissolute rimes, and at last proceeded so far in his audacious arrogancie, that he assumed vnto himselfe the Soueraigne name of a Poet. This exorbitant fault of his be∣came aggrauated with a paire of Cardes, which those Catch∣poles in searching him had found in his pocket, for which being likewise a notorious Vice and worthy of death they brought him incontinently with the said Cardes before A∣pollo, who when he saw them was wonderfully amazed at the brutish inuention, which the vicious had found out to cast away their pretious time, to consume their reputation, and to spend their meanes. But much more was his Maie∣stie astonished, when he vnderstood, that men now a dayes were growne to such a height of folly, that they vsed to call that thing a Play or Game, whereat they dealt so cruelly in good earnest. And further that they esteemed it a delight, sport, and pastime to put in suspence and to doubtfull com∣promise that money, which was gotten with so much toyle and cares, and serued so necessary for such great vses, that without it, this present world would take Aristotle to bee an ignorant foole, and Alexander the Great a base Ple∣beian. Then Apollo askt the Prisoner, what game at Cards was most familiar vnto him, and because he answered, that it was Trumps or Triumph, his Maiestie willed him to play it. The Prisoner obeyed, and plaide; which when Apollo had ob∣serued & penetrated into the magiste iall lessons and secrets of the Game, he cried out, that this Game of Trumpe was the true Philosophy of Courtiers, the most necessarie Science, which all men ought to learne, that would not be thought innocents or simple-witted. And shewing how much the affront done vnto the prisoner did displease him, he inlar∣ged him presently, and honoured him with the title of a Ver∣tuous man. And the next morning commanded his Officers to erect vp a publike Schoole, where with a stipend of fiue hundred Crownes a yeare, that notable Person for the com∣mon good should reade as a Lecture that excellent Game of Trumpe, and vpon a grieuous penalty to be imposed, hee charged the Platonicks, Peripateticks, the Stoicks, and other Philosophers, specially the Morall; and to all other the Ver∣tuous crew residing at Parnassus, that they should learne this most necessarie Science, the which because they should not forget, he bound them to practise themselues therein one houre at least euery day. Although it seemed strange to the Learned, how it could be possible, that out of a most vile Game deuised by the off-scum raskals of men there might be drawne any profitable document for honest men: yet notwithstanding, they all knowing that his Maiestie neuer commanded any thing, which did not afterward redound to their good and to a speciall purpose, they obeyed so wil∣lingly that this Schoole was in as great request, and frequen∣ted no lesse than an Vniuersitie. But when the Learned had discouered the Magisteriall secrets, the hidden mysteries, and admirable cunning tricks of this triumphant Game of Trumps, they extolled Apolloes profound iudgment to the eighth Heauen, all of them with one voice celebrating and magni∣fying it in all places, that it was not Philosophie, Poetry; nor yet the Mathematicks, nor Astrologie, nor any other famous knowledge, but it was the most rare Game of Trumps, which taught men, chiefly great men and Courtiers, that secret of most import, how euery seuerall Trumpe tooke vp and got, as aprey, euen the goodliest of all the Cards. CHAP. 14. It being noted, that Petus Thraseas in the Compa∣ny of his sonne in law Eluidius Priscus did vse commonly to frequent the house of the Lady Vi∣ctoria Colonna, he is grieuously rebuked by Apollo. IT was obserued by those vertuous Censers, whose office and delight consisted in looking to other mens deeds, that Petus Thraseas, in the company of Eluidius Priscus his sonne in Law extraordinarily haunted the house of the Lady Victoria Colonna, and also of other learned Dames of this Court. And though the said Thraseas were reputed for a man of singular good parts, that one would hardly suspect any obscene or lewd action in so great a Senatour, his vsuall and daily visites together with his continuall abodes in these Ladies houses, occasioned so great a scandall, yea, among the vertuous themselues, that the smell thereof ascended euen to his Maiesties nostrels; who to extinguish the flames of these slanderous murmures, about two dayes since sent for Thrase∣as, and expresly commanded him to reueale what businesse he had in resorting so often to these Ladies houses. Thraseas answered, that he frequented them, onely to exercise charity among these Ladies, by reading euery day vnto them a Chap∣ter of Boetius his booke of the Consolation of Philosophy. Vp∣on this answer Apollo was so grieuously mooued against Thraseas, that in great anger he said: If with your talent and zealous office by giuing office by giuing comfort & consola∣tions to the afflicted, you hope to merit grace at Gods hand, and to obtaine good will among men, goe your wayes to comfort those poore wretches, who die of meere necessitie and pure want in the Hospitalls, or those vnfortunate people, who are condemned to the gallowes or Spanish gallies. But to sit all day long closely among Ladies, as Sardanapalus v∣sed to doe, thinking to make men beleeue, that you exercise Spirituall doings, they are such hypocrisies, as will moue the veriest idiot to laugh at you, and will make them to burst with rage, that know, how these which goe often to the mill become whited with meale. And a man of your wisdome ought to vnderstand, that at such time as a woman conceiues of two infants, which we call Twinnes, if both be male, they are enclosed within one membrane, the which likewise comes to passe, if both bee female. But if it happens, that one bee male, and the other female, most prouident nature preserues the female in a perticular membrane, seuered from the male. Seeing that Nature thought good not to thrust a little bro∣ther and a little sister of that tender age to dwell together in one place, she teacheth all men, and especially men of your fashion to liue more warily and securely; and in these doings, O Thraseas, whosoeuer trusteth his owne power, I hold him to be more rash than wise. And for that these disorders, in regard of our reputation and yours, had need to be corrected, I doe straitly command you, that from henceforth you leaue off such dangerous pra∣ctises. The world is not so sottishly simple, as you more sim∣ply conceiue it, but that they doe well vnderstand, how the visites which men of your qualitie vse vnto Ladies, doe be∣gin to smell after the second time, and specially in their noses, that know, how faire and beautifull things seeme pleasing to all men, and that the prouocation of the flesh is a naturall vice in all men, the which they cannot cure and keepe backe with a more excellent remedy, than to stand a farre off from such faire and goodly obiects: There's no safer way to defend a man from error, than to shunne the occasions. And all your Philosophy cannot produce such proofes, as will make any man of iudgement beleeue, that a dainty bit of flesh doth not agree with euery mans mouth, that is made of flesh. Lastly, I must put you in minde, that a man of your credit and condition, who makes profession aboue all things not to defile the white robe of your Reputation with the sports of lasciuious oile, ought not at all to busie himselfe about lampes; it being not onely great folly, but most insolent rashnesse, worthy of the whip and strapado, to think he can make gun-powder in a forge, where a smith workes nailes, and after∣wards to perswade men, that he might goe to the field with∣out danger. CHAP. 15. A learned Gentleman of Rome begs a remedie of Apollo, to make him to forget certaine grie∣uous wrongs, which he had receiued in the Court of a great Prince: for which cause his Maie∣stie causeth him to drinke a cup-full of the wa∣ter of Lethe, but with vnfortunate successe. A Learned Gentleman of Rome, which some few dayes since arriued at Parnassus, was yesterday admitted to his Maiesties Royall Audience, vnto whom he shewed, that for many iniuries, which hee had receiued of diuers ill willers of his in the Court of a certaine Prince, where the Lawyers persecuted him, and made him pay aboue three score seuerall fees by their cunning trickes of Law, he hath si∣thence liued very much troubled in minde, and so much the more, for that he could not worke his reuenge vpon them without incurring farre greater troubles, then his Enemies had plunged him in. And on the other side, he found that he was not endowed with that generous resolution of forget∣ting and forgiuing them. For which cause, and now to be freed from this hellish torment, wherein he perpetually liued, he repaired to his Maiestie, whom most humbly he intreated to bestow vpon him some present remedie to heale his mind, which was galled with the passions of hatred and reuenge. Apollo did much pitie this Gentlemans case, and comman∣ded that one should giue him a large cup-full of the water of Lethe, prepared in such manner, that it might cause him to forget odious things, and not to take away the remembrance of benefits receiued. The Gentleman with great greedinesse drunke vp the water, the which to all mens wonder was found to haue only the vertue to blot and cancell out of his minde those iniuries, which he had receiued of his inferiours in condition; and that the iniuries which were done vnto him, by greater persons than himselfe, had inflamed and ex∣asperated his minde rather with an euerlasting memory of them, than any way caused him to forget them. Whereat many began to murmur, that the famous water of Lethe had lost that pretious vertue, which the Poets had blazed of it. But his Maiestie gaue them to vnderstand, that the water of Lethe had euermore the same vertue, which it had in the beginning. And in that it did not worke the expected effect in that Gentleman; the reason was, be∣cause persons nobly descended, and of great spirits, had euer this custome proper vnto their natures, to write in the sand these iniuries, which they receiued of base people; but in so∣lid marble with eternall characters those aboue-handed blowes, which were giuen them by their equalls, or superi∣ours; it being the propertie of a noble mind to remit wrongs by magnanimitie, but not to pardon them of necessitie. CHAP. 16. Apuleius his golden Asse, and Plautus his Asse doe complaine vnto Apollo of the great seueritie which their Masters vsed in beating them. But they are sent away with no pleasing answer. ABout the eight of the Current Apuleius his famous Asse accompanied with Plautus his Asse, appeare be∣fore Apolloes Maiestie, who in the name of all the sort of Mules, Asses, and Pack-horses, said, that if any kinde of beasts subiect to mankind, which were of small expence and of much profit, had deserued better vsage than others; they had most reason aboue all other beasts, to grieue at their Ma∣sters rough and rigorous dealings. And although they bare the whole burthen of their Lords houses, and maintained them both day and night by their perpetuall labours, and were content to feed ordinarily on sedge, straw, and water, and to keepe their Shrouetide with branne, and such poore prouender; all this notwithstanding they were ingratefully, cruelly, and with great indiscretion entreated by their Ma∣sters, and being the most vnhappie of all creatures, they were now become the miserable spectacle of all drudgery. For as much as they could not by their prostrate and humble ser∣uices mollifie the passionate minds of their Lords, they peti∣tioned his Maiestie in most lowly manner to commiserate their Asinine miseries, if not to conclude and end them, yet at least to order the matter so, that by his Maiesties command their Patrons would thenceforth vse them, though not grate∣full respects for their great seruices, yet with moderation of passion, and with more hmanitie. Vnto these Apollo answered, that the seuerity, which Ma∣sters vsed towards their pack-horses, whereof they so bitterly complained, proceeded not out of their Masters naturall cru∣eltie, since that it is plaine, that no man yet hated the vtilitie and benefit of his heritage, but rather from their monstrous sloth, and stupendious stupiditie of the pack-horses, through which most brutish defaults, their Masters were enforced furi∣ously with whips and goads to pricke them on to doe that la∣bour, which otherwise for want of quickness they had not spirit enough of themselues to performe. And whoso∣euer would exactly iudge and determine of any mans cruell and rigorous dealings, he had need not on∣ly to haue regard vnto the genius and nature of him that exerciseth and vseth this cor∣rection, as to the qualitie and man∣ners of him, that complaines he is hardly dealt with. CHAP. 17. A generall Reformation of the world by the seuen wise men of Greece, and by other Learned men, is published by expresse Order from A∣pollo. IVstinian the Emperor, that great Composer of the Codes and Pandects, some few dayes since brought a new Law vnto Apollo, to haue the same approoued of his Maiestie, whereby it was straightly forbidden, that any man should waxe so cruell against his owne person, as to be the Authour of his owne death. Apollo seeing this Law, had it in so great horrour, that with a sigh, which proceeded from the bottome of his heart, he brake forth into these speeches: Is the good gouernment of Mankinde precipated into such disorder, O Iustinian, that they will now a dayes voluntarily attempt their owne deathes, because they will not liue any longer, as they ought? And wheras I haue hitherto hired a great num∣ber of the wisest morall Philosophers, to the end that with their tognes and writings they should Minister vnder mee graue and ciuill conceits vnto others, which might make Death seemed lesse terrible, are things now reduced to that great calamity, that men wil no longer liue, not yet learn to accommodate thēselues to die well? And do I carelesly sleep, while these disorders abound among my learned Fraterni∣tie? To these words of Apollo, Iustinian answered, that this Law was very necessary, and that many notorious effects ha∣uing happened by these desperate courses, more inconueni∣ences would yet ensue, if his Maiestie did not in time pro∣uide some conuenient remedy to salue the wilfull disorders of these Franticke fellowes. Whereupon Apollo tooke dili∣gent Information of that manner of life, which the world lead, and found that it became extraordinarily depraued with euill customes, the which to reforme hee resolued to create a Congregation of some notable Personages, the most prudent and ingenuous Polititians of his Empire. But in the very beginning of this serious talke he met with inuin∣cible difficulties, for being come to the point, to appoint a number of subiects among his Morall Philosophers, and those innumerable Vertuous Spirits which attended his Court, he could not light on any to his absolute liking, suffi∣ciently enabled for so great a businesse, by reason that his Maiestie knew, that the sanctitie of life, and the good exam∣ple of the Reformer wrought a greater force and power in them, w ch were to be reformed, then the best Rules, which the wisest State could enact and publish. In this penurious exi∣gent, Apollo referred the charge of the Worlds vniuersall re∣formation to the seuen wise men of Greece, men that are held and reputed to be in the chiefest credit at Parnassus, was those which in all mens conceit haue learnt the receit and way to make straight the Dogs leg, which with so much paines (yet alwayes in vaine) Antiquity hunted after. The rumour of these newes being come to the Grecians eares, it reioyced them exceedingly for the honour, which his Maie∣stie vouchsafed vnto their Nation; as on the other side, it much troubled the Latines, it seeming vnto them, that they herein had singular great wrong offered vnto them to be ex∣cluded. Apollo perceiuing, that this emulation might much hinder the generall Reformation, to take away all impedi∣ments, and to yeeld some satisfaction to the discontented Ro∣mans, to those Grecian Sages he adioyned Marcus Cato and Annaus Seneca, and in fauour of the Italian Philosophers, hee constituted Iacobus Mazzon Secretary of the Congregation, whom he graced with a consultiue voyce. Vpon the ninteenth day of the aforesaid moneth, all these famous Sages and new Reformers brauely accompanied with a great Troupe of the Noblest Vertuous of this State went into the Delphick Palace, the place appointed for this businesse of Reformation, and to the Learned it was a plea∣sing sight to behold the great number of Pedantes, which with table-books in their hands went quoting and laying downe the Sentences and Apothegmes, which these conti∣nually let slip out of their harmonious mouths. As soone as these learned and wise Lords were reunited to declare their remedies, the fame is, that Thales the Mi∣lesian, the first of the seuen Sages, began in this manner: Most prudent Philosophers; The businesse for which we are now here assembled together, is the greatest, which the wit of man can treat of; and although no other enterprise may be found so hard, as to heale an inueterate Neapolitane bone-ache, an infistulated Gangrene, an incurable Canker, yet notwithstanding, the insuperable difficulties, which weare out other mens braines, ought to animate men of our ranke to ouercome them, seeing that the supposed impossibilitie of the Cure will augment our glory, and will maintaine vs still in that sublime and high degree of reputation, wherein we are eleuated; and now I firmly assure my selfe, that I haue found out the true Antidote for the easie expulse of these venemous and banefull corruptions. I am confident, that there is not any of vs, but assures himselfe, that no other disease hath infected the healthfull life of this present Age, than the hidden hatred, dissimulation, equiuocation, and treachery of men couered ouer with the faire mantle of Re∣ligion, of Loue, Simplicitie, and Charity; the which, my good Lords, being corrected with Cauteries, Razours, and with Corrosiue Plaisters fit for this cancred wound, such as I shall now discouer, all men liuing, which at this time are by these vices brought euen to Deaths doore, all other Physiti∣ans hauing left them without hope of recouery, shall sud∣denly become restored to their former health, and shall re∣sume that sinceritie, that verity of speech, and that holinesse of life, which in ancient times hath beene esteemed true-hearted candour, genuine simplicitie, and plaine dealing. The true remedie then is of necessitie to reduce men into an ingenuous kinde of liuing, and to embrace that simplicitie of the heart, which they can neuer doe, before Princes haue with their high authoritie chased out of their Kingdomes irreligious hypocrites of a different Religion, as Wolfes of State, and also to cut off wrangling suits at Law; nor these can they euer bring to passe without diminishing the num∣ber of Lawyers, and needlesse Courts of Iustice, which hearten euen sheepe to turne vpon their keepers. These, these abuses, most vertuous Lords, being so restrained, then lies, falshoods, double dealing, and hypocrisies, will depart, as the chiefe nourishment of the Infernall Spirit out of the possessed soules homeward to their Master the Deuill. In such wise did this opinion of Thales worke within the rest of the Sages hearts, that he was ready to goe away with all their suffrages and voices, when Mazzon the Secretary commanded him to rehearse the same vnto Apollo, who ap∣proued so well of Thales his remedy, that he commanded out of hand a Chirurgion to make a little window in the heart of man. But in the same houre, when the Chirurgion had prepared his instruments to open the breast of man for that purpose, Homer, Virgil, Plato, Aristotle, Auerroes, and some other learned men repaired to Apollo, and signified vn∣to his Maiestie, that the chiefest instrument, which with great facilitie gouerned the world, was the reputation of those which commanded it, and that a iewel of that worth ought neuer to be exposed vnto any perill by wise Princes. They laid before his Maiesties consideration the credit of a holy life, the opinion of the bounty of customes, wherein the excellent Philosophicall Senate, and the Honourable Col∣ledge of the Vertuous were had in great reuerence among all the learned Subiects of Apolloes Empire. And if his Maie∣stie would suddenly cause all mens hearts to be opened, the greatest and best sort of his Vertuous Followers could not but suffer infinite shame & infamie, whonow were in chiefe credit about his sacred Person, when they should see euen boyes to take notice of their foolishnesse, as who is wise at all seasons? Yea and his Maiestie himselfe would grow into hatred with his most principall Fauourites, when hee saw they were not such notable persons of an vnspotted life as he reputed them to be. And by these meanes he should lose the most part of his Dependants, to the vtter depopula∣ting of famous Parnassus. And for this cause, before his Maiestie would attempt this important enterprise, they humbly desired in the name of all the Vertuous, to grant them some competent time to purifie their mindes, and to lay them a little a bucking. The aduise of these famous per∣sons greatly pleased. Apollo, and by a publike Edict he pro∣rogued the terme of making the window vntill eight daies were expired, in which time the Vertuous in such manner toyled themselues in cleansing their minds of all hidden fallacies, of counterfeit friendship, of inbred rancour, and other stinking vices, that in the Grocers, Druggists, and Apothecaries shops of Parnassus, all the sweet Con∣serues, Cinnamon, Cassia, Syrops, Lozenges, Roses, Violets, and other pretious wares were all spoiled with the taint, and the stench abounded so corrupt, that all the quarters of the Platonick and Peripatetick Philosophers, smelt worse than if the filthiest I akes of the Countrey were emptied; whereas the street of the Latin and Italian Poets, smelt only like the broth of reheated Coleworts. Now the time for the vni∣uersall bucking and purifying, that was limited, became almost ended, when the day before the opening of the win∣dow in mens hearts, the great Hippocrates, Galen, Cornelius Celsus, and other experimented Physitians of this State went to Apollo, and freely spake their minds in this manner: Royall Sir, if this worke goes forward, wee must needs deface this little world of mankinde, most noble for the mi∣raculous workmanship, wherewith it is wrought with eui∣dent perill of an important musckle and a principall veine, and by that meanes kill and destroy the whole fabricke of Mans Microcosme, or at least make it for euer sickly and cra∣zed. And so great an euill we might practise onely by the benefit of foure ignorant persons, seeing that not only the profoundest wits, but likewise men of meane iudgement onely with foure daies practise, which they may haue with any notable Hypocrite whatsoeuer, they know how to pe∣netrate into the most inward gutt. With Apollo this speech of the Physitians so preuailed, that he resumed his former deliberation, and by Ausonius Gallus made it knowne vnto the Lords Reformers, that they should continue their Philoso∣phicall opinions. Then Solon thus began: The cruell hatred and poyson∣full enuie, which vniuersally breed among men, and domi∣neere ouer them in these daies, are these, most prudent Lords, which to my thinking haue so confounded the world in the case, as we see it. The correction then consisteth in insu∣sing of Charitie in mens hearts, and the sacred loue towards their Neighbours, which is one of the Precepts of God. We must now imploy the whole engine of our ablest wits to take away the occasions of Hatred, which make them so sa∣uage and implacable. I haue to the vttermost of my vnder∣standing diued into the mysticall cause of this Hatred, and I finde it to proceed of the inequalitie of worldly goods by that hellish vsage of Mine and Thine among our worldlings, the very rock of all scandals. And it is manifest, that mens mindes depraued by Ambition, Couetousnesse, and Tyran∣nie, haue occasioned this inequality and disproportioned Di∣uision. And seeing that is true, which all must confesse, that this world is no other than an inheritance left by one Father and one Mother vnto mankind, from whom as Brothers we all descend; what Iustice is there, but that euery one of vs should not haue share and share like throughout all the wide world, the one as well as the other? But now it falls out otherwise, that the Good and Vertuous haue the least part, and the wicked the greatest part: The honest man a begger, the dishonest by a preposterous order haue gotten their right, and will not communicate the same, no not to their owne flesh and bloud, and neerest kinne. Now I haue dis∣couered vnto you the wound, it is easie to apply the medi∣cine. The best aduise which I can giue, is to come vnto a new diuision of the world, and to let euery man haue his share; and by this meanes there will be enough for euery one of vs without troubling one another: Though Tyrants and Lawyers may for a time grudge at this equalitie, yet true Iustice requires it for the pacifying of this vnnaturall hurly∣barly. And further to take away all disorders in time to come, let there bee a Law enacted to forbid all chopping and changing, all buying and selling to the worlds end. A long time this opinion of Solon was canuased, the which although it was esteemed necessary, but not altoge∣ther good, by Bias, Periander, and Pittacus, was reproued notwithstanding by the rest of the Philosophicall Lords; whiles that the iudgement of the wise Seneca preuailed, who with most liuely reasons made all the Lords of the Con∣gregation to vnderstand, that if now they should come to a new diuision of the world againe, there would ensue a very great disorder, that too great a part would fall into the share of Gluttons, and too little among braue Spirits, who hold Sobriety, Temperance, and Reason, the chiefe meanes to di∣stinguish them, which beare the image of God in their soules from bestiall Satanicall creatures; and that the Plague, Fa∣mine and Warre were not, as many thought, the most rigo∣rous scourges wherewith God in his anger afflicts mankind, but that the sorest and most grieuous whip, wherewith he may torment them, is to enrich villaines, and base minded misers, whose pelfe will at last worke the ruine of their dea∣rest and better part being their Soules. As soone as Solons opinion was refelled, Chilon produ∣ced his: Which of you (quoth he) most wise Philosophers, knowes not, That the insatiable thirst of Gold and Siluer hath not occasioned such mischiefes in the world, as wee all see and many of vs haue felt? What impietie, what wickednesse, what vnnaturall act is there, which men will not commit, and that with all diligence, to rake together a masse of money and wealth? Conclude yee then all cou∣ragiously with me, that to root those vices out of the world wherewith this Age is corrupted, there is no better way than to exterminate and vtterly to abolish the vse of those pestife∣rous mettals, Gold and Siluer, the true prouocations of all these miseries: Irrimenta malorum. Very goodly and specious in apparance seemed the sen∣tence of Chilon, but when it came to the scanning and triall, it proued not solid at the stroke of the hammer of liuely rea∣sons. Because it was answered, that men had brought the vse of Gold and Siluer, that it might stand for the measure and counterpoyse of all bargains & commerce betwixt party and party. And if Gold and Siluer were prohibited, they must of force imploy some other mettall or commoditie to sup∣ply their necessities, which likewise would replenish the world with the same greedinesse of minde as before: As in some part of the Indies they vse shels as currant as wee doe money. And Cleobulus in particular with a kinde of Iro∣nicall scoffe said; My Lords, we may as well banish out of the world Iron, seeing that it is also a mettall, which hath wrought infinite confusion among men. Gold and Siluer for the vse destinated of God to be the balancing proportion of all things, whereas Iron produced of Nature to make Ploughs, Spades, Harrowes, necessarie tooles for tillage and gardens, as for buildings, hath beene maliciously per∣uerted toswords, poniards, and other instruments of war to destroy mankind. With this opinion of Cleobulus, albeit most true, it was neuerthelesse concluded by all the Lords of the Reforma∣tion, that it being a thing impossible to conuert Iron from men without peruerting Iron, it should be no prudence to multiply their miseries, and to heale the wound with more blowes. Vnanimously it was resolued and concluded, that men should still retaine the mettals of Gold and Siluer, but to admonish the Refiners to take care for the well purifying of them, & not to lift them off from the fire, vntill they were throughly assured that they had cleansed them from that clammie and fast clinging Turpentine, which these kinde of mettals haue in them, which caused that their Coines stucke exceeding fast to mens hands, yea sometimes to their hands, whom the world reputes for honest men. After this with extraordinary grauity Pitiacus began thus: The world, most learned Philosophers, is fallen into deplorable miseries, because this moderne generation of mankind haue relinquished the beaten way of Vertue, and haue chose to walke through those crooked by-paths of Vice, whereby they steale away those Rewards due onely to the Vertuous. Things are now reduced, Lords, to this passe, that no man enters into the house of Dignities, of Honors, & of Rewards as in old time, through the Gate of Merit, true de∣sert, and by vertuous paines, but by the windowes they clam∣mer, like vnto filching theeues, which climbe to peare-trees with their back-sides turned to the true owners. Yea, and we haue known some, with the force of fauours and Violence of Bribes haue not beene ashamed to enter through the tops of Chimneyes, and by casting downe the tiles, haue through the very roofe come into the house of Honour. To amend this corrupted course of behauiour, the best way in my iudgement is to decree vpon paine of Death, that no man hereafter be so hardy, as to get into any well-deseruing place, whether it be of Honor or Gaine, but by the Royall high∣way of Desert; and to shut vp all other darke and damnable wayes, onely fit for Scritchowles, and Sauage Beasts. This is a great disheartning of our Learned rancke. Wherehence ma∣ny of our best vnderstanding Spirits doe verily beleeue, that those Hypocrites haue ioyned vnto their Craft the Spels of the Magicke Art, and thereby, like Zoroastres, they bewitch, enchant, an taint the mindes of some Princes, yea and those of the wiser sort. All the Reforming Lords admired this speech of Pittacus, and were about to conclude with him, if Periander had not thus opposed: The disorder specified by Pittacus, most pru∣dent Lords, is very true; but for what cause a iudicious and wise Prince refuseth to preferre vertuous and learned men so pleasing to God, so honourable and profitable for his State: and wherefore in their stead hee serues himselfe, being the life and fountaine of all goodnesse, or at least seeming so to be, with debauched, vnworthy, and base-minded wretches, is a point of great import and to be considered of vs. I know the common opinion is, that the Prince chuseth men which are like to humour and sooth him vp in his affections before the best deseruing Creature. And I acknowledge that it is a Rule of State, for a wise Prince to aduance no man to any de∣gree but either for his wisedome or valour. This founda∣mentall Rule of State is well knowne vnto him, yet experi∣ence sheweth, that few Princes practise it, and mocke at such as shall tell them that they doe the contrary by a carelesse re∣spect to the honour of their place. But the truth is, they pro∣mote ignorant persons, new fellowes, and of small desert be∣fore learned and vertuous men, not by any default of their side, but by errors (I am sorry to speake it) of the learned and vertuous themselues. I confesse with you, that Princes haue need of such, and of braue minded Commanders for the warres. But none of you will deny, but they stand in more need of loyall and faithfull Ministers of State, who with the gift of Secrecie may stead them as much as all their Treasure. And now it is more than apparant, that if honourable perso∣nages and valiant Souldiors had bin as true & Secret to their Countrey, as they ought, we should not behold the infinite disorders, which we see and obserue to our great griefe in this present age, euen Pigmeyes in foure dayes to shoot vp as tall as Giants, and all these vnworthy spectacles to happen for want of Fidelity, and firme regard to the interest of State. So corrupted is the mind of many men, that forgetting their owne worths and valorous magnamities, they will bee tempted with gold and ambition, yea and after sufficient promotion by their natiue Prince some haue turned so vn∣thankfull, as to become mercenary slaues to another Prince. Which disasters Princes distrusting, they are faine to confer Honour and Offices vnto vnworthy persons, who might serue them with their Secrecie and Fidelity, and proue more thankefull for their fauours. As soone as Periander had ended his Opinion, Bias spake in this wise: There is not any among vs here, but knowes, most wise Lords, that the world is become so much depra∣ued, because Mankind is departed from those sacred Lawes of a contented state, the which God from the beginning al∣lotted vnto euery Nation, hauing assigned seuerall stations, out of which they ought not to breake out. The Britaines, diuisos orbe Britannos, he hath placed in Albion, as in another world by themselues, the Gothes in France, the Spaniards in Spaine, the Dutch in Germany, the Italians in Italy, and so o∣ther Nations in other habitations. And because euery one of them should not trespasse, or like a Deluge breake out vp∣on their bordering Neighbours. His foreseeing Maiestie fra∣med the fearefull Ocean to compasse about Great Britaine, the Pyrenaean Mountaines, as a wall betwixt France and Spaine, and the Alpes betweene the Germanes and Italy, as some part of them deuides this from France also. The like wary diuision the Diuine Maiestie hath set betwixt Europe & Africke, as the Mediterranean Seas. The which hee did of purpose, that none should encroch vpon the other, and not mingle one with anothers language, as heretofore fell out at Babel, nor subiect the other to forraigne Lawes and Cu∣stomes, whereby each one liuing at home with their neerest kinne might agree the better together without innouations or Tyrannies, and not like Drones, intrude into other mens liues to purloyne the sweet, which others wrought. Now for as much as the world is infected with the company and cu∣stomes of strange Nations, let euery Nation be ordered to re∣turne into his proper limitation; and for feare of the like so∣daine and violent intrusions in time to come, let it be also enacted, that no ships be suffered to passe for the space of ma∣ny yeares to come, nor any to be built, and if any Bridges lie betwixt seuerall Principalities, to sunder them the better, that these Bridges be pulled downe. If this course be taken, peo∣ple shall liue more peaceably in their owne natiue soile. With wondefull great attention this Declaration of Bias was heard, the which notwithstanding it was subtilly examined by the profound wits of the Congregation, at the last seemed not expedient to be put in practise, by reason that they knew that the hatred, though excessiue, which reigned amogst diuers Nations, are not naturall, as some very simply haue coniectured, but occasioned either by the artificiall sleights of some Princes, or at least by the cunning tricks of some of their principall Ministers to busie their Princes and States braines, while they enriched their Cofers with part of the Treasures, which were to be laid out for the warres, or casual∣ly brought into the Kingdome from the warres, as prizes and booties. Besides, some Princes are skilfull masters to put in execution that old Maxime of policie: Diuide & Impera; Diuide and command. As for Bias his counsell to forbid Nauigation, who knowes not but among all Nations vnited together that harmonicall perfection is pickt out for politi∣call Gouernment, which cannot be found in any one particu∣lar States, and this is gotten by peregrination into forreine countries, so that an expert Traueller returnes home like the grand Vlysses, hauing bettered his vnderstanding facultie by noting the diuersities of Spirits, manners, Lawes and Cu∣stomes. To this may be added the other exceeding great be∣nefits, as arise by Nauigation, as the establishing of Plantati∣ons, where their owne countrey ouerswarmes with multi∣tudes of people, the transportation of Commodities, and the ciuilizing of Sauage Nations. They obserue the wonderfull difference of Climates, the seuerall natures of the cold, the temperate, and the Torrid Zones, with many other remarke∣able euents, to the glory of our Creatour and their vnspeake∣able pleasure. Then Cleobulus desired leaue to speake, who boldly thus began: As farre I see, we proceed like those light-headed fellowes, who make publike Languages with new conceits and curious fancies, to the outside beautifull, but not with matter of profit, as might edifie and reforme the world, the onely cause of our meeting at this time. To what purpose then for the rooting out of Vias should we open a window in mans heart, as Thales would fain perswade his Imperiall Maiestie? Wherefore should we vndertake that most paine∣full charge and taske for the diuiding of the vast wide world into equall parts, as Solon proposed? The opinions of Chi∣lon for banishing of Gold and Siluer out of the world, of Pit∣tacus to enforce men to walke the beaten way of Merit and Vertue, of Bias to limit men their habitations, and to forbid Nauigation the miracle of this world, what are all these but Sophisticall Dreames, and Chymerizing Ideas of shallow imaginatiue Schollers, no way participating of the practicke reall way to extreminate those moderne corruptions, which are crept into the world? we must not treat of impossibilities, but fall to mat ers actually in earnest, and to be put in execu∣tion, not how things ought to be done, but how substantially to reforme the world, according as now we find it most strangely deformed; and this we must performe warily, se∣cretly, and without long arguing pro and con, or criticall ani∣maduersions, the cause of new tumults. In briefe then I say, that all the reformation of this present Age consisteth in these few words: To reward the good, and to punish the wicked. Here Cleobulus rested, against whom Thales thus violent∣ly opposed, shewing vnto all men, how dangerous a thing it is, albeit for the Truths sake, to offend those persons, who liue in the repute of Freedome and Prudence, which made this sage Philosopher breake forth into these speeches: Both these Reuerend Lords and my selfe, most wise Cleobulus, see∣ing that you had derided and despised our Opinion as So∣phisticall and Chymerizing, expected some rare proiect to proceed from your prudent braine, or that you had brought from the Indies some new and miraculous Bezoar for the so∣daine cure of the present enormities, when you sleighted our cares, and propounded a Receit more, I will not say difficult, but indeed impossible, w ch might pose & go beyond euen the most curious Princes of secrets, Caius Plin. & Albertus Mag∣nus. There is not any of vs here, my Cleobulus, but knows, that the reformatiō of the world depēds vpō rewarding the good, and punishing the wicked. Therefore let me demand of you, I pray, who be those good men and those wicked? And then I will returne you this resolution, that that man liueth not, which can discerne and distinguish Truth from Hypocrisie. Doe you not perceiue, that counterfeit Art and dissimulation are in these times growne to that height of perfection, that a great number of Spirits are so artificially and cunningly wicked, which seeme to wise men to be currantly good? And that those good men, which liue sincerely, ingenuously, simply, as innocent as Doues, without the least painting or dawbing of Hypocrisie, are reputed scandalous, and of a li∣bertine loose behauiour? All men naturally loue the good, and hate the euill. Yea and most Princes themselues doe so as well by naturall instinct, as in respect of Interest of State. And when Hypocrites or slie crafty knaues are exalted to promotion, and the good are vilipended and neglected, that comes to passe not by the Election of Princes, but through the deceit and fraudulent tricks of others. Onely true bounty and ingenuous Candour are knowne to God and by him rewarded. By him Vices are discouered & punished, for he alone entreth into the depth and profundity of the heart. Yea, and my selfe too with opening the window in mans breast had pierced into the bottome of mens thoughts, had not the enemy of this honest proiect and profitable field wherein I had sowne this memorable Graine, cast in before me his Seed of Tares. Incredible satisfaction did these words of Thales produce to the Congregation, who casting their eyes vpon Perian∣der, he as if he had been bidden to shew his reason, thus be∣gan: The diuersitie of Opinions, which hitherto I haue heard of you, most prudent Philosophers, confirme mee in my ancient Opinion, tht many a man doth die, because Phy∣sitians haue not apprehended the certainty of their Patients disease. For which errours of theirs, they are to be excused, because men may easily be deceiued in these things, to the knowledge of which they walke onely with the feet of aime and coniecture. But for vs, who are thought by his Maiesty, to be the curers of the world, to be ignorant in the cure of this diseased world, it is the mor shame, by how much the disease increaseth. Yet as farre as I see hitherto by reason of the varieties of the medicines, wee goe about to heale the arme in stead of the breast that is corrupted. The truth is, that Disorders haue euer raigned among men. But now adaies by reason of the Worlds decrepit age, which cause men to abound with Auarice, Ambition, and Pride, the true occa∣sions of Hatred. These being occasioned by some mighty Potentates, which intrude vpon their Neighbours states, haue bred in continuance of time iealousies, warres, and as it were an hereditary heart-burning of one Nation against the other. The medicine therefore is, that Princes repent them, and content themselues with a moderate fortune, lea∣uing their neighbours at rest, and not vnder some imagi∣narie pretences challenge a Catholicke Supremacie ouer their brethren. Here Periander ended his discourse, whom Solon thus op∣posed: The true causes of the present euills, O Periander, were not omitted by vs of ignorance, as you perhaps sup∣pose, but of a wary circumspection. The world from the beginning hath bin corrupted, and still continues. Yet it is a point of Prudence to winke at some disorders, rather than with danger to seeke to remoue them. All men liuing haue some faults. And many dishonourable acts which Princes perpetrate, we must not meddle with, lest we aggrauate and make them incurable, whom Time may correct. Therefore let a wise man either speake charitably of their spots, or hold his peace. For we shall finde worke enough to reforme the hatred of the common sort; by whom they proceed wee must not scan, but referre the prime workers of their disor∣ders to the King of Kings, who sometimes hardens Pha∣raohs for their owne ruine, or Nebuchadnezzars for scour∣ges to punish his rebellious seruants. With these words, applauded of the Congregation, Solon made end of his speech. After whom Cato began in this manner: Exceeding well haue yee parlied, O graue and fa∣mous Grecians, in shewing the meanes to supplant and sup∣presse Hatred and other humane vices. But as I conceiue, they are those, which languish of an incurable Ptisick, which spit vp their lungs, and do cast off their haire. In men there is no helpe; therefore the best aduice which I can giue, is to desire a finall consummation of the world, and for vs to ioyne in prayer to the Diuine Maiestie, to open the Cata∣racts and windowes of Heauen to drowne the whole Earth againe, yet with prouiso, to preserue in new Arks all those male children, which haue not past twelue yeares of age, and that of all the Feminine Sexe, of what age soeuer, there may remaine no other thing behind them, saue their vnlucky memorie. And I beseech the Diuine Maiestie, that euen as he hath allotted vnto Bees, Fish, and to other infinite crea∣tures, that prized and singular benefit to breed without the helpe of the Female kinde, that the like grace he will graunt vnto men. For, my Lords, I am assured, that while women liue in the world, that men will proue but a Swinish heard of vngratious brood. It is not possible to beleeue, how much the Congregation did stomacke this discourse of Cato, who had this conceit of the new Deluge in such horrour, that all the rest of the Ho∣nourable Philosophers fell prostrate vpon the ground with their hands lift vp towards Heauen, and deuoutly desired God to preserue the pretious Sexe of Women, and to defend Mankind from any such inundations, which none would wish but frantick braines, or Chymerizing Heteroclites; and also to protect them from fraudulent Make-bates, who vn∣der colour of the Lawes with their mercenarie tongues put euen the best natur'd by the eares; and that if men would not be ruled to follow more wholsome counsell, hee would beat them with his scourges of Famine, Warre, and Pesti∣lence, vntill they were made to know themselues, and their duties to their Neighbours; And if it pleased not his Ma∣iestie to be so seuere and rigorous, yet that he would vouch∣safe of his Soueraigne Bounty to grant this one request, Not to enrich villaines. This vnhappy euent had the opinion of Cato, when Se∣neca thus began his Discourse: The Reformations of these moderne abuses, as I conceiue, ought not to be handled too bitterly, before they be first dealt with gentle hands, and managed with some milde medicines in the beginning of their Cure. For what shame will redound to that Physi∣tian, whose Patient happens to die with his Recipe still in his body remaining? To passe from one extremitie to an other, and to neglect the due meanes is rash counsell; be∣cause Man is not capable of sudden and violent mutations. And seeing that wee finde that the world in thousands of yeares is now fallen into this dangerous infirmity of calami∣ties, he is not very wise, nay very foolish, which thinks in a few daies to reduce this corrupted body to his former health. A grosse and corpulent person, if the Physitian thinks it expedient to bring him low and leane, is to be prescribed a Diet of one kind of meat at his meale, and to feed each day lesse than other, that so by degrees he forgoe his gurmandise and gluttonous custome. And so a sickly person vpon his recouerie, or a Sea-man returning from a long voyage must for the first fortnight sup broths, gellies, and such weake nourishments, vntill time reduce him stronger to feed on stronger meats; to which agrees that Aphorisme of Hippo∣crates, Corpora, quae longo tempore extenuantur, lentè refi∣cere oportet. Besides this, both the quality of the Reformers, and the condition of them which haue need of reformation, are to be considered. As for example, our selues, who at this present are appointed to reforme the World, if the par∣ties to be reformed, are Schollers, Book-sellers, Clerks, Pen and Inke men, or such like, we may preuaile to censure and correct their faults. But if we goe out of our limits, and enter into other mens professions and trades to reforme their enormities and knauish customes, we shall proue like that ridiculous Cobler, who going beyond his naule, presu∣med to iudge of colours, and to censure the exquisite picture of Apelles. Let vs which are Schollers meddle with matters onely in our clement. Which of vs, I pray here, haue euer dealt among Taylors, to iudge of their deceits; among Vintners, to tell of their sophisticating of wines; among Butchers, to shew their blowing vp of fl sh; among Clergy∣men, to censure of Simony; or among Lawyers, to entrap them in their equiuocations, quirks, and quillets? yet all these require reformations, and the whole Earth grones and cries for ease and peace. But shall we aduenture to put our hands to hinder these disorders so far remote from our pro∣fessions? Shall we like so many blind bayards, endeuour to stop bottles so crackt and cleft, and by that meanes let all the wine to spill about the roome? Then surely will a true Reformation fall out, and not before, when the Mariner is called forth to shew his iudgment of the Seas and Winds, the Souldier of marshalling a Battell, the Shepheard of his fleece, and he that hath beene beaten by Lawyers and baf∣feld by their iuglings, can best demonstrate vnto vs, how to tame their Hydra furies and poysonous qualities. There∣fore let vs call vnto vs out of euery Craft, Mysterie, and Pro∣fession, foure of the honestest, most renouned for their inte∣gritie of life, and confer with them touching the meanes, how to amend what is amisse. Although this graue counsell greatly pleased Pittacus and Chilon, yet all the rest detested it as bad as Catoes, saying, that he offred them a scandalous affront, and an indignitie to Apollocs Maiestie, to call in such base-minded people not traind vp in Philosophy to be ioyned with men of their de∣gree. And that they were the Soules pretious faculties, which gaue the well-being to a businesse of this nature, which those wanted. Further, they concurred in this pur∣pose, with might and maine, to preserue the Iurisdiction of their Philosophicall Court, whereof they protested to be as iealous as Husbands of their fairest Wiues; And that they thought so wise a man as Seneca was reputed to be, being the Archphilosopher of the Latines would haue yeelded to haue twenty ounces of his bloud drawne out of the best veine of his life, than to perswade them to lose one ounce of their Iurisdiction, whereon their reputation consisted. The Lords Reform s after they had thus checkt Seneca, were wonderfully perplext, and in a manner hopelesse of effecting any good, because Mazzon who was yet to speake, they adiudged a new man, and without experience. Yet now that his turne came to speake, he thus pithily spake: Not by any desert of mine, most prudent Philosophers, but by his Maiesties meere and speciall fauour am I admitted into this Honourable Assembly. And I freely acknowledge, that at this vertuous meeting it were my part to imploy my eares, rather than my tongue, being fitter to learne and to be si∣lent. And if that any other matter had beene to be determi∣ned sauing this, I would not presume to speake. But because the subiect now in hand concernes the reformation of mo∣derne disorders, which now adaies raigne in the world, I being a moderne man, euen now come from the world, where I left them continually disputing and keeping a stir about reformations, am the better incouraged to lay my hel∣ping hand, and though I say it, I am as good a Proficient in this matter, as Euclide in the Mathematicks. The true cure of the bodies disease is to visit the sicke in person, and to conferre with him of the causes and other occurrences of his sicknesse. Euen so for the cure of the Worlds infirmi∣ties, let vs call in the World himselfe, question with him, feele his pulses, and looke vpon the diseased parts of his body, whereby the Cure may become the sooner remedied, which now seems desperate and incurable. In such wise did this aduice please the Lords of the Con∣gregation, that they suddenly commanded the World to be called vnto them, who incontinently made his repaire, being drawne in a Coach by the foure Seasons of the Yeare, and by them was led into the Delphick Palace. Hee was a man well stricken in yeares, yet seemed to be of a galliard and robustuous complexion, which betokened that hee might liue many yeares longer. Onely it seemed, that he had a wheezing in his pipes with some difficulty of breath, and in speaking he shewed himselfe to be somewhat hoarse, and wept continually, which argued he ayled somewhat, and laboured as yet more with some grieuous tormenting paine in his braine or some other inward part of his body. The Philosophers askt him, how hee had his face so ruddy and Iouially appearing, which was a signe that he was in health, hauing store of pure radicall moysture, full of naturall heat, and could not but haue a good stomack. And they remem∣bred, that about a hundred yeares sithence, they had seene him looke yellow, as if hee had beene sicke of the yellow Iaundise, yet now it seemed vnto them, that hee was reco∣uered. But for all that they charged him freely to open his griefes, that they might prescribe thereafter some remedies to helpe him. Hereupon the World answered: My Lords, Presently after I was borne, I fell into sicknesses and griefes, whereof I languish at this instant. My face, which you behold so seeming red, is done ouer with Ladies licks, slicks, and other painting stuffe of the Levant. My Infirmitie is like the ebbing and flowing of the Sea, with the self-same wa∣ter in it, for all it seemes to increase, and fall; but with this interchangeable course, that when I haue a good counte∣nance outwardly, my griefe lies within mee, as I feele my selfe at this instant: And when I looke ill outwardly, I am in perfect health within. But if you please to try in what case I am indeed without dissembling any longer my mise∣ries, pull off my maske and gaudy coat, and you shall see when I am starke naked, that I am indeed but a liuing car∣case. The Philosophers out of hand disrobed him, and when the World was stript naked, they saw, that the poore vnfortunate Creature had a scurfe foure fingers thicke ouer his flesh, as bad as the Leprosie, or the Catholicke disease, which did eat into his flesh dangerously: Whereupon the wise Reformers tooke ten Razours, and euery one of them with a Razour began very diligently to shaue and pare off that thicke scurfe in apparance, and busied themselues so long, vntill they pierced to the quicke bone, but could not in this huge Colossus meet with one Ounce of good substan∣tiall flesh. Which when the Reformers perceiued, they stood a while amazed, and when they had reuested him with his maske and oolish Robes, they licensed him to depart. And then after conference among themselues, concluding the Cure too desperate and past helpe, they abandoned the care of their publike thoughts, and resolued to prouide for the sauing of their priuate reputation vnstaind. And there∣fore they all ioyned together to satisfie the common peoples expectations, and because they should see they were not idle, nor carelesse of their good, they caused Mazzon the Secretary to pen and publish the generall Reformation, wherein with a preamble of magnificall words, they testi∣fied to the world, the perpetuall care which his Maiestie tooke for the vertuous conuersation of his Learned Societie, of his indefatigable paines from time to time, sustained for the safetie of Mankind, and of the infinite labour and toyle of the Lords Reformers for the compiling and setting out of good Orders; and afterwards descending to particulars, they did put downe the prices of Coleworts, Pilchards, Pumpions and Melons. And now when all the Lords were ready to subscribe to the Proclamation, Thales the Milesian remembred them, that some slie Hucksters, when they sold Lupines, Pease, and Oaten meale, vsed a little Dish, that i was a most intolerable scandall not to foresee this disorder. This last aduice of Thales seemed very expedient to the whole Congregation, and as most necessary it was added to the Reformation, that these Dishes should be greater there∣fore from thence forwards. Presently after they caused the Gates of the Palace to be opened, and going into the Market place, they commanded the Cryer to reade the Proclamation concerning the Reformation of the World, which was done with such applause and ioy to euery man, that all Parnassus rebounded with their clamours and shouts, as tokens of the great contentments they tooke for this serious and long ex∣pected Reformation. But the wisest sort smelt out the drift, and laughed in their sleeues to see the rascality and foolish Idiots to delight themselues with bables, as babies with nuts. Men of vnderstanding know, that vices will abound, as long as men liue in the world, Vitia erunt donec homines; and that humane Prudence doth consist in this, to haue wit sufficient for this one difficult resolution, to forsake the world as another hath found it, or to liue as not to liue. CHAP. 18. The Duke of Hernia his Speech in the Councell of Spaine to a proposition, Whether it were ex∣pedient for his Catholike Maiestie to conclude a peace with his brother in law the Duke of Sauoy? I Could wish in these present stirres of Sauoy, that I were rather a Minister and an executioner of your Maiesties Will & Commandement, then an Inuentor of counsell, which if it chance to succeed ill in the euent, may returne preiudiciall to the Author, and hurtfull to your Maiestie. But since we are brought to this passe, that it is necessary to col∣lect the summe of your deliberations, and that this charge is now imposed on me, I will inforce my selfe, as farre as the weakenesse of my wit extends, to satisfie the obligation of the Loyalty, Affection, and Deuotion, which I owe vnto your Maiestie and my country. The most sacred King Treats now, whether he ought to lay downe armes and hostilitie, and to forgiue all such iniuries, as he receiued at the Duke of Sauoyes hands, by that meanes pleasuring the Princes of I∣taly, and the Pope in particular, who by his Nuntio doth ear∣nestly solicite the same? Or else whether your Maiestie ought to depriue him by force of warre, either of all his estate, or of part, thereby to secure your Dutchy of Milan from his trea∣cheries, being a member of so great importance, both by it selfe and by the opportunity of the situation, with the which it bindes together all the Body of this great Monar∣chy, that it is deseruedly held to be the key of all your King∣domes, seeing that with the benefit of this Dominion, wee inioy the preheminence of G noa, and the commoditie of the Sea with hauens, from whence in times of peace by Traf∣ficke, we receiue very great Gaine, and in times of warres we open a secure passage to our Armadaes and Armies? From hence the Kingdome of Naples is preserued, where we shall hardly arriue with our armed Gallies, through the midst of the Tirr ene Sea in a tempestuous Winter, if wee touch not and ride at Anchor in one of these places. From this State in briefe we are enabled to goe into Switz rland and Germany, there to leuie Souldiers for the Low-Countries, to giue and receiue aid from the confederate Princes; besides that with the situation of this place, being in the midst of Lumbardy, we hold the residue of Italy bridled, that they dare not stirre to oppose our wills. The which things although they bee knowne vnto this most prudent Councell, and better yet to your Maiestie, I would notwithstanding put you in minde thereof, because you might excuse me, if I seemed perchance fearefull or iealous for the preseruation thereof; and certaine∣ly when I shall conceiue that there is some securitie and suffi∣ciency in these courses which now are propounded, I will then rancke my selfe among the first to incline to peace, wish∣ing, that after our tedious and long warres in Flaunders, which haue consumed both the men and Kingdomes, wee might breathe a while, and recouer some fresh blood, and also refresh our drooping vitall Spirits, to be the better able one day gloriously to encounter and lead our armies against the Infidels, and to spread in their countries both the Christi∣an Faith and the Empire. But what security doe wee see in th se propounded Treaties? The Popes Nuntio doth pro∣mise, that if we would free the Duke of Sauoy from the feare he is in, to be preuented and oppressed, the Duke should like∣wise disarme, and hold himselfe alwayes hereafter your Ma∣iesties good kinsman and seruant, and that he shall neuer more minister cause of innouation, nor nourish any intelli∣gence preiudiciall to the State of Milan. And to secure vs from fraud, that he shall leaue his second Sonne at your Court for pledge. But he speakes nothing of alienating and separating himselfe from the friendship and aliance of France; nor that he will oppose himselfe against their forces, when they shall attempt to assault this State of Milan. And who doth not here see his fraud, as if we were so simple in beleefe, and knew not how to diue where his thoughts ten∣ded? Are not we sufficiently choked and made perfect of his cunning deuices? Seeing that the Count de Fuentes hath written from Milan, that we ought not to trust him; that his Treaties and practises holden with the King of France were most certaine for the surprizing of that State; let no man tell me, that it is securitie sufficient to lay a sonne of his in our hands for hostage, because he hauing other sonnes left him at home, among whom is his Eldest sonne, will neuer care to remoue him hence to hinder his designes, no more then King Francis was hindred and stayed from raising Armes against the Emperour Charles the fift, after hee had left his two sonnes in pledge: Or the Prince of Orange, who for all that he had giuen a Son of his in pawne, desisted not to conspire the ruine of Flanders against your most glorious Father. He hath declared himselfe what he is, and what re∣morse of conscience he feeles, that now hath complotted a∣gainst a King, his Kinsman and Benefactour; against that house, which twise restored him to the State which he holds, in that he would compasse and effect the French Match, not∣withstanding your Maiesties disagreement and disswasion. For your Maiestie fore-saw, that this match would proue a Seminary of Discord, and a rocke of Scandall. Now he try∣eth and compasseth by all meanes onely to auoid the present perill, and to watch an occasion to deceiue vs another time, or to take vs vnprouided. For all this, hee comes not with humilitie to procure pardon from the magnanimity and ge∣nerositie of your most sacred mind, but casting himselfe into the armes of your enemies with weapons in hand, and with threats he goes about to terrifie you, and with the greatest in∣dignity to force your Maiestie to a peace no lesse ignomini∣ous, then ill secured. We haue too much lost (if it be law∣full forme to speake the truth) our reputation in yeelding to a Truce with the States of Holland, though the same was ac∣counted necessary for our Affaires in regard of the difficulty to sustaine the charge of a warre so farre remote. To which now let vs adioyne this point, that there is not so vile an ad∣uersary, who dares not to moue and conuert his thoughts at euery nouelty, and already we see the rest of the Italians dis∣contented with our Greatnesse, willing to rise against vs, yea, and to call the Iewes and the Turkes in to their succour, albeit with their owne dangers, if God and the Angell Guardians of your Crowne doe not worke continuall miracles for our Defence, truely I cannot see, who shall deliuer vs. What then remaines? Most sacred King, I am of opinion, that Peace is not to be refused, so that the same be concluded with safety, the which can no way be, but by holding in deposit and impawned in your hands those Forts, which shall be thought fit by your Captaines, and to releeue them vpon his cost, and for your good, or at least that hee disburse the greatest part of the expence occasioned hitherto through his default. This Demaund ought not to seeme strange vn∣to him, seeing he hath wittingly and aduisedly vsed such in∣gratitude and deceits so oftentimes against you. Therefore we must let him vnderstand, that we may not repose any con∣fidence in him, except we haue these Forts in pledge, that so we may safely with our Reputation, reduce our matters to a sound issue, not leauing place for him in reason to complaine of vs as the Authours of the warre. But if the Duke will not consent to these our iust demaunds, and will refuse to receiue our Garrisons into his Forts▪ I am of the minde it is better to make warre against him, then by protracting time to ex∣pect troubles hereafter in our owne home. Another time we may runne into a greater hazzard, and wee may haue to doe with a more powerfull Prince. In the meane while it is conuenient for your Maiesties honour to aduenture all into the hand of Fortune, then voluntarily to yeeld with so great indignitie to conditions of so little safety. Howbeit I see not where those dangers lie, which some would make so great. I am sure, that in respect of the Iustice of the cause, where a man is not stirred with any desire to spoyle another of his due, but with necessity to preserue his owne State, and that with greater facility then some imagine, the Duke of Sauoyes power is not stronger then ours. I am sure, that hee is in a manner weake, and for two reasons to be slighted, as well in knowing him to be dangerously suspected, as also in that he is driuen to stand Armed and on his guard, which cannot but consume him in a short time. Nor doth their opinion any whit moue me, which say that he shall not want succours out of France, and out of those parts of Italy, which are inte∣ressed for their preseruation, because the French which should aide him, are deriued from a Gouernment, whereof the Head is a Woman, diuided in Religion, full of emulati∣on, and of sundry disagreements among themselues, where it is no hard matter still to nourish and increase their doubts with their dissentions and diuersified resolutions, so that the effects of them will fall out to be of small securitie, vaine, or long and vncertaine. And the dessignes of the Italians enuironed with our bor∣dering States are become weakned and worne out by the sodaine death of the French King, in whom they had groun∣ded their hopes; so that now being afraid of our nighbou∣ring Forces, and by the rising Fortunes of your Maiestie, they wil not presume openly to descend into this warre, but rather by obseruing other mens proceedings, and vainely trusting to the benefit of the time, they will stand idle as mournfull spectators of the tempest, which beates on their Neighbours fields; vnto whom it shall be in your Maiesties power to giue them that orme and Law, whatsoeuer your Benignity shall please to impose, and hereafter shall be adui∣sed according to the times. Neither let your Maiestie faile to entertaine them with sundry cautions and artificiall pro∣mises, and with protestations to affirme vnto them, that what you take away from their Father, you will restore it to the Sonne, granting that to your Bloud, which now you haue denyed to the Father for his ill deserts. With these hope∣full promises let the Prince Philebert be fed, and extraordi∣narily made much off. In the meane time then let the pro∣uisions for the warre be speedily hastened on, assembling souldiers out of the State of Milan, which are not enfeebled, as some (I know not whether they doe it of zeale or inte∣rest) doe expresse, to minister an occasion to the enemy of insulting. We haue men for number and valour sufficient for a greater enterprize then this, among these good store of old Souldiers exercised in the Warres of the Low-Countries; nor are there wanting Captaines of estimation and experi∣ence. And if your Treasure seemes somewhat scanted, you haue a way to find out so much money as you please, by departing with diuers Merchandises, and by feeding your Creditors with the particulars of the Fleets at their returne from the Indies, and also by other extraordinary meanes. And seeing that your Maiestie hath no warres at this present in any other parts, the ordinary Reuenues of your Kingdomes are enough to supply the charge of this warre. Besides the seat of the warre will fall out to be in a great part of the Enemies owne Territories, which will euery day produce more for∣tunate conditions. Onely let your Maiestie resolue, and de∣termine to passe (as Caesar did) the Rubicon; and then all things will succeed easie, plaine, and the fruits of the victo∣ry will alwayes ouercome the lightnesse of beliefe. Occasi∣ons are rare, and you had need to meet with them: For whosoeuer thinkes you may aspire to the Empire of Italy without vnsh thing your sword, or a iding the hazard, shewes that he hath had but small doings in the world. God and Fortune doe fauour the Aduenturous, the vigilant, and valiant; and despiseth the fearefull, the sleepy, and the pusil∣lanimous. Shall we for friuolous suspicions of remote dan∣gers contemne liuely and assured hopes? I doe then conclude, Most inuincible King, that vnlesse we may haue some Forts impawned into our hands, with∣out the which the State of Milan will still remaine in the same perill, we ought not in any wise to embrace that other Treaty, which is offered by the Popes Nuntio, nor to stay so long vntill the new King of France bee growne to his ri∣per yeares, lest hee be then incited and prouoked by this Duke, who is full of vast and irregular conceits to passe the mountaines to your dammage, but now whilest he is a Pu∣pill, it is necessary to preuent the inconuenience and to trans∣ferre the Warre into the Enemies Land. I beseech your Maiestie to consider with what good opportunity the way is made open for you to the Monarchy of Italy, and to the greater part of Europe, as God hath lately fauoured you. In what manner hath hee dissipated and confounded our Enemies Counsels by the sodaine death of Henry the fourth? That Kingdome is now without a Head, Italy disunited and weake, Germany all tottered and diuided; The Turke is beaten backe, and intangled in the Warres of the Levant, so that none is able to withstand your designes. The Iniury is apparant, which prickes you to a iust reuenge, and frees you from any blot of too much desire of Rule. Your Age which is now at the flowre, is pried into, and expected that it walke with some trauell through the way of Glory, with the which your Greatnesse shall no lesse bee conioyned, then the Aduancement of Religion, together with the safe∣ty of all Christendome.
